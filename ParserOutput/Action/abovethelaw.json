SUPER:  Viet - Cambodian Border, 1972. Jungle foliage whips in the fierce downdraft as -- 3   \"HUEY\" GUNSHIP with US Army markings becomes discernible. The chopper lowers toward a crude landing zone hacked out of the wilderness. We GLIMPSE Cambodian troops and several machine gun positions around the LZ. 4   EXT. JUNGLE - TWO ARMED AMERICANS - DAY watch from the edge of the landing zone. We recognize Nico and Fox, now in their twenties, dressed in the nonmilitary jungle attire that usually marks a CIA \"spook.\" 5   HELICOPTER touches down. THREE OLDER AMERICANS -- rough-looking, in their mid-thirties, all carrying some kind of medical bags -- disembark into the HOWLING ROTOR BLAST. They hit the ground nimbly, as if they've done it many times before. 6   LEADER OF THREE wears a khaki cowboy hat and packs a pearl-handled .45. 7   NICO AND FOX don't know whether to react with laughter or uneasiness.",

Gun Man falls, clutching his wrist in agony; the gun skitters away beneath a chain link fence, out of reach.

Bat Man CRASHES THROUGH the GLASS, hung up with just his head and shoulders dangling free. E)   Nico is spread out, feet wide, in a crouch. Crowbar Man sees his chance. He is the fiercest of the four, and the savviest fighter. He throws three consecu- tive vicious blows at Nico's head; Nico drops to one knee, dodges the blows, then intercepts the third, machete in hand, matches the arc of interception and whips the blade up -- straight into the crotch of Crowbar Man. Crowbar Man can't believe it. He re- mains frozen a moment, staring at Nico, then down at his own groin. F)   Machete Man, the first to be flipped, struggles des- perately to regain his senses. He tries to get Nico's gun from his own pocket, but Nico bats it a- way. Machete Man scrambles to his feet, in terror, bolts. G)   Nico snatches his gun from the sidewalk, glances to Bat Man who is still half-dangling from the van window. Nico gives Bat Man one parting punch to the head, then tears off after Machete Man -- 192   EXT. STREET - DAY Shrieks from passersby as Machete Man hurtles past, straight into the street. A car nearly hits him, he vaults its hood. Here comes Nico, in hot pursuit. He too leaps the car, whose owner is staring, cursing -- 193   ANGLE DOWN BLOCK An all-out foot face. 50. Machete Man is a speedster; he hurdles a row of trash cans. TWO YOUNG GIRLS, on a stoop, whistle as he passes.",

Patrons curse in Spanish as he barrels past -- 196   EXT. YARD BEHIND BODEGA - DAY Machete Man bolts from the bodega into a small patio with tables and chairs. He leaps the fence into the next yard, which belongs to a funeral home. He hurdles the headstone inventory, clambers up the fence on the far side -- 197   BACK TO NICCO pursuing along the same route. 198   MACHETE MAN claws his way to the top of the fence and onto a frame- work of two-by-fours which form an arbor-like canopy a- bove the third back yard. Plastic sheeting is tacked between the beams. Machete Man glances back at Nico, starts out -- tightrope-style -- across the two-by-fours. Nico reaches the fence behind the hood, starts also onto the two-by-fours. We hear FEMALE SCREAMS from below as the rickety structure starts to wobble precariously. Machete Man reaches the far side. A fire escape is ad- jacent; he grabs for it, starts up. Nico catches him by the ankle. The two crash together back onto the two-by- fours, which give way, sending them plunging into -- 199   BACKYARD OF FLOWER SHOP - DAY Four young Oriental women, potting plants, react with terror as the two bodies CRASH through. Machete Man scrambles away from Nico but is trapped in the corner next to the rear shop door. The flower girls can't move either; Nico and the hood are too near the door. The girls retreat to the far corner, squealing in fright.",

INTERSECTION - MORNING Nico's car pulls up at a stop light. He looks around without really seeing. An old lady pulls a shopping cart       * while a crossing guard takes some kids across the street.      * 221   ANOTHER CAR ROARS up out of nowhere, without two men inside, SCREECH- ING to a stop head-on to Nico's door. Its doors spring open -- 222   NICO dives toward his own passenger door -- 223   SECOND CAR - TWO MORE ARMED MEN leap out, OPEN FIRE with pistols and automatic weapons. 224   QUICK CUTS Nico's car riddled with a furious FUSILLADE.      WINDOWS BLOW OUT; the driver's door is shredded -- ABOVE THE LAW - Rev. 4/29/87                          64. 225   NICO - ON FLOORBOARD crawling frantically; shoving the passenger door open as a FIRESTORM of lead and FLYING GLASS BLAZES all around him. 226   FOUR MEN FIRING point blank (6 to ten feet) into Nico's car.   The men are cool, professional. 227   NICO spills from the passenger door onto the ground, scrambles like mad under his own car toward one of the attackers' cars. 228   PEDESTRIANS AROUND INTERSECTION scream and scatter in terror. 229   FOUR MEN FIRING as shells spew from the ejection ports of their weapons. 230   NICO'S CAR being chewed to pieces -- 231   NICO - UNDER MEN'S CAR                                          * crawling at full speed from the car's front to its back. On the ground, alongside the car, spent CARTRIDGE CASES RAIN like hailstones. 232   FOUR MEN As their magazines empty. The last shells spring free, GUN BARRELS SIZZLE, blue smoke fills the air. The leader waves two men forward to check their kill. At that instant: 233   NICO springs to his feet behind the men, the Sig Saur .45            * clutched in both hands. (He has crawled under both cars to envelop his attackers.)",
