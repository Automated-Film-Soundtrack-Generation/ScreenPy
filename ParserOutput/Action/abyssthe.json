He is accompanied by a large submersible, FLATBED, and by a Remotely Operated Vehicle, or ROV, call LITTLE GEEK.  Little Geek is an underwater robot which operated on the end of a cable-like control TETHER. It has a single video 'eye' in front, by which the operator pilots the little machine.  The rig's ROV pilots is ALLEN 'HIPPY' CARNES, who stands by the window twiddling his joysticks and drinking coffee.  His pet white rat, BEANY, crawls contentedly around his shoulders.

The pilot is white-knuckling his stick, trying to hold the great beast of a helicopter in position.

CAB ONE & MONTANA SAIL                                        79 Lindsey is approaching the monolith of the sail, maneuvering to clear the horizontal diving plane.  Then her lights go dim and her thrusters loose power. Suddenly a bright corona breaks around the bulk of the sail and SOMETHING appears right in front of her, a glowing object moving like a bat out of hell right at her!  It is slightly smaller than submersible and we only get a glimpse.  What we think we see in the diffuse glow is a translucent ovoid, open at the front with a spinning vortex of light inside... like some hallucinatory jet engine.  And it's hauling ass. Lindsey jinks left.  The object jogs right.  She fights the control as her sub slews around, slamming broadside into the sail.  K-BAM!  Her power comes back up.  Righting Can One, she spins to look through the aft viewport in time to see the object racing away in a broad arc.  It pulls a high-G turn and dives straight down. We see the object zip behind Flatbed.  One Night can't see it.  The thing spirals down into the darkness like a hit-and-run drunk, diving along the wall into the abyss until it is lost to view. HOLD ON Lindsey excited, amazed... dazed.  Her hands are shaking.  Suddenly Bud's voice blares out over the open frequency.",

Touches it as it passes over her. Lindsey is without fear, completely mesmerized. The thing completes its turn and dives gracefully down along the wall.  She is gently lifted by a backwash of turbulent water. About that time, Lindsey remembers she has a still camera, a little Nikonos. She fumbles to set focus and exposure with her bulky gloves as the beautiful machine glides into the depths.  Gets all set for a shot and... WOOSH!  The little 'scoutschip' whizzes past her from behind, startling her. She completely misses the shot of the 'manta ship'.

Goes out. Quiet lapping of water in the moonpool.  A beat.  Then... A cold luminosity suffuses the water beneath the moonpool opening, sending shadows shifting across the top of the chamber.  The surface begins to pulsate. Suddenly, the water itself rises, forming itself into a shifting, shimmering pseudopod as big around as a man's body.  The transparent form pulses... an amoebic mass shivering in the air. It stretches, becoming a more refined form.  Like a blindly probing glass python, it elongates and weaves across the room.  It extends and extends, stretching out from the moonpool, a shimmering tentacle.  The 'head' or tip, a featureless liquid bulb, seems somehow to be scanning as it moves forward, as if it can see where it's going. INT.

FROM INSIDE THE MAKESHIFT BUNKROOM, we see its tip extend inside. Sonny and One Night are snoring, oblivious.  Jammer is still unconscious.  The pseudopod, taking its time, checks them out and then moves on. IN THE MESS HALL, it's dark and quiet.  Lindsey has even fallen asleep in her chair, her head buried in her arms on the table.  The shimmering tentacle enters the room in total silence.  It sways gracefully in to air, searching. It undulates across the room, hanging about five feet in the air, surveying everything.  It moves past Lindsey.  Sensing something, she lifts her head, turning... sees the apparition next to her. Her eyes go wide.  Amazement, but not fear.  The tentacle is moving on, still searching.  Lindsey shakes Bud awake, clapping her hand over his mouth. Bud blinks twice, then freezes.  When she lowers her hand his mouth is hanging open like a total goon. Bud chucks his pillow are Catfish, on the next table. Catfish cracks one eye open.  Turns away.  Turns right back... both eyes open now.  Sensing movement, the thing turn back toward them.  It seems to recognize Lindsey.  It doubles back on itself in a loop and comes right up to her.  She holds her ground, fascinated. The bulbous tip forms suddenly into a human face... her face.  It is water, still clear and undulating... but definitely Lindsey.  She gasps in surprise. The liquid-Lindsey gasps soundlessly... a perfect mimic of her expression. Lindsey laughs involuntarily.  It laughs... without sound.  Lindsey makes a face, sticking out her tongue... testing it. The liquid-Lindsey does the same.

Coffey is momentarily stunned by the cold, giving Bud time to haul himself out, hoping to make it to the door. Coffey launches from the water and grabs him legs. He pulls himself up as Bud kick out.

Flatbed scrapes through between twisted conduit, metal screeching on metal. INT.

Through the lattice of conduit under the rig he can see Flatbed moving forward from its exit point under the stern.  Bud see a shortcut under the platform. He kicks along a lattice a pipes, heaving himself along in frantic hand-over- hand stokes.  He reaches for Flatbed's stern as it passes. Misses the last hand-hold... but just manages to seize a tie-down trailing behind it.  He is jerked along behind the sub. Bud holds on with both hands as he is buffeted in the wake of the powerful thrusters.  Flatbed gathers speed, moving out toward the edge of the abyssal wall.  The current slams him, spinning him like a fishing lure.  He pulls himself forward slowly until he can grip the stern rail of Flatbed's platform. LOW ANGLE, look up the wall.  Flatbed appears over the edge and stops. Hovering. ON THE BACK OF FLATBED.  Bud has the break he needs.  He scrambles up onto the deck and opens and equipment locker.  Nothing in it but one of the yellow nylon safety lines.  The big arm begins to unfold, lifting Geek/ROV. INT./EXT. FLATBED                                                       180 Coffey works intently.  His eyes are the cool ice of lethal madness in a face streaked with blood.  He brings the ROV into view with the boom arm. GEEK/ROV had a passenger.  Brigman.  The diver is holding Geek's skid with one hand, doing something with the other.  He turns to look at Coffey. EXT. FLATBED/DEEPCORE                                                   181 Coffey releases the ROV with the gripper and makes a grab at Bud with the steel claw.  Bud dives.  The gripper hits his helmet a glancing blow.  Bud kicks away rapidly, letting nylon rope pay out.  We see he has managed to tie one end to Geek's skids.  Coffey hits the button to activate the ROV, sending an acoustic pulse to Geek's transponder.  The little robot, pregnant with its load of death, turns nimbly around and dives out and down toward the void. Coffey pivots his bid machine toward Bud.  Bud strokes rapidly to a large jumble of wreckage.  He loops the rope around a twisted pipe.  Big Geek is hauling ass away from him.  The line snap taut an instant later.  The ROV strains, like a Rottweiler on a leash... trying to go.  The rope is slipping as Bud fights to make a knot. Flatbed slews around, thrusters whining.  As it banks, it hurls up clouds of sediment from the escarpment face. Through the front panel we see Coffey jerking on the controls. The big arm extends menacingly.  The smaller from manipulators open.  An enormous predatory instinct, its lights blaring. The big machine roars forward.  Straight at Bud. Bud gets his knot partly done.  See Flatbed looming. Glare-lit in its lights, Bud grabs a handlehold and pulls himself downward as Coffey closes the last few feet. One manipulator slams into his backpack, tumbling him, and the sub's underside rakes across his legs as it passes over.  Flatbed crushes into the tangle of pipework.  K-CRUUUNCH!! INT. FLATBED                                                            182 Coffey is slammed hard over the controls, up into the front dome port.  He gets back in the seat.  Strains to free his machine. EXT. DEEPCORE/BIG GEEK/FLATBED                                          183 Bud swims clear, diving down at an angle along the wall, hoping to stay in Coffey's blind area.  Flatbed backs out of the wreckage in a cloud of debris. It pivots toward Bud.  Moves after him. Nearby, the ROV is whining mindlessly, trying to please.  Trying to GO. DETAIL OF ROPE attached to wreckage, as Bud's knot begins to slip.  The nylon line starts to play through the knot slowly. BUD has gotten himself into a bad position.  Along the bare rock face of the cliff wall he is naked, nailed in the spotlights like a rabbit in front of a truck.  Coffey puts the hammer down, thrust levers all the way forward. Flatbed surges forward, multi-limbed and demonic.  There's no cover, side to side, up or down. Coffey has him head in his lights.  Suddenly a bright glare blasts in, blinding Coffey.  He looks up to see Cab One rushing down upon him, full throttle. At the last moment LIndsey slams the thrusters full-lock and the submersible slews sideways, slamming its heavy skidplate into Flatbed's cab.  Coffey is smashed sideways by the shock.  He fights to control his vehicle.  Lindsey looks up to see Coffey's sub gun it up over the wall, out of sight.  She cruises up over Bud.",

They are slammed viciously as Coffey's submersible hammers into them.  She hits full throttle.  Coffey floors it after Lindsey, ramming her from behind with his more powerful vehicle.  With difficulty Lindsey maintains trim. She arcs back toward the rig.  Flatbed slams her again, for the side.  She fights for control. INT./EXT.

The two subs are dodging between the cylindrical modules at full throttle, slamming into each other and the steel pressure hulls. Coffey sideswipes the smaller sub, jamming it sideways.  It screeches along the flank of one of the trimodules. They head out over empty terrain in a flat-out speed run. Lindsey is jinking and dodging as Flatbed, roars along behind her, tearing up the bottom with its powerful backwash.  Lindsey carves hard around a rock pinnacle, finding herself running parallel to the edge of the abyssal canyon. Coffey is ramming, hammering from behind, then from side to side. Lindsey snarls.  He's pissing her off.  He shouldn't do that. Ahead, out of the blackness, another outcropping. Lindsey rises, cuts right. Smashes down into Coffey's craft.  Timing it just right.  He skids catch in the rocks. Flatbed slews violently, nosing down.  Crushing into the rocky bottom. Pressing the advantage, Lindsey hammers into Flatbed from behind. It smashes full force into a second spire, spinning out of control. Tangles together, the subs slide down an embankment toward the edge of the wall.  With her one remaining thruster she jerks clear of Flatbed and grounds her crippled sub.  Flatbed tumbles over the edge. ANGLE DOWN THE WALL as it falls, trailing a cloud of sediment like a comet's tail, down into the unfathomable blackness below. INT.

As the pressure intensifies the hull begins to groan, and steel fitting scream with the enormous load. A tiny silver fracture shoots partway across the front bubble.  Grows. Coffey gives up fighting.  Just stares, wide eyed, at his death.  A damned soul dropping into the bottomless pit. The fracture line arcs rapidly across the dome port. Suddenly, a scythe-like curtain of seawater, under tons of pressure, slashes into him.  A moment later the bubble implodes, and Coffey disappears in a bloody froth of churning water, air and glass shards. EXT.

His chest barely moving. A strange illumination bathes his face and his eyes open.  He blinks.  Weakly, he raises his head, facing the source of the radiance. BUD'S POV... A glowing figure hovers before him, like a vision.  It seems to be an angel.  Seen closer, as it drifts toward him, we see that it is an extraterrestrial being, bioluminescent like some deep-sea fish.  Its body and limbs are transparent, and it resembles a figure made of blown glass.  A delicate mantle or veil billows out around its like a corona, which pulsates gently, propelling the being with the hypnotic grace of a Spanish dancer.  The head is refined and strangely anthropomorphic, with large eyes that convey a cold, dispassionate wisdom. It is stunningly beautiful. The creature settles toward him.  Unafraid, Bud extends his hand. Its slender, blown-glass digits grasp his bulky glove.  It pulls him up from the benthic ooze and they glide together down the slope, deeper into the abyss. At the limits of visibility we see faint, glowing forms moving below.  They resolve into NTI ships.  Tiny ovoids, like the little scoutship that Lindsey nearly collided with at the Montana wreck.  The larger manta-ships.  And others, strangely configured, moving in the darkness below like luminous fish. Suddenly the darkness explodes with light.  A vast, reticulated pattern of brightly glowing lines, like some enormous circuit diagram, appears below them, covering the floor of the abyssal trench.  It sweeps outward from the center, as if the light were surging through channels.  The NTIs are revealing their home to Bud.  The ships move among the spires like air traffic over a major city. EXT. N.T.I. STRUCTURE                                                   223 Bud and the creature descend until, between the lines of light, we see a dark surface of inhuman design.  The shape extends beyond the limits of visibility. Towers hundreds of feet high stretch upward from the curving surface.  It dwarfs their figures as the descend toward it, approaching an opening that soon yawns like a vast mouth. They are picking up speed, swept along by a powerful current, into the mouth- like opening. INT. N.T.I. STRUCTURE                                                   224 Bud stares around in awe as smooth, pearlescent walls blur past him.  It is a curving three-dimensional maze of tunnels, like a vast circulatory system, where controlled currents of water become freeways in three-dimensional space.  Tunnels divide, narrow, and reenter main-routes hundreds of feet across, as the pair race through in a dizzying blur. INT. FINAL CHAMBER                                                      225 Entering a smaller chamber they settle to the floor, and the NTI moves back a few feet. A shimmering plane or surface appears like a vertical curtain bisecting the chamber.  The seawater divides, like the Red Sea, into two rippling walls. They move apart.  Leaving Bud standing in a short, shimmering hallway. Weakly, he uncouples his helmet and pulls it free.  Drops to his knees. Doubles over as spasms wrack him.  Breathing fluid explodes from his lungs. He lies gasping and coughing on the floor, dragging in deep breaths of what he can only hope is air.  It is. Bud slowly recovers, sitting up.  His head is clearing.  This really is happening.  Beyond the shimmering, vertical surface of the water he sees the NTI being joined by others, move or less identical, until a group of seven is gathered watching him.",

Pandemonium reigns around them, people running, driving, evacuating inland. On the horizon, out to sea, a dark line has appeared. It grows in height as it comes closer, a wall of water stretching across the horizon, already hundreds of feet high and growing. EXT.

A roar fills the air, a thunder which drowns out the people's screams, even the rotors of the news chopper as the camera teams scrambles aboard.  They leave the announcer standing transfixed, his face blank, eyes tracking upward and upward as the ground begins to shake. EXT.

In a penthouse office suite, an executive watches the wave towering above him, blocking out the sun, a line of raging foam appearing as it arches over, about to break upon the teeming city. And then... The wave slows as it crests... And stops. IT SIMPLY STOPS. 2600 feet high and motionless except for a shimmering undulation of its surface in the bright sun.  There is quiet, a faint wind and calling of confused gulls.  Various reactions, as the thunder fades and people recover, only to stand awed before the vast, inexplicable manifestation.

The wave soundlessly subsides, slowly slipping back and down until the surface of the sea is normal again. VIDEO SHOT, HANDHELD, of a crowd of people watching the sea.  Moving from face to face.  Various reactions as people respond to what they can only understand as a miracle.  The faces... awed, stunned, tear-streaked... laughing.  The cameraman is just walking.  Some people turn to him and smile, or laugh, or whoop. A woman is collapsed on a bench, crying. A man is on his knees, shaking. Total strangers hug each other.

It gets wider.  Deeper.  Rapidly becomes a yawning pit. The ocean is OPENING. Now the surface is churned by turbulence.  Slow massive roils of tremendous power boil up from the depths. McBride leads a mass exodus onto the deck to see better. The open becomes a roaring maw a hundred yards across. The ships are like toys on the shimmering rim of the maelstrom. SOMETHING RISES IN THE CENTER OF THE OPENING.  A massive spire.  Smoothly curving and iridescent.  Off the starboard beam, a quarter mile away, another spire rises.  Tons of seawater fall from its sides with a THUNDEROUS ROAR, the energy of Niagara. Off the port bow... another spire. And another, beyond the destroyer Albany, dwarfing it. Six towers... plus one larger, in the center.  Rising. One the Explorer's deck, a shadow engulfs them as the nearest spire blocks out the sun.  The air, the sea, the deck... all vibrate with the THUNDER OF CREATION. And now for the payoff shot:  WE'RE HIGH, LOOKING DOWN.  THE SPIRES FORM A PERFECT RING A MILE ACROSS.  A VAST DARK FORM, LIKE A GREAT SHADOW, RISES FROM THE DEPTHS BENEATH THE SHIPS.  THE SPIRES ARE CONNECTED.  IT IS ALL ONE. THE NTI ARK. It surfaces with slow majesty, gently beaching all the ships on its broad back.  We recognize it as the structure into which Bud was led by the angelic being, which we assumed was a city.  The Explorer rocks gently on its flat hull, clunking massively to one side as it settles. The bridge crew watch millions of tons of seawater streaming off the back of the vast, slightly curved hull.  The missile cruiser rocks back and forth nearby, high and dry... its prop whining futility. ON EXPLORER'S DECK, McBride, Bendix, DeMarco, the rest of the Navy contingent... they're all standing there open-mouthed, in a dream-like daze. Touched by the hand of God.",
