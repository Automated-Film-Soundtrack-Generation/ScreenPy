INTERIOR - CORRIDORS Loose papers and articles of furniture hurtle through the passageways, as Roby hurries toward the rock, partly running, partly sucked along by the air current. EXTERIOR - SHIP - OUTER SPACE A huge plume of steam grows from the side of the ship, with all kinds of tiny loose particles tumbling out in it. INTERIOR - CORRIDORS Whipped by the hurricane wind, Roby crashes to a momentary halt against a wall.  As he hesitates there, trying to regain his balance, HE SEES THE CREATURE SCURRYING AWAY DOWN ANOTHER CORRIDOR. Ignoring the monster, he pushes off from the wall and starts running again. INTERIOR - CORRIDOR OUTSIDE AIR LOCK Roby stops himself by grabbing the edge of a doorway at the end of the hall down from the airlock.  Here, the wind is really terrific -- his clothes flap on his body and all kinds of things fly by -- the sound is a DEAFENING WHISTLE. Instantly, Roby starts turning a large wheel, which begins to close a sliding hatch door, closing off the air lock corridor.  As the hatch closes, THE CURRENT DECREASES, THEN IS FINALLY CUT OFF AS HE SEALS IT. Done in, he collapses to the floor. Then he clutches his throat and begins to gasp for breath.  Because of the thinness of the air, THE SOUND LEVEL IN THE SHIP IS VERY ODD -- THIN, DISTANT, ALMOST INAUDIBLE.  Roby is gasping loudly, but we can barely hear him; and his footsteps boom thinly like a man walking underwater. INTERIOR - CORRIDORS Clutching his throat, he comes across the others -- Standard and Hunter -- and they are all choking, clawing at their throats, gasping like fishes out of water.  They are sweating heavily and their noses bleed. They try to speak to each other, but the sound is so muffled we can only hear distant croaks. Standard mumbles something and stumbles down the hall.  The others follow him. INTERIOR - MAIN AIR TANK ROOM The door bursts open and Standard reels in, his footsteps pinging thinly on the metal flooring.  We see several rows of large oxygen tanks, all connected by hoses to a few petcocks. Standard staggers to these and starts twisting the handles, opening them.  THERE IS A PIERCING HISS OF ESCAPING AIR, AND THE SOUND LEVEL GRADUALLY RETURNS TO NORMAL as Standard and the others sink to the floor, gasping in the oxygen gratefully. Finally they have recovered enough to be able to sit up.",

                    "raw_text": "seconds! INTERIOR - LIFEBOAT He comes in on the run, hurls the catbox and bag toward the front, and does a dive over the back of the control chair.  He is no sooner in the seat than he hits the \"LAUNCH\" button. EXTERIOR - NOSE OF SHIP - OUTER SPACE The retainer clips drop away, and with a blast of ramjets, THE LIFEBOAT IS LAUNCHED AWAY FROM THE \"SNARK.\" INTERIOR - LIFEBOAT Roby is frantically strapping himself in, as the lifeboat accelerates away from the mother ship. EXTERIOR - SPACE The tiny pod of the lifeboat accelerates away from the larger bulk of the SNARK.  The scene is strangely serene for such deadly circumstances. INTERIOR - LIFEBOAT Roby finishes strapping himself in, then he reaches and grabs the catbox.  The cat is YOWLING.  Roby hugs the box to his chest and hunches his head down over it. EXTERIOR - SPACE The SNARK drifts ever farther away as the lifeboat leaves it behind, until it is barely a point of light. THEN IT BLOWS UP. AN EXPANDING ORANGE FIREBALL WITH PIECES OF METAL FLYING IN ALL DIRECTIONS. INTERIOR - LIFEBOAT The shockwave hits the escape craft, jolting it and rattling everything inside.  Then all is quiet. Roby unhooks himself from his straps, rises, and goes to the back of the lifeboat.  He stares out through the porthole.  His face is bathed in orange light. EXTERIOR - SPACE What he sees is the boiling fireball, now fading and fizzling away into nothingness, and a couple of pieces of debris floating past. INTERIOR - LIFEBOAT Roby's expression is mournful as he watches the final obliteration of his ship and friends. BEHIND HIM, THE CREATURE EMERGES FROM SOME HIDING PLACE -- IT HAS BEEN INSIDE THE LIFEBOAT ALL ALONG. The cat SCREECHES. Roby whirls, and finds himself facing the thing across the length of the boat.  It squats, then pulls out its trophy -- a man's arm. It begins to eat the arm, watching Roby. His first thought is for the flamethrower -- unfortunately, it lies on the floor right next to the monster.  Next he glances around for any place to hide.  His eye falls on a tiny locker containing a space suit, with the door standing open. He begins to edge toward the locker.  The creature rises.  He freezes. It throws down the arm.  With that, Roby dives for the open locker door, hurls himself inside, and slams the door shut. INTERIOR - SPACESUIT LOCKER There is a clear glass panel in the door, and the thing puts its face right up to the glass, peering in at Roby.  The locker is so small that Roby's face is only inches away from the creature's.  The sight is disgusting.  It turns its head, looking at him in curiosity. Then the MOANING OF THE CAT distracts it. INTERIOR - LIFEBOAT The creature waddles over to where the pressurized catbox sits.  It bends down and peers inside.  The CAT YOWLS LOUDER. It picks up the catbox in its tentacles. INTERIOR - SPACESUIT LOCKER Trying to distract the monster away from the cat, Roby TAPS ON THE GLASS. But the monster reacts so fast that its face is instantly back at the glass, startling the hell out of Roby. Getting no more interference from him, the thing returns to the catbox. Roby looks around.  He spies the spacesuit.  Quickly, he begins to pull it on. INTERIOR - LIFEBOAT The creature picks the catbox up in its tentacles and shakes it to see if there is anything inside.  The cat MOANS. INTERIOR - SPACESUIT LOCKER Roby is halfway into the pressure suit. INTERIOR - LIFEBOAT The creature throws the catbox down.  It clangs, and bounces.  The thing picks it up again and hammers it against the wall.  Then it jams it into a crevice in the wall. With one tentacle, it begins to pound the sealed catbox into the crevice.  The cat has gone beyond hysterics. INTERIOR - SPACESUIT LOCKER Roby pulls on the helmet, latches it into place, then turns on the oxygen.  With a hiss, the suit fills itself. In a rack on the wall is a long metal rod with a blunt rubber tip. Roby peels the rubber off, revealing a sharp steel point. Again he raps on the glass. INTERIOR - LIFEBOAT The creature turns.  It faces the locker, peers at him. INTERIOR - SPACESUIT LOCKER ROBY Try a little of this, you fucking bastard. HE KICKS THE DOOR OPEN. INTERIOR - LIFEBOAT The creature rises, but just in time to catch THE STEEL SHAFT RIGHT THROUGH ITS MIDRIFF. IT MAKES A HORRIBLE NOISE AND CLUTCHES AT THE SPUR.  The yellow acid begins to flow from the wound. Before the acid can touch the floor, Roby reaches back and pulls a switch -- BLOWING THE REAR HATCH. In a poof, the tiny atmosphere in the lifeboat is sucked out into space -- and the bleeding creature along with it.  Roby grabs a steel strut to keep from being sucked out, but as the creature passes him IT WRAPS THE END OF A TENTACLE AROUND HIS ANKLE. EXTERIOR - LIFEBOAT - OUTER SPACE Roby is now hanging halfway out of the lifeboat, with the thing clinging to his leg.  He kicks at it with his free foot, but it won't let go. INTERIOR - LIFEBOAT Looking for any salvation, Roby grabs the hatch control lever and yanks it. The hatch slams shut, closing Roby safely inside but TRAPPING THE END OF THE CREATURE'S TENTACLE IN THE DOORJAMB. It instantly releases Roby, who staggers back. EXTERIOR - LIFEBOAT - OUTER SPACE The creature is now outside the lifeboat, in the vacuum, squirming, the tip of its tentacle caught in the closed hatch. INTERIOR - LIFEBOAT Where the tentacle is caught in the hatch, it is wounded, and is starting to foam with acid, eating away at the metal. Roby stumbles forward to the controls and pushes a lever labeled:",

As it tumbles into the distance, pieces drop off it -- it bloats -- then bursts, soggily, sending a spray of particles off in all directions.
