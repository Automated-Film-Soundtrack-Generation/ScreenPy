She looks into its tangle of arms and cables, inches away. Looks away.  Her eyes snap back.  SOMETHING LEAPS AT HER FACE.  She SCREAMS and topples off the table, splashing to the floor.  Newt shrieks and scrambles away as Ripley hurls the CHITTERING creature off of her.  It slams against a wall of cabinets, clings for a moment, then leaps back as if driven by a steel spring.  Ripley scrambles desperately, pulling equipment over on top of herself, clawing across the floor in a frenzy of motion.  In a blurr of multijointed legs the creature scuttles up her body. She tears at it, but it is incredibly powerful for its size.  It moves like lightning toward her head, avoiding her fumbling hands.  Newt screams abjectly, backing away, until she is pressed up against a desk in one corner. Ripley has both hands up, forcing the pulsing body back from her face.  The thing's tail whips around her throat and begins to tighten, forcing the underside of its body close to her.  Ripley thrashes about, knocking over equipment, sending instruments CLATTERING. Water streams over her, into her eyes, blinding her and making it impossible to get a grip on the creature's body.",

Squeezing itself inexorably onto the desk top...toward her. The legs of the chittering thing claw at Ripley's head, getting a surer grip even as she whips her head from side to side.  The obscene TUBULE extrudes wetly from the sheath on the creature's underside, forcing itself between the arms she has crossed tightly over her face. A figure appears at the observation window, a silhouette behind the misted-over glass.  A hand wipes a clear spot. Hick's eyes appear.  He steps back.  WHAM!  A burst of pulse-rifle fire shatters the tempered glass.  Hicks dives into the crazed spider web pattern and explodes into the room in a shower of fragments.  He hits rolling, his armor grinding through the shards, and slides across to Ripley.  He gets his fingers around the thrashing legs of the vicious beast and pulls.  Between the two of them they force is away from her face, though Ripley is losing strength as the tail tightens sickeningly around her throat.  Hudson leaps into the room, flings Newt away from the desk to go skidding across the wet floor, and blasts the second creature against the wall.  Point-blank.  Acid and smoke. Gorman appears at Ripley's side and grabs the tail, unwinding its writhing length like a boa constrictor coil from her throat.  All of them grip the struggling,",

Ripley realizes she ducked under part of it a moment before.

The Queen goes berserk, SCREECHING like some psychotic steam whistle. Ripley lays about her with the flamethrower, igniting everything in sight with an insane fury.  Eggs shrivel in the inferno, and figures of warriors and drones vanish in frenzied thrashing.  Over all is the Queen's shrieking as she struggles in the flames.  Two warriors emerge from the boiling smoke, closing on her.  She pulls the trigger...an empty click.  DIGITAL COUNTER flashing crimson zeroes.  She drops the magazine, grabs another from her belt, rams it home and OPENS UP. The creatures vanish in rapid-fire flashes.

SOMETHING BURSTS FROM HIS CHEST, spraying Ripley with milklike android blood. It is the razor-sharp scorpion TAIL of the alien QUEEN. Driven right through him from behind.  Bishop thrashes, seizing the protruding section of tail in his hands, as is slowly lifts him off the deck.  Above them the Queen glowers from its place of concealment among the hydraulic mechanisms inside one landing-leg bay.  It blends perfectly with the machinery until it begins to emerge.  Seizing Bishop in two great hands it rips him apart and flings him aside, shredded, like a doll.  It descends slowly to the deck, the rotating lights glistening across its shiny black limbs, dripping acid and rage.  Still smoking where Ripley half-fried it.  The Queen is huge, powerful...and very pissed off.  It descends slowly, its six limbs unfolding in inhuman geometries. Ripley moves with nightmarish slowness herself, staring hypnotized...terrified to break and run.  She lowers Newt to the deck, never taking her eyes off the creature.",
