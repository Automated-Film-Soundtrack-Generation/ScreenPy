Pinkerton's taxi is CRUMPLED in a CRASH of metal and glass. Carnby narrowly avoids being crushed between the taxi and the building. With fluid grace, Carnby rolls to safety, landing on his feet. With a quick look back over his shoulder at Pinkerton in his crumpled taxi, Carnby runs. Pinkerton steps out of his taxi, seemingly unhurt by the crash. He looks around, but can't see Carnby anywhere on the street. Pinkerton runs for an iron-wrought staircase that leads up to a Pedestrian Bridge that hangs over the Street. At the top of the Pedestrian Bridge, Pinkerton looks up and down the street. He spots Carnby, running through the crowd of Pedestrians. Pinkerton leaps off the Pedestrian Bridge, arcing through the air with superhuman force. Pinkerton TACKLES the running Carnby to the ground, SLAMMING into him with a tremendous impact. But Carnby is quick. He takes the hit and spins Pinkerton around with a martial-arts kick. The kick sends Pinkerton",

Pinkerton drags Carnby along the conveyer belt. But Carnby grabs a hanging chain to steady himself. With a quick kick, Carnby uses the momentum to flip Pinkerton over him. Pinkerton flies through the air towards a large ice pick wedged into the wall. The sharp point of the ice pick punches right through Pinkerton's torso, impaling him. He is immediately killed. Carnby leans up against the wall, steadying himself. He pulls the stone carving out of his pocket to check it. In the fight, the carving has been cracked into pieces. But the broken carving reveals something hidden inside it, a small gold artifact that was concealed in the carving. The artifact is a gold circle, flat on the top and bottom, its thick round side engraved with intricate Abkani symbols.

Bodies lie everywhere, Captain Chernick, the First Mate, Crewman Barnes, the other Crewmen. Their weapons lie next to their slashed, ripped open bodies. Bullet holes are pocked around the Deck. Streaks of blood are smeared everywhere. Shell casings and corpses are all that remain of the battle. Tense, carefully looking around, Hudgens walks up to the empty gold container. He reaches into it, pressing a concealed panel at the back of the container. The panel opens, revealing a small artifact.

They conceal themselves behind a pair of columns, scanning the area before they step out. The lights are dim, with long shadows stretching out through the area. Aline is about to speak, but Carnby puts a finger to his mouth and shakes his head, no. The dead body of the Guard lies in a pool of blood on the ground. There seems to be no one else around. But then, silently, moving with a fluid grace, a XENOMORPH CREATURE emerges out of the shadows. The xenomorph creature is huge, terrifying. It is seven feet tall, covered in thick, dark scales. It stands on two legs, with long, powerful arms that end in razor-sharp claws and a segmented, spiked tail poised behind it. Its demonic head has black, sunken eyes and a severe jaw lined with jagged, fang-like teeth. The head is identical to the stone carving in which the lynchpin artifact was encased. Carnby and Aline look shocked. They freeze, not moving a muscle. Another xenomorph creature steps out of the shadows. The two creatures congregate in the middle of the room. They are the same hulking, grotesque brutes. The two creatures start to communicate. An unintelligible language passes between them. Suddenly, one of the creatures looks up, sensing something. The creature looks directly at Carnby and Aline, hiding behind the columns. The creature delivers a SHARP WHISPER. And with that, the creature fades into invisibility. It has totally disappeared. The second creature immediately follows suit, also fading invisible. (CONTINUED)",

They each carry a sleek, high-tech assault rifle with a lamp mounted on the top. They all wear full Bureau 713 combat gear, body armor with a headset comm-link and a helmet with a dark visor mounted on it. The creatures HISS in reaction and scramble out of the spotlights from the helicopter. The Agents immediately open FIRE. Their bullets glow with a pulse of yellow light as they streak through the air. All Carnby and Aline can see is the Agents shooting glowing bullets into the unnaturally long shadows. But the SQUEAL of one of the creatures shows that the Agents' bullets have found their target. As the glowing bullets hit the creature, it momentarily flashes visible, then invisible again. The two invisible creatures scatter, slipping away into the shadows. The Agents cut their zip-lines, dropping to the ground. As they land, they all flip on their rifle-mounted lamps. The bright blue beams cut through the darkness. Their movements are precise, controlled. They all have their rifles out, scanning the area. Agent Barr has a high-tech scanning device attached to his rifle. It is an updated version of Carnby's para-meter that monitors the electromagnetic energy in the vicinity. It is used to detect the presence of the xenomorph creatures. (CONTINUED)",

The scanner is connected to a large monitor on a dolly next to the slab. Fischer holds the scanner a few inches above Pinkerton's body, passing it along the length of him. The image on the monitor matches the movements of the scanner. It shows a real-time internal scan of Pinkerton's body, displaying the skeleton, internal organs, and so on.

Shelves are lined with ancient artifacts, small sculptures, and masks. Hudgens stops at a work station and pauses. A look of pain crosses his face. He winces, holding it in. He steadies himself. At the other side of the Lab is a large recess in the space. The opening is covered by thick cage bars covered in gold. The cage appears to be empty. But suddenly, an invisible creature SLAMS into the bars of the cage, trying to lunge at Hudgens. As it hits the bars, fingers of electricity jolt through it, making it visible for a split second. Hudgens watches calmly. He goes to a small dial built into the wall beside the cage. Hudgens turns up the dial. In the cage, jagged bolts of electricity jolt around the invisible creature. It SQUEALS and HISSES from the electricity. (CONTINUED)",

He quietly gets out of bed, letting her sleep. He pulls on a fresh shirt. Carnby pads over to the lab area and turns on a desk light. He sees the wrapped items Aline placed on his work station. Carnby unwraps the items. They are the three Abkani artifacts from the Museum. Carnby picks up the lynchpin artifact, turning it around. Something catches his eye. Carnby fiddles with the artifact.

Burke turns away from Carnby for a moment, trying to figure out what's happening. Carnby suddenly lifts his weapon and points it at Burke. Burke sees this, but before he can react, Carnby FIRES. Carnby's bullet WHIZZES past Burke and hits an ORPHAN dead center in the gut, sending him flailing back, dead. The Orphan was about to pounce on Burke. There's a moment as Burke and Carnby look at one another. Burke realizes Carnby just saved his life. The ORPHANS attack. They are the grown-up Children from Carnby's Orphanage. Like Pinkerton, they are difficult to kill, immune to pain, fast, and deadly. They all have the same gaunt, wild look, with sunken eyes and nearly clear irises. The Orphans leap out at the Agents, quick and fierce. They bite and claw and use their superhuman strength to throw around the Agents and tear them apart. The dark Loft is again lit up with glowing bullets, streaking through the darkness. The Agents' rifle-mounted lamps shine around, but the effect is chaotic, disorienting. (CONTINUED)",

The sand worm struggles, trying to bite Aline. She can barely hold it away from her. Her grip starts to loosen. The sand worm's snapping jaws are almost at Aline's face. She strains to hold it away. With the sound of a GUNSHOT, the sand worm's head explodes. It flops to one side, dead. Carnby stands behind it, his gun smoking from the shot. A sand worm bursts out and chomps down on Cheung's bad foot. She SCREAMS. Barr SHOOTS the worm that bit Cheung. Cheung falls back, her body seizing up from its poisonous bite. Cheung's body contorts. Barr grabs her as Cheung's head reels back and her body goes limp. She's dead. Burke turns, his face grim. He OPENS FIRE on the sand worms. With precision and intensity, he FIRES controlled bursts at any movement under the sand. Carnby FIRES along with him. After a few seconds, the movement has stopped. Aline, Carnby, Burke, and Barr stand together. They look down at Cheung's body. Over the comm-link, Burke can hear the sounds of the BATTLE going on up above them.",

The doorway opens up into a vast Cave, hundreds of feet high and wide, stretching off into darkness. The cave walls are rough-hewn rock, untouched by human hands. The walls of the Cave are marked with hundreds and hundreds of tunnels, pocking the rock like a hive, leading off into the depths of the mountain. Hudgens moves into the Cave, tentative, but excited. Suddenly, there's a SCRATCHING, SCURRYING sound. A xenomorph creature emerges out of one of the tunnels. Out of another tunnel comes a second xenomorph. And a third. Across the vast cave, dozens of xenomorphs creep out of individual tunnels. Hudgens steps further into the Cave. The xenomorphs approach him, their heads darting about. The xenomorphs surround Hudgens on all sides. His steps are careful. He reaches his hand out to one of the creatures. T he creature moves up to Hudgens' hand, smelling it. The creature lunges at him, ripping into him with its teeth. The other xenomorphs surrounding Hudgens pounce on him as well. The creatures tear Hudgens apart. Like a dam breaking, hundreds of xenomorphs start streaming out of the hive-like tunnel system of the Cave. Standing in the doorway, Aline sees the creatures coming.",
