He looks in the waste basket.  Wadded up candy wrappers. The bed by the window is neatly made.  Deckard looks under it, then runs his hands along both sides of the mattress. The closet.  There's one suit in it.  He pats it down. Nothing. A show box on the floor.  He stoops, takes out what looks like a pen from his pocket and care- fully traces it over the box.  Assured of its harm- lessness, he lifts off the lid. It contains a little stack of photos bound with a rubber band.  Deckard removes them, goes to the lamp by the balcony window and turns it on. A touching collection of family snapshots.  The kind of anonymous stuff sold by the bunch in dusty junk shops. The family dog.  Junior on the pony squinting in the sun.  Uncle Ben clowning with the kids.  The faded polaroid of Christmas morning.  Simple pictures of simple folks celebrating the family bond.

The only sound is the insidious PERKING of COFFEE BREWING in the background. Tyrell taps a sensor on his desk.  The door in front of Deckard and Rachael slides open.

Zhora, in just a raincoat, is not out of place in this flea market atmosphere.  Trying not to run, she slices through the mob as quickly as she can. Deckard is not far behind, dodging and side-stepping, trying to move against the tide of people scurrying for shelter. She comes to an intersection and turns out of the mall onto a less crowded street.  She glances over her shoulder as she breaks into a run and runs right into a couple of pedestrians.  All three go down. Deckard comes out of the crowd in time to spot her get- ting to her feet.  She sees him and runs.  The two ped- estrians are in his line of fire.  He runs past them and drops to one knee, leveling his laser.",

With his bottom lip between his teeth, it hurts to move so fast, Deckard jack-legs it into the street and jumps in front of the first car coming.  It screeches to a stop.  Deckard scrambles for the door, but the guy be- hind the wheel has other ideas.  He peels out fast. The next car slows down and swerves trying not to hit him.  Deckard goes for the door and before the old ma- tron inside can lock it, Deckard's yanked it open and jumps in.  She screams as he pushes her into the pas- senger seat and jams the car into a wrenching about face.  The lady squeals like a pig as the momentum plasters her against the door. Deckard slams it around the corner and guns it down the street.  It's long and it's empty and it's going by fast. Nothing the old lady cares to see -- she's got her hands over her eyes, whimpering, hoping she'll faint before she dies. Deckard takes the next left so hard he almost lays it over.  As the car bounces off the curb he floors it. Zhora's a hundred yards ahead, halfway down the street, trying to make it back into the crowded mall.  She's running fast, but the car is faster. As he passes her, Deckard hits the brakes and skids broadside seventy feet.  The door flies open and he rolls out FIRING. Zhora's ducking it with no where to go, except... The showcase window on her left EXPLODES as she crashes through. It's a corner shop joined to a series of stores, front- ing the mall.  Deckard runs to the opening she's made and pours FIRE through the tunnel of her jagged wake as Zhora breaks through one window after another, getting sliced, getting shot, trying to get away from Deckard's laser.  But she doesn't. His last shot burns a hole through the base of her skull.  It kills her but doesn't stop her.  Her speed takes what's left of her through the last two windows and into the street where she runs into a parked car with such force that she embeds herself in the side of it. Hunched over, breathing hard, Deckard comes slowly for- ward.  The crowd starting to gather.  There's something for everybody and they're coming from all directions. Deckard moves through them, edging to have a look. It's not a good thing to see.  It looks like Salome and the car tries to eat each other.  A bloody feast of metal and flesh. Deckard bows his head, sick, exhausted.  So much commo- tion he doesn't notice THREE COPS closing in from behind.",

The smile turns into a growl as he feels the bones in his hands crack.  Before the scream comes out of his mouth, Batty stifles it. Tyrell claws at the iron fingers, but they're sinking into his face.  Placing his other hand behind Tyrell's head, Batty squeezes them together and squashes the man's head like a melon.

Two weight-reducing machines are flapping and grinding away like idiots.  Deckard's eyes stop on the woman. She dangles a few feet off the floor, hung by the shoulders through rings suspended from the ceiling. Her head is slung forward, her body limp and slightly swaying. Deckard pushes open one of the doors until it touches the wall.  Slowly, he advances toward the hanging figure, keeping an eye on the mirror to cover surprises from the door.  He's not breathing hard.  His heart isn't pound- ing.  Deckard's in his element. Close enough to look up into her face, he stops.  It isn't grisly death that causes the reaction in his eyes.  It's the innocence of her angel face. It's not something he has time to consider.  In the mirror behind him, he sees the door starting to open. Deckard spins.  He shouldn't have.  Pris' legs snap up, crack the laser out of his hand and clamp around his neck. Slowly, the door swings closed, but Deckard doesn't notice.  His carotid artery is no longer sending blood to the brain.  He jerks up his foot and reaches down. As his fingers close around the ankle laser, Pris' fingers close around his wrist.  Deckard's hand opens like a flower.  The laser drops to the floor as his eyes roll back into his head.",

He's propelled fifteen feet across the room, slams into a machine and falls to the floor. Pris flies off the rings and comes at him. Deckard reaches out to pull himself up, but she's al- ready there.  Not too hard and just in the right place, she kicks him in the stomach.  He goes back to the floor, gagging for air.  Oh-so-precisely she reaches out with a long index finger and flips the switch on the machine. It's a flab eliminator with a vibrator belt.  Normally an innocuous piece of equipment, but the motor housing on this one is missing.  Lots of GRINDING METAL.  A bad place for flesh and bone. But that's where Deckard's hand is going.  An eight- year-old against a full-down man.  In two more seconds his hand will be ground round.  Deckard tries to pull his hand loose.  It won't come.  He yanks hard, but it's welded in hers. His face is twisted and strained as he raises a leg, wedges his foot against her chest and pushes with all his might.  The hold breaks.  They topple back.  Deckard hits the floor gulping to catch his breath.  Pris is up and coming for him again.  She hovers over him.  Deckard rolls out of the way as she comes down like a pile driver. Reflexively Deckard raises his arm to protect himself. Pris just smiles, takes hold of his foot and drags him across the floor.  She doesn't like to leave a piece of work unfinished.  They're going back to the machine. He goes by a weight-stand of dumbbells and grabs hold. It doesn't stop him.  He's sliding over the floor like it was ice, weight stand in tow. Pris gets to the machine, yanks his foot up and forces it toward the opening.  Deckard sits up, a five-pound dumbbell in his hand, and clobbers her in the back.  It knocks her off balance, but she doesn't let go of his foot.  She hooks out with a fist but misses.  He gets her with a roundhouse in the face. She goes to the floor and Deckard's up, the dumbbell over his head, coming down with it.  Fighting for her life now, Pris drives a foot into his chest.  It lifts him off the floor.  He flies back across the gym and lands in a heap. No more games.  Pris is furious and moving fast.  She rips a steel bar out of the wall and, holding it over- head, charges him like a samurai.  As she comes down for the kill, she freezes. Deckard landed near the laser.  He crawls towards it. As in a nightmare, it takes forever.  But he gets there. He reaches out and grabs the laser, rolls over and takes careful aim.  She charges towards him, screaming her rage.  He FIRES as she comes. The shot amputates her left arm at the shoulder, but her hand doesn't let go of the bar.  It dangles crazily in front of her as she charges forward. He PUTS THE NEXT ONE through her neck.  Pris hiccups a rope of blood as she flies through the air and crashes next to Deckard.  Dead. He lies next to her, chest heaving.  Slowly he rolls over and gets to his hands and knees.  Panting, he stag- gers to his feet and stands over her, swaying slightly. The sound that escapes his throat is raspy and dry.  It might not sound like a war cry, but it is.",

He kicks the door open and dives through head first and hits the floor in a roll, POURING FIRE into the far corners of the room but the room is empty.  There's a kitchen bar, a closet and a bedroom door, both closed.  Deckard's breathing is the only sound.  No response from either door. Maybe it was a sound, maybe intuition, but suddenly Deckard twists around and FIRES several shots into the closet.  The smouldering door slowly creaks open. Mary is huddled in the rear of the closet.  Her hand out like somebody about to catch a ball but afraid of it.  In her other hand she clutches a button-eyed monkey.  Her face is bewildered, frozen in fear, her body riddled with holes.  No recognition gap here. Deckard SHOOTS her through the neck to make sure.  Mary falls to the floor, like a puppet with her strings cut. Deckard backs away from the pathetic figure in the closet and sits on the sofa, unable to take his eyes off her. Deckard lays the laser down next to him, holds out his hand and looks at it.  It's steady.  He drops it in his lap, closes his eyes and leans back.",

He pauses for breath, then lays back, wedging his feet against Batty's shoul- ders and pushes.  Inch by inch the body goes over the edge.  Then all at once it drops.  But the hand holds and the weight of the body takes Deckard with it.  As Deckard slides over the edge, he grabs hold of the railing. Deckard's hanging three hundred feet over the basement floor, supporting himself and Batty's corpse -- almost four hundred pounds of stress on his fingers. With his free foot he chops away at Batty's hand, try- ing to break it loose.  But it's not working.  Deckard's fingers are starting to slip. His face is a mask of agony as he wedges his heel over Batty's thumb.  With the help of gravity and everything he's got in his right leg to push with, he pushes.  The thumb breaks loose.  Batty falls. The SOUND OF HIS BODY HITTING BELOW sounds good, but Deckard doesn't notice.  He's in an awkward position. He must reverse the way he's facing to pull himself up. He lets go with his right hand and crosses it over the left.  Then turns the left around so he's got an over- hand grip. Like a man doing his last pull-up... the one that can't be done, Deckard pulls himself up, throws a foot over the edge and grapples and heaves and wiggled himself onto the cold solid steel of the stairwell landing. And lies there, body jerking spasmodically, slowly clenching and unclenching his cramped hand, but it's his burning cheek against the cool metal he's most aware of. Dizzy, hot, lungs on fire, he stands -- and putting one foot in front of the other, Deckard descends the stairs.",
