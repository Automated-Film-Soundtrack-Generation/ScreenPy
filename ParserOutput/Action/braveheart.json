William looks up and their young eyes meet; her sad blue eyes hold William's as the grave diggers cover the bodies. Then a lone, mounted figure appears at the crest of the hill above them. Tall, thin and angular, in black clerical garb, he looks like the grim reaper. The girl hurries back to her mother's side; everyone watches in silence as the figure rides down to them.

Farmers are roasting a pig; women are comparing handiwork; young men are tossing huge stones in the traditional Highland games -- and everyone is noticing William's arrival, especially the farm women with daughters of marriageable age. Among those watching William arrive is Campbell, grown older now; and with his old rebel friend, MacClannough. William dismounts and ties his horse to a willow.

He charges on; his horse LEAPS the barrier as Wallace simultaneously swings the broadsword -- and he's more than an expert: the tip, at the end of a huge arc, nearly breaks the sound barrier and the blade bites through the corporal's helmet, taking off the upper half of his head! The soldiers try to rally, to shoot him in the back as his horse leaps over them. One of them has sighted William's back... But Hamish and his father crash into them! It's a wild fight; old Campbell takes an arrow through the shoulder but keeps hacking with his sword; Hamish batters down two men -- and more Scots arrive! They overwhelm the soldiers.",

Opposite William stands old MacClannough; he stares across the open hole that accepts the body of his daughter, his eyes full of pain, and then staggers away. Wallace kneels at the graveside in unspeakable grief. From within his shirt he withdraws the embroidered handkerchief she gave him, and the bloodstained strip of cloth he gave her. He places the strip over her heart, and as the gravediggers fill the hole her returns the handkerchief to its spot over his own heart.",

Still Wallace fights back, meeting the English charge. The Scots hold their own. An English knight tries to ride over William; he knocks the lance aside, and tough the horse slams into him, William also unseats the rider. The rider rolls to his feet. William struggles up to meet him -- and comes face to face with Robert the Bruce. The shock and recognition stun Wallace; in that moment, looking at Robert the Bruce's guilt-ridden face, he understands everything: the betrayal, the hopelessness of Scotland. As he stands there frozen, a bolt punches into the muscle of his neck, and Wallace doesn't react to it. Bruce is horrified at the sight of Wallace this way.
