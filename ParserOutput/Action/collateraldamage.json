Gringo music for a gringo bar. The place is busy, with plenty of local \"hostesses\" for the men. Even Armstrong, standing half-crocked at the bar, is flanked by two scantily-clad women. He's got a spoon hanging off his nose. So does one of the girls. Armstrong's trying to hang a spoon on the other. Gordy slips into the bar. Spots Armstrong through the crowd. Sees Armstrong's not wearing his cap, when... The girl with the spoon on her nose turns slightly, revealing she's wearing the cap. It's on backwards, but now Gordy can see the \"Deerborn\" logo clearly. Gordy wants the guerrilla travel pass inside the cap. It's a desperate move, but he's got no choice. Starts toward the girl, when... Gordy sees the thin federale enter the front door. The thin federale sees him at the same time. Begins moving in on him. Gordy moves faster toward the girl.   And... The girl unwittingly does him a favor by taking off the cap and setting it on the bar, where it's easier to grab, and then turns her attention to Armstrong's antics. The thin detective fights through the crowd after Gordy. Gordy's almost to the hat.

The Beaten Man signals two men to go out the hole. To the other man -- BEATEN MAN (in Spanish) Organize the others. Find him. The man goes. Outside, we hear him SHOUT orders to the guerrillas guarding the plantation. The Beaten Man turns to Felix. Felix is terrified. In a pleading tone -- FELIX (in Spanish) He can't be far. You'll catch -- BANG! The Beaten Man SHOOTS Felix in the head. Then exits. OFF Felix, dead, his blood mixing with the water still streaming across the floor... 225   EXT. PLANTATION - MOMENTS LATER                               225 The guerrillas report to the Beaten Man. They can't find Gordy. To the men guarding the plantation -- BEATEN MAN (in Spanish) Keep looking. He signals his men to come with him.   They get into the Suburban. Whereupon we FIND... 226   UNDER SUBURBAN                                                226 Gordy's hanging onto the chassis. With the large tires and high ground-clearance, there's just enough room to get his legs over the rear axle. He's just finishing rigging up a rope he took from the store room -- the rope's slung from one side of the chassis to the other, to support Gordy's back. He hears the ENGINE START, grabs the transfer case, and... 85. 227   SUBURBAN                                                     227 ROARS off with Gordy suspended below. The rear DRIVE SHAFT WHIRS madly, inches from Gordy's face. And, with each bump in the road, even with heavy- duty off-road shocks and springs, the undercarriage of the Suburban comes within inches of crushing Gordy's legs. ROCKS are PINGING everywhere. The dirt and the dust are choking. Even for a short distance, it's going to be a long, dangerous ride. 228   EXT. SUBURBAN (CAGUAN) - NIGHT                               228 As the TRUCK BLASTS down back roads and through the darkened town... 229   GORDY                                                        229 continues to suffer underneath. Even with the rope supporting him, he has to hold on with two hands. A vicious jolt suddenly loosens a grenade. It starts to slip free. Gordy can't stop it without letting go. The grenade falls, and... Gordy shoots out a hand and grabs it. Barely. The spoon just hanging on the end of his fingertips. Gordy can't use his other hand to get it. He needs the hand to hold onto the car. The grenade begins to slip. He's going to lose it. And just as it falls... Gordy does the only thing left. He slips a finger through the loops of the grenade pin. Just barely snags the grenade before it drops to the road. And then... Carefully, slowly -- praying that each bump doesn't jar the grenade off the pin -- with his other arm shaking and screaming in pain as he maintains a grip on the transfer case -- Gordy eases the grenade back onto his stomach, where he gets a better grip. Jams the grenade back. Then grabs onto the undercarriage once more, in time to relieve the muscle-tearing strain on his arm. 230   ABOVE GORDY'S WORLD                                          230 the Suburban passes the \"Cine.\"   The movie's over, just letting out. 231   EXT. GUERRILLA HOUSE - NIGHT                                 231 The Suburban pulls up to the well-guarded house Gordy saw the night before. The men get out and go inside, leaving the SUBURBAN RUNNING, clearly planning to leave again right away. 86. 232   GORDY                                                          232 carefully lowers himself to the ground. Slides out on the side away from the house. Hides behind a large wheel. The brightly-lit house is surrounded by coconut trees. Gordy watches the guards. When the guards aren't looking, he runs to the nearest tree. The sounds of the SUBURBAN'S ENGINE covers his footsteps. 233   TREES                                                          233 Gordy moves from tree to tree when the guards aren't looking, when he reaches one tree, and... 234   NEW ANGLE                                                      234 THUNK!   A coconut hits the ground next to him, and... One of the guards comes to investigate. The guard gets closer. Gordy inches around the tree. He can't get away without being seen. He nudges the coconut with his toe. Nudges it harder, causing it slowly to roll away, and... The guard picks it up. Never sees Gordy in the shadow of the tree, pressed against the trunk. The guard shows the coconut to a guard near the house, then walks back. 235   GORDY                                                          235 sneaks to another tree. Then reaches the house. He moves to a window. Peers into a room. No one's there. But we hear the sound of VOICES. Gordy creeps along the wall. Looks into another room, and... 236   INSIDE                                                         236 is a group of ELC guerrillas, including the Beaten Man, packing suitcases, etc. Leaving in a hurry. 237   GORDY                                                          237 scans the faces. Except for the Beaten Man, no face is familiar. A man with his BACK TO us stands, and there's nothing familiar about him, either. When... 238   ANOTHER ANGLE                                                  238 Directly in front of us, another man emerges from a room. He's also in ELC guerrilla camo.

His dirty face and clothes blend in just enough. The guard moves past. 244   ANOTHER ANGLE                                                244 When the coast is clear, Gordy moves to the large propane tank. He takes out the grenade. Puts the rubber bands around it, spoon and all. Grips the grenade in his hand, holding the spoon down, and yanks the pin. And then... Slowly, slowly, Gordy begins releasing his grip, allowing the rubber bands to take on the pressure of the spring- loaded spoon. If they'll do it... if the spoon goes now, Gordy's going up in the blast. Gordy continues to relax his grip. The rubber bands stretch. Stretch more. Keep stretching until they're barely holding the spoon... but they're holding it. Gordy quickly, carefully wires the grenade to the propane tank. Then takes out the Zippo, pulls it apart and removes the lighter fluid-soaked cotton. Holds the cotton just above the grenade and squeezes with his fingers. And... (CONTINUED) 88. 244   CONTINUED:                                                     244 Lighter fluid drops onto the rubber bands.    Gordy squeezes out as much as he can onto them. Then Gordy gets the hell out of there.   He finds cover. Ducks down. And waits. 245   CLOSEUP - GRENADE                                              245 The lighter fluid is dissolving the rubber bands. 246   BACK TO SCENE                                                  246 Gordy suddenly hears a woman's gentle SINGING.    He looks in the direction of the sound, and... Gordy sees the attractive Woman and the boy approaching on the road. She's singing a gentle song in Spanish. Gordy's eyes flash with alarm.   He glances at the house. 247   CLOSEUP - GRENADE                                              247 The lighter fluid continues dissolving the rubber bands, which are now beginning to lose their elasticity and stretch from the pressure of the spoon. 248   BACK TO SCENE                                                  248 Gordy looks back at the Woman and boy, closer now, walking toward the house. 249   FLASHBACK - NEW YORK                                           249 Anne and Matt wave to him across Madison Avenue. 250   BACK TO SCENE (PRESENT)                                        250 Gordy sees the Woman pull the boy close to her, lovingly. 251   FLASHBACK - NEW YORK                                           251 The BOMB EXPLODES, and Anne moves to protect Matt. 252   CLOSE ON GORDY (PRESENT)                                       252 He realizes the horror of what will happen.

Claudio OPENS FIRE with a MACHINE PISTOL, hitting two agents and scattering Gordy, Phipps and the rest. Selena SHOOTS the two escort people dead, then BLASTS away at the other people pouring out of the institute as she straddles the Ducati behind Claudio, and the powerful BIKE SCREAMS off down the street. Gordy jumps to his feet and runs after them. 361   EXT. BUILDING'S TOP FLOOR                                    361 BOOM! A MASSIVE EXPLOSION spits flame out of the windows of the building's top floor. 362   PEOPLE                                                       362 dive for cover.

Far down the block, the bike turns right onto another one-way street. 365   GORDY                                                        365 spots an alley on his right and turns into it. 366   EXT. ALLEY                                                   366 Gordy's now moving parallel to Claudio and Selena, sprinting hard toward another one-way street, which crosses the alley ahead. He doesn't know if he'll intercept the bike, but it's his only shot. 367   EXT. STREET                                                  367 Claudio GUNS the BIKE down the second street, parallel to Gordy's alley. He and Selena reach an intersection with the one-way street. A right turn will complete the \"U\" and take them back toward Gordy. Straight ahead, the street they're on is one-way in the opposite direction. Claudio hangs right and cranks on the speed. 123. 368   EXT. ALLEY                                                      368 Gordy's almost to the next street. He can hear the WHINE of the DUCATI growing closer. When... A truck stops ahead of him and blocks the alley. Gordy veers into a walkway between buildings. 369   EXT. STREET                                                     369 A parked   car suddenly pulls out in front of the speeding Ducati.    Claudio can't swerve around it. SLAMS ON the BRAKES.    The car's driver, frightened and flustered by the near   collision, is slow moving out of the way. 370   EXT. TOWN HOUSE - BACK YARD                                     370 Gordy bursts through a gate. Sees back steps leading to the open door of a second-story over a garage and charges the steps. 371   EXT. STREET                                                     371 The driver of the car finally backs up. Claudio aims the DUCATI through a narrow gap and ZOOMS on. 372   INT. TOWN HOUSE GARAGE                                          372 Gordy blows into the second story of the garage, a converted old-time carriage barn. He's in the old hayloft. On the opposite side of the loft, a double door built for loading in hay is open above the street. Gordy sprints for the opening, and... 373   EXT. STREET                                                     373 The Ducati tears around traffic, when... Gordy leaps out of the hayloft, launches himself off a parked car as the DUCATI SCREAMS past, and... He just manages to grab Selena and yank her off the bike. Selena's arms are wrapped around Claudio -- when Gordy rips her out of the saddle, Claudio goes, too. The three of them tumble to the ground as the speeding Ducati spins, flips and disintegrates. 124. 374   CLAUDIO                                                        374 in leathers and a helmet. He takes the fall better than Selena. Gets to his feet. Looks for the guns they dropped. Before Claudio can get to a gun, Gordy's on him. They grapple. Gordy pounds Claudio hard. Once. Twice. When... 375   SELENA                                                         375 side-kicks Gordy. He sags. She front-kicks a heel into his spine and between his shoulder blades. Gordy lets go of Claudio and drops. Selena's relentless, kicks Gordy repeatedly as... 376   CLAUDIO                                                        376 gets the pistol. Turns.   Aims the gun two-handed at Gordy's head, and BANG! 377   DRAY                                                           377 SHOOTS Claudio dead from the mouth of the alleyway down the block. The first SHOT CRACKS the back of Claudio's helmet. The second SHOT punches through and exits his visor in a bright red mist of blood. 378   SELENA                                                         378 bolts. 379   GORDY                                                          379 goes after her. 380   DRAY                                                           380 EMPTIES a CLIP at Selena, but he doesn't have a clear shot and misses. 381   SELENA                                                         381 sees a walkway between houses and turns in. 382   SAME SCENE - BEAT LATER                                        382 Gordy turns in behind her. 125. 383   EXT. WALKWAY                                                  383 Selena has ten yards on Gordy, but he's closing. She knows she can't outrun him in a straight line. Jukes through a gate into... 384   EXT. ANOTHER TOWN HOUSE - BACK YARD                           384 A shovel lies in the grass. Selena scoops it up and in one motion, spins back toward the gate, launches it blade-first with all her strength, timing it perfectly, as Gordy runs through the gate, and... 385   GORDY                                                         385 just barely evades the sharp shovel edge headed for his face. It doesn't hurt him, but it stops him, and Selena breaks toward an open door of the house. 386   INT. TOWN HOUSE - VARIOUS SHOTS                               386 Selena blasts into the bottom floor, runs through a playroom. Gordy's right behind her. 387   SELENA                                                        387 mounts a stairwell. A girl's descending. Selena grabs a pigtail and flings her down the stairs, and... 388   GORDY                                                         388 gets there just in time to keep the screaming girl from falling all the way to the bottom. He sits the uninjured girl down and continues on. 389   SELENA                                                        389 runs toward the living room, which is undergoing a renovation. Without stopping, she tears through the plastic covering the doorway to seal in dust from the rest of the house. She topples what she can into Gordy's way. Throws nails down behind her. Grabs a circular saw and hurls it back at Gordy, just missing him and shattering a large wall mirror. Selena's a soldier, taught to pick up and use whatever weapons she finds as she moves through a battlefield -- this battlefield gives her a crowbar, which she keeps as she runs out through plastic covering the other doorway. 126. 390    ARCHWAY                                                       390 leads into the dining room. Selena runs in. Gordy's right on her heels. Selena pulls down dining room chairs in front of Gordy. He vaults one but trips over the second and falls. 391    SELENA                                                        391 blows through a swinging door into the kitchen, slamming into a Hispanic maid, who's coming to investigate all the noise. Both women tumble. Selena gets right back on her feet. She breaks out a window with the crowbar and exits onto a fire escape as Gordy blasts in from the dining room. 392    OMITTED                                                       392 thru                                                                 thru 394                                                                  394 395    EXT. TOWN HOUSE - FIRE ESCAPE                                 395 The window Selena slipped through easily is small for Gordy. He gets hung up on the glass, losing precious seconds. Selena's already halfway up when Gordy hits the fire escape steps. The fire escape ends at a top floor window. Selena BREAKS out the GLASS with the crowbar and goes in. 396    INT. TOWN HOUSE - VARIOUS SHOTS                               396 Selena's in a teenager's bedroom. The teenager's got headphones on, oblivious to everything.

She's thinking ahead and she never hesitates. Her big problem is she's being pursued by an equally well-trained and determined firefighter. And he's not far back. One tumble, and he'll catch her. Selena strains harder. 404   SELENA                                                         404 vaults a gap.

Selena's ahead of him by a floor, hurrying down two rungs at a time. Gordy doesn't fuck with the rungs. Just swings over the edge of the roof, grabs the side-rails lightly with his hands, squeezes the rails with the insides of his boots and lets gravity take over. 406    EXT. EMBASSY - COURTYARD                                      406 The fire escape leads down to a second-story balcony running around the inside wall of the courtyard. Twin staircases lead from the balcony to ground level, where, across the slate-paved car court, a wrought-iron gate opens onto the street. Gordy hits the balcony a half-second after Selena. He grabs her. Selena swings the crowbar to break his arm. Gordy has to let go. Selena heads for the stairs leading to the ground. 407    GORDY'S                                                       407 got one chance to intercept Selena. The balcony's too high for him to jump, but the courtyard's ringed with trees -- they're not close, but they're not far, either. Not for a man craving revenge for the deaths of his wife and son, a man who also slides down fire poles for a living. Gordy runs down the balcony. Gains speed. Jumps. Launches off the balcony railing. And hurtles himself at the trunk of a medium-sized tree. He hits the trunk. Hangs on. And slides to the ground. And now... 408    ANOTHER ANGLE                                                 408 He's between Selena and the only way out.   And there's no way she's getting past him. But that's not what Selena's thinking. She attacks with the crowbar, and Gordy can only retreat in the face of the vicious onslaught. He finds a nearby garbage can. It's full, heavy, but he manages to lift it, spilling garbage as he uses the can to block the blows from the crowbar. The CROWBAR THWOCKS into the can over and over, the sound ECHOING LOUDLY in the small courtyard. Selena swings again, and Gordy moves to block the hit. It's a feint. She swings under the can and hits a leg. It hurts like hell, he stumbles, but he stays on his feet, still holding the can. Selena goes for his head. (CONTINUED) 129. 408   CONTINUED:                                                       408 Gordy raises the can. Thwock! Thwock! The can's all dents. There's garbage everywhere. She feints high and then swings low again, a wicked blow to the knee. Gordy stumbles badly this time. Selena breaks for the gate. Gordy sees her and, with all his might slings the can across the slate pavers, and... The can takes Selena's legs out from under her. She falls hard. Gets back to her feet quickly and starts to run, when... Gordy hits her like a linebacker. Slams Selena against a brick wall. Gets behind her and slips a mighty arm around her thin neck. Selena squirms hard, kicks backward, going for the balls, kneecaps, insteps, doing whatever she can to hurt Gordy and get free. But she's not in a position to do a lot of damage -- and she'd have to kill him before he'd let go. Gordy's got his arm locked in a police chokehold around Selena's neck. Uses his weight to force the smaller woman down onto her knees. Presses her harder, till she's sitting back on her legs. Selena can't drop out of the hold, and her legs are immobilized. All she can do is scratch. But Gordy's oblivious. They're alone in the courtyard. Body to body. Head to head. He's pumped with fury and hatred. He tightens the chokehold.
