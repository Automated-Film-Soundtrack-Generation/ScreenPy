For one, it's a Chrysler. Secondly, it has reinforced bumpers and racing tires. Driver's stopwatch shows four minutes now. He looks away from the Chrysler, gazing at the doors of the pawn shop, expecting Standard and Blanche to burst out at any moment. But there's no sign of them. The seconds tick away. Five minutes. Driver hesitates, all his instincts telling him to drive off, but he stays where he is, thinking of Irene.

Driver moves like lightning, grabbing the man's arms before he can get off another shot and pulling him through the window. The hitman lands heavily in a sea of broken glass, cutting his forehead open, blinded momentarily by the blood in his eyes. Driver takes his opportunity and slams the man's face back into the glass strewn floor, stunning him for a few more seconds as they struggle.

Tan Suit hears him and opens up again, more bullets lighting up the darkness. Driver keeps moving. Tan Suit strides after him, reloading, when suddenly his gun jams. Crouching behind another vehicle, Driver sees this and takes his chance, darting out after his pursuer. Tan Suit sees him coming and runs, the hunter becoming the hunted now. Still lying on the ground, Irene listens to their echoing footsteps. Driver runs after Tan Suit through the darkness, gaining all the time. Tan Suit looks desperate now, tiring. He turns to face his pursuer but Driver's on him in a flash, hurling him against a car. Tan Suit slams into the car, losing his balance. Driver grabs him, swinging him around, smashing him into another car. Irene's watching from the shadows, stunned by the violence. She picks herself up and runs towards the elevator. Driver keeps slamming Tan Suit against the car, beating the resistance out of him. As his body begins to slump, Driver grabs him by the throat and rams his head into a car window. The glass splinters with blood, the force of the blow shattering Tan Suit's skull. Driver looks around for Irene now and sees her standing in the elevator, framed against the light. She stares back at him, but makes no attempt to step out. Driver stands there, his hands covered in Tan Suit's blood. The elevator doors finally close, hiding Irene from view.",
