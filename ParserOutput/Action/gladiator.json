With a sudden roar he EXPLODES into action -- he swings past Juba and blocks the blow meant for Juba -- then he slashes the Andabata -- killing him -- he pulls Juba after him as he fights -- It is a dazzling display of Maximus' skill -- he moves through the Andabatae at amazing speed -- spinning around Juba and protecting him -- slashing ruthlessly -- pulling Juba after him and commanding the battle -- Juba recovers a sword and they fight together.

Spaniard!  Spaniard!\" We stay with Maximus as he cuts through the four Celts like a scythe through wheat and then we dramatically pull up and away -- Taking in the roaring arena and the hero. EXT.

At this point we see practically nothing of the inside of the Colosseum: Slaves are balancing high above the empty arena.  They are on ropes unrolling huge rolls of muslin; sun tarps that provide shade below... Merchants open stalls in the curved arcade around outside of the Colosseum.  They sell everything from food to magic elixirs, from toys to aphrodisiacs.  They immediately start declaiming and demonstrating the virtues of their products... Gangs of whores of both sexes trawl the streets.  They have bizarrely-colored hair and elaborate makeup... Citizens begin arriving, pushing past the vendors and the pickpockets.  We see whole families with picnic lunches... Ferocious animals are brought into the Colosseum in barred cages... In the busy arcade, barbers and blood-letters practice their craft alongside exotic alchemists, fire eaters and contortionists... Richer citizens arrive in sedan chairs and chariots, they feign indifference to the hooting mob... Mounted City Guard police units try to retain some order... Gamblers crowd betting booths and haggle mercilessly... Finally, we see Maximus and the other gladiators in a slave cart.  Maximus watches everything as the slave cart disappears into the Colosseum... INT.  COLOSSEUM - ROUTE TO HOLDING CELLS - DAY The interior of the Colosseum is a busy world unto itself. Maximus and the others are lead by Proximo's guards down a long ramp and past countless animal cages.  Gamblers circulate everywhere and observe the warriors, angling for the best odds and the best matches. Maximus and the others are led even deeper into the bowels of the Colosseum to a new whole subterranean realm. Numerous cells line the walls.  Racks and racks of weaponry and armor. And, most striking, everywhere around them is the heavy machinery of the spectacles above.  Huge \"elevator\" platforms and ramps and pulleys and counterweights are manned by teams of sweating slaves. INT.  COLOSSEUM - HOLDING CELLS - DAY Finally, Proximo's guards lead the gladiators to their holding cells.  These cells are right at the edge of the arena.  Barred windows offer a sand-level view of the action. Maximus immediately goes to a window and looks out. He cannot see much of the entire arena, but what he does see transfixes him. A band of Christians are huddled together.  An eerie silence from the Colosseum but for the prayers of the Christians. Maximus watches them.  One little girl peels past her mother's arm.  She sees Maximus.  She smiles. Suddenly a dozen ferocious lions race up a ramp by Maximus -- they roar into the arena -- We do not see the carnage.  We watch Maximus' face as we hear the sounds of the slaughter. And the sound of the roaring crowd. Maximus finally cannot watch.  He drops his head. INT.  COLOSSEUM - TRAINER'S LAIR - DAY Proximo is with a dozen other gladiator trainers and the Colosseum's orator and majordomo, CASSIUS.  They are haggling in an secluded area not far from the arena itself.  Huge chalkboards chart the day's matches and wagers and odds. Colosseum touts continually erase and mark new figures on the chalkboards to keep up with the swiftly changing bouts. The roar of the lions and the unnerving screams of the Christians can clearly be heard.",

THE LEGIONNAIRES OF SCIPIO AFRICANUS!! The crowd EXPLODES in cheers as the huge doors at one end of the arena suddenly burst open and ten chariots thunder in -- Each chariot has a driver and an archer, both dressed in theatrical versions of the familiar Roman Lorica Segmentata. A chaos of dust -- and the battle is on -- The chariots zoom around the arena -- the archers keeping up a deadly hail of arrows. Maximus immediately dives onto a passing chariot and kills the charioteer and archer -- he dramatically leaps from the front of the chariot to a lead horse and cuts it free. And Maximus takes control, we see the General of the Felix Regiment gloriously alive again as he barks out orders and leads his gladiators in battle.  They follow him faithfully, his stern commands unquestioned. His strategies are quick and smart, he makes the gladiators work together. This kind of slaughter could last for hours... We see flashes of the endless battle... Maximus races on his horse past another chariot, kills the driver, the chariot smashes into a wall... the sun sinks lower, the shadows on the sand lengthen... areas of the sand are swamps of blood, Juba slips, pulls himself up fighting... Maximus uses Vibius to create a diversion, two chariots collide... the crowd roars... a gladiator is dragged between a chariot and the side wall of the arena... the drummers pound out their relentless tattoo... Finally... Maximus is on his horse across from the final chariot. We can see that Juba and Vibius and a few other gladiators are still alive.  The rest of the arena is polluted with the dead and injured. Maximus spurs his horse and gallops toward the final chariot -- the charioteer whips his horses and zooms toward Maximus -- The crowd is breathless -- watching the final battle -- Maximus and the chariot speed toward each other -- like Medieval jousters -- And collide in a flashing explosion of steel -- Maximus sails from his horse -- as the charioteer sails from his chariot -- Maximus lands hard but quickly pulls himself up, he races to the final charioteer.  The charioteer is defeated but not dead. Maximus glances around, all his opponents are defeated. He stands over the final charioteer.  Then he simply tosses down his sword. The crowd is stunned by this strange act of mercy.  But then an enormous roar grows from the crowd -- wave after wave of adulation for the hero of the day. Maximus looks around, taking it all in. Then he turns to the Imperial Box. Maximus slowly walks to before the the Imperial Box.  The Praetorian Archers immediately raise their bows, pointing down at him. Maximus glares up at Commodus through his helmet mask. Commodus returns his gaze, curious. The crowd is intrigued, growing quiet.  What is going on? Then Maximus simply turns and begins walking away.",

The crowd cheers and Maximus immediately turns and starts slashing -- Tiger easily blocks and strikes back -- The sword play is very fast -- they block and parry and hack like lightning -- constantly attacking -- they are perfectly matched -- As he fights Maximus becomes aware of a strange sound over the roar of the crowd -- a low rumbling -- then he feels something -- a vibration in the ground -- Suddenly traps doors swing open and four enormous platforms rise into view.  On each platform is a snarling Bengal tiger restrained by a chain.  Tiger's teams of \"cornermen\" hold the chains through a pulley system.  The cornermen are safely inside cages.  The platforms stop at ground level. The four ferocious tigers now mark the four corners of the battleground. Tiger takes advantage of Maximus' momentary confusion and assaults brutally -- forcing him back toward one of the tigers -- the tiger claws for Maximus -- Maximus just evades it claws -- rolls for a new position -- another tiger snaps at him -- Tiger attacks -- Maximus is on the defensive -- fighting off Tiger and evading the four snarling beasts -- And then all four tigers are suddenly closer.  The teams of cornermen are letting the chains play out, bit by bit, gradually reducing the size of the battle ground.  The crowd roars. But the fight is hardly fair. Whenever Tiger is near one of the tigers the cornermen pull back the tiger slightly -- when Maximus is near a tiger they let it out a bit. Maximus and Tiger fight -- swirling action -- finally, Maximus has the edge -- he circles so that the sun stabs into Tiger's eyes -- then Maximus lunges forward under Tiger's swinging sword and SLAMS into him -- they fall -- a tiger swats at Maximus' face -- he jerks his head back -- he shoots out a leg and kicks Tiger's sword toward one of the tigers -- it is out of reach -- Maximus leaps up and stands over the winded Tiger, sword to his throat. Tiger is gasping for breath, crushed. Then one of Tiger's corners suddenly cheats -- they completely release a tiger -- it leaps for Maximus -- Maximus barely has time to turn -- the tiger crashes into him -- its claws slashing into his back, cutting through his leather armor -- Maximus shoves an armored forearm into the tiger's jaws and stabs with his sword -- Tiger takes this chance to pull himself up -- one of his corners throws him another sword -- the crowd boos -- Maximus wrestles with the tiger -- spinning it around with superhuman effort so it is always between himself and Tiger -- so that Tiger can't get at him -- Maximus finally kills the tiger and leaps for Tiger -- he quickly disarms him and tosses him to the ground -- Maximus stands over him -- ready to administer the coup de grace. All eyes turn to the Emperor. Commodus slowly stands and steps to the edge of the Imperial Box.  He raises his arm and gives the fatal thumbs down. Maximus looks up at him. And then defiantly tosses the sword to the ground, refusing to kill Tiger. Commodus is stunned. The crowd gasps -- a collective intake of breath -- and then an enormous roar building.  It cascades around the Colosseum.  It is a roaring celebration of the unexpected act of mercy.  And the delicious act of defiance of the Emperor. Commodus slowly sits. Maximus walks across the arena -- the people stand and cheer for him.  Cries of \"Maximus the Merciful\" can be heard. It is the birth of a hero. INT.  COLOSSEUM - HOLDING CELLS - DAY Maximus is resting in his cell after the battle, head down, deep in thought.",

The waste and offal are shoveled into a large sewer opening.  A butcher occasionally lifts a sluice-gate and a gush of water flows into the sewer from above, washing down the blood and carcasses. Maximus crouches and creeps through the nightmare of hanging carcasses and flies. When the butchers are looking elsewhere, Maximus creeps to the sewer opening and climbs in -- he immediately slides down for a few yards in the slanting, slippery blood sluice -- out of sight -- Then he thuds to a stop.  He can go no further because the remains of an animal carcass blocks his way.  He tries to slither past the carcass -- Finally, one of the butchers above lifts the sluice-gate and a torrent of water flows down. Maximus is washed down the hideous sewer. INT.  TUNNELS - NIGHT Proximo and Juba are quickly marching back down the tunnel toward the compound -- they are very close now -- the roar of flame is heard -- the creak of falling timber -- and the screams of burning men.  They run. They round a corner and see there is no way past the world of flame ahead of them.  The tunnel to the compound has collapsed.",

GAIUS' BEDROOM:  Gaius and his wife are yanked awake and hauled out. CHRISTIAN HOME:  A congregation of Christians is chained together, their secret altar smashed. CAFE:  Greek Scholars are hauled away from their scrolls. STREET THEATER:  Actors are dragged off in the midst of a performance. GRACCHUS' STEAM ROOM:  Gracchus is enjoying grapes with his handsome catamite.  A unit of Praetorian bursts in. Gracchus looks at them.  Sighs. INT.

TIBER RIVER - NIGHT Maximus splashes to the surface of the filthy Tiber, gasping for air. Animal carcasses float up next to him.  He grabs onto one and floats down the gently flowing river. EXT.  ITALIAN FRONT - CAMP - DAWN The Wolf of Rome sleeps.  Then its ears rise.  Then its head.  It sniffs the air.  The wolf slowly rises and begins loping through the camp. It passes slumbering soldiers and tents, smoke lazily drifting up from campfires. The wolf finally stops and looks up. Maximus is on a horse.  He climbs down.  The wolf goes to him and licks his hand. Maximus begins marching through the camp, the wolf at his side.  Soldiers stir, amazed to see their General is alive. Gallus leaps up, stunned, and goes to Maximus.  They continue to march through the camp, more and more astonished soldiers joining them. They march toward the large tents at the center of the encampment. Titus emerges from his tent.  Slams to a stop -- TITUS By all the Gods... He goes to Maximus and embraces him.",

PALACE - COMMODUS' BEDROOM - MORNING A castrati choir sings a gentle hymn of celebration. Their eerie voices and otherworldly harmonies undulate around Commodus' bedroom. The Emperor himself is in a chair, wrapped in a robe.  His body slaves work over him closely. He is staring into a mirror, lost in another world as the slaves carefully apply golden eye makeup to him. The castrati hymn continues... EXT.  OUTSIDE THE COLOSSEUM - DAY The hymn is all we hear as we see crowds moving into the Colosseum... It seems that all of Rome is here for this great day. Huge throngs of citizens move like a massive wave toward the Colosseum entrances.  Vendors are doing brisk business.  Praetorian units in full dress uniform canter past. We elegantly float up along the outer tiers of the Colosseum and then glide over the edge to see the arena stands... EXT.  COLOSSEUM - DAY The hymn is all we hear as we see... The stands are filling.  We see the rich and poor alike. We see the orator Cassius.  We see Senator Falco and most of the Senate.  We see the cohort of fifty Praetorian taking up position around the Imperial Box. A golden platform, with stairs down to the arena sand, now extends about twenty feet from the Imperial Box to a spot over the arena. We float down the stairs and then we see the arena itself... It is stunning in its simplicity. The days victims are tied to posts in the center of the arena.  Suspended above them is an enormous cloud.  A thick, tumescent bladder painted to look like a threatening rain cloud. We see Proximo and Juba.  We see Senators Gracchus and Gaius.  We see Gaius' wife and Gracchus catamite and Christian families and scholars and actors. Seven stylized hills surround them. The hymn comes to its soaring conclusion as we see the damned. TIME CUT: Later.  By now, the Colosseum is packed.  All fifty-five thousand seats are taken.  Another ten thousand stand wherever they can.  A feral anticipation buzzes through the crowd. Outside the Colosseum, the streets are crowded with thousands more who couldn't get in. Trumpets blare. Commodus' six Centurion Body Guards stride into the Imperial Box. Then Commodus enters.  He is shrouded in a full lion's skin, the head of the lion concealing his own.  His head is down, he does not look up. Lucilla and Lucius enter after him and sit.  Lucilla's face is drained, her eyes defeated.  Lucius is wearing a miniature set of Lorica Segmentata, complete with ceremonial dagger. EXT.  ROMAN STREET - DAY A mangy dog is slowly crossing a dusty street on the outskirts of Rome.  The street is deserted.  It seems that almost everyone is at the Colosseum. The dog stops.  Looks up. Then a sound is heard.  The steady cadence of horses' hooves. The Felix Regiment rounds a corner.  Maximus leads the cavalry.  He wears Lorica Segmentata.  His corps of archers and soldiers follow.  They troop down the dusty street. Maximus and the cavalry canter past the mystified dog. QUICK CUTS: The Felix Regiment moves through the streets.  The few pedestrians quickly disappear into shops and around corners.  The roar of the Colosseum can be heard far in the distance... Arrows slice into isolated Praetorian sentries.  The Felix Regiment continues its stealth invasion... Finally, Maximus reins his horse and his troops stop. The mounted City Guard are waiting. Without a word, the City Guard joins Maximus and the two combined forces continue their inexorable march to the Colosseum. EXT.  COLOSSEUM - DAY Commodus, still swathed in the lion skin, his head down, slowly walks out on the platform that now extends from the Imperial Box. The crowd grows hushed. Commodus reaches the end of the platform and waits for a moment.  Then he dramatically flings off the lion skin. The crowd gasps. He is almost naked, his entire chiseled body is painted in gold.  His eyes are lost in an eerie reverie as he looks around at his people. He finally speaks:",

OUTSIDE COLOSSEUM - DAY The roar from the Colosseum is now deafening as Maximus and the City Guard round the final corner -- the Colosseum is before them -- the massive Praetorian Guard force is caught of guard -- with crisp military efficiency the Felix Regiment and the City Guard quickly canter into place, an unbroken line of seasoned warriors facing the Praetorians. The huge mob outside the Colosseum is confused, intrigued, watching the face-off.  The mounted archers of the Felix Regiment have drawn their bows. Maximus looks down from his horse at a Praetorian Officer.",
