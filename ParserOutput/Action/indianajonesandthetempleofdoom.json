A Chinese GONG SOUNDS and the glittering doors of an art Deco pa- poda slide open to reveal a mammoth silver stairway down which rows of beautiful women start descending   (BEGIN MAIN TITLES) The lovely ladies are a mix of races and they sing a strange, haunting melody -- one might think them a heavenly choir, if it weren't for their sexy, clinging lame gowns. 2.     INT.  CLUB ENTRANCE                                             2. From the ethereal beauties, we cut to a street urchin's dirty face: SHORT ROUND is a ten-year-old Chinese kis wearing a beat- up American baseball cap. Sneaking into the club, Short Round weaves past the fancy gowns and silk suits, heading toward the music in the main ballroom. 3.     INT.  THE BALLROOM                                              3. Short Round enters and stares across the smoky nightclub.  On the stage, he sees a giant paper-mache dragon laying curled around the pagoda. Now, the dragon's eyes light up, its nostrils exhale smoke and its enormous jaws open.  Out of the dragon's mouth walks the star of the stage show: WILLIE SCOTT, a dreamy beauty singing a sultry solo white the or- chestra wails the accompaniment. But Short Round's not here to ogle crooning dames.  He surveys the rich Chinese, American and European revelers.  Jewels flash and champagne flows.  Short Round finally spots a table of somber-looking Chinese men in suits. Short Round chews gum and stares at the men.  Then he turns to go.  WU HAN, a waiter with a scar across his cheek, watches Short Round leave. 4.     INT.  CLUB ENTRANCE                                            4. As Short Round hurries toward the exit, he bumps into a man in a tuxedo entering the club.  Short Round looks up at the man, but we don't see his face. Then Short Round is grabbed by the scruff of his neck and a door- man hustles him out the door, Short Round yelling insults all the way. A maitre d' apologizes to the man in the tuxedo and two hat-check girls smile at him familiarly as he continues into the ballroom. We notice something incongruous:  the man in the tuxedo is wear- ing work boots caked with mud. 5.     INT.  THE BALLROOM                                             5. The man in the tuxedo stops to watch Willie Scott singing sexily on the stage.  Then he looks around and sees the table of somber Chinese men that Short Round spotted earlier. As the man in the tuxedo walks toward the table, he removes a cigarette from a silver case.  He arrives at the table just as the chorus and orchestra reach a crescendo -- And on the stage, a glistening, muscular slave swings a huge ham- mer toward an enormous brass gong -- The man in the tuxedo leans to receive a light from a cigarette- girl and, as the GONG BOOMS, the match flares to reveal his face for the first time: It's INDIANA JONES.  Elegant in a tuxedo -- dressed to kill.  The TITLES END and over this a legend appears on the screen:",

As the gunmen open fire, Indy springs onto a chair -- jumps onto a table -- and leaps onto the stage.  He grabs the golden broad- sword from the Chinese warrior statue! As bullets smash into the statue, Indiana hides behind it.  Then he jumps out and swings the large sword toward the enormous brass gong. The crimson cord holding the gong is SLASHED!  Indy slings the sword at his assailants and gives the three-meter-high gong a helpful shove -- The giant gong rolls and echoes as it crashes down the marble steps.  Indiana ducks behind it as it gains momentum and rolls across the dance floor. Using the gong as an enormous shield, Indy evades the gunfire ex- ploding -- bullets ricochet off the rolling brass gong as Indy runs behind it. Ahead, Willie hurries toward an exit -- she hears something and turns -- her eyes go wide as she sees the mammoth gong bearing down on her! Willie yells as Indiana grabs her arm and pulls her behind the gong with him -- Lao watches amazed as he and his gunmen dodge tables trying to get better firing positions -- and more henchmen come into the club now and start firing machine guns! As bullets clang against the gong, Indiana and Willie run behind it.  Willie hollers as they head directly for a towering, floor- to-ceiling window! Indiana grabs Willie around the waist and, after the huge gong crashes through the stained-glass window, they both fly after it! 6.

Indiana Jones and Wil- lie Scott hurtle into the night air after it! The gong rolls down the roof and they hit the tiles behind it, Indiana holding onto Willie as they roll one-over-the-other toward the edge -- Willie screams as they fall into thin air! Their entwined bodies plummet three stories:  ripping through a third-floor awning, crashing through an old man's mattress on a second-floor balcony -- Finally they smash through the convertible top of a parked Duesen- berg and fall into the back seat! 7.

As the smoking DC-3 screams out of control toward the mountain, skimming the rocky snow-covered slopes, we see the lift raft spilling out the open door -- The raft pops into its full shape, acting now as a spoiler, soar- ing against the rushing wind and finally crashing and bouncing against the snowy mountainside. In the distance, we see the DC-3 finally kiss the earth and ex- plode in a cloud of flame against a rocky escarpment -- metal and earth mushrooming in a million directions! 32.    EXT.  THE MOUNTAINSIDE                                         32. As the raft rockets down the snow, Indiana clutches the front and Willie and Short Round hold on for dear life on either side of him. The raft plummets down the mountain, crossing the timber-line and entering a forest.  Bouncing over a snow-hidden log, the raft shoots directly for a tree -- Indiana pulls on the perimeter rope, rolls on his side and man- ages to swerve the raft so it caroms offthe snow-drifted side of the tree trunk. Continuing its downhill run, the raft smashes across a small steam, sending silvery water spraying. As the raft skids below the snow-level, it starts bouncing over rocky ground and its three passengers' teeth start chattering. 33.    EXT.  A BLUFF                                                  33. The yellow raft crashes through a tangle of bushes and then plum- mets toward a bluff!  The raft goes airborne over a small bluff and lands with a splash in a slow-moving river. 34.    EXT.  THE RIVER                                                34.

EXT.  WHITE WATER RAPIDS                                       35. The raft is heading directly toward a surging stretch of treach- erous rapids.  Indiana looks less cocky as he and Willie and Short Round hold on again for dear life! The raft plunges into the roaring torrent, bouncing over rock- swollen waves, twisting and spinning through narrow gaps.  The three helpless passengers are drenched in the thundering cascades of white water. Willie is hallering, Short Round hangs on wide-eyed and even Indy looks terrified as the raft crashes down the rapids.  Finally, after one heart-stopping bounce, the raft seems to slow. 36.    EXT.  RIVER CLEARING                                           36. The raft drifts out of the main part of the river and glides to- ward a clearing.  Its three soaked and bedraggled passengers lie motionless in the bottom. Indy's hand drags alongside the raft, his fingers leaving a trail in the almost still water.  Battered and exhausted, but always Indy's \"bodyguard\", Shorty looks over at him worriedly -- SHORT ROUND Indy?",

Indiana, Short Round and Willie exit the spike chamber and head down a larger tunnel through which a roaring wind intermittantly blows, howling eerily like a note of gloomy music. Indiana follows a curve in the tunnel and they see light approaching. The wind holws another dramatic note which gales past them as they reach the mouth of the tunnel. Indiana is joined by Willie and Short Round.  They all stop in astonishment at the sight below them: 95.    INT.  THE TEMPLE OF DEATH                                      95. As the camera pulls back,  the mouth of the wind tunnel in which they are standing becomes just a small hole overlooking the stag- gering vastness of the incredible TEMPLE OF DEATH. The colossal subterranean temple has been carved out of a solid mass of rock.  A vaulting cathedral-like ceiling is supported by rows of carved stone columns. Balconies overlook the temple floor.  Pillared halls leading to dark side chambers.  Moving out of these chambers, hundreds of faithful worshippers chant as they enter the temple. Mammoth stone statues of elephants, lions and demi-gods (half/man, half/animal monstrosities) loom above the swelling crowds or wor- shippers. As the wind howls out of the tunnel high above the temple, the worshippers chant in response to the strange tunnel music. 96.    INT.  THE TUNNEL                                               96. The moaning wind rushes past Indiana, Willie and Short Round as they watch the mystery cult below bowing toward an enormous altar at the far end of the temple. This altar is a platform jutting out from the stone wall of the cavern.  Separating the worshippers from this altar is a wide crevasse out of which wisps of smoke rise occasionally. 97.    INT.  THE ALTAR                                                97. On the other side of the crevasse, evil-looking priests materialize out of clouds of swirling smoke.  The priests carry smoke-billowing urns to a giant stone statue. Now, we see the hideous protectress of the temple, the obscenely malevolent ombect of the cult's devotion:  the bloodthirsty god- dess KALI! The red-eyed priests bow at the base of the statue and gaze reverently at their KALI MA.  Skulls surround her stone feet carved serpents twist up her legs, while around her waist there is a guresome belt of human hands. Naked to the hips, Kali's hair falls about her four arms.  In her hand, she holds a sword, in the second the severed head of a giant.With her other hands she encourages her worshipers, who are chanting louder and louder! Kali's face is loathsome:  her earrings are two corpses.  Her evil tongue extends out of her twisted mouth and what looks like read blood flows over her long fangs and down her naked breasts. 98.

Here is a man who looks as vile and diabolic as the unholy goddess rising behind him. Up in the wind tunnel, Indy stares down at the High Priest and realizes that is was Mola Ram he saw conferring with Chattar Lal in the palace garden. As the drum booms three times more, Mola Ram lifts one arm up from his emaciated body and suddenly there is a scream!

Indy lands on his feet and turns to release the whip.  Short Round waves to Indy that the coast is clear.  Indy snaps the whip -- it releases from the elephant tusk and drops. Recurling the whip, Indy attaches it to his belt and moves to- ward the towering statue of Kali.  The three Sankara stones start to glow and Indiana approaches them cautiously. Reaching the stones, Indy's face is lighted by them.  He notices that one of them (sthe stone from Mayapore village) has strange lines painted across it. Suspiciously, Indy touches the stone, but it doesn't burn.  He lifts it carefully and peers into it.  The enormous diamond sparkles inside.  He places the stone in his shoulder bag and reaches for the others. 117.   INT.  THE WIND TUNNEL                                          117.

The only il- lumination is the back-light streaming around the silhouetted statue of Kali. Indy slowly crosses a narrow stone bridge and moves toward a cy- lindrical shaft of light rising up from what appears to be an enormous hole. Indy hears voices and the clink of metal against rock as he con- tinues forward.  The ground is dark in front of the large hole. He edges toward the precipice and the light rising up illuminates the look of shock on his face as he peers down into Hell... 121.   INT.

Crawling out of these burrows, scrawny children drag sacks of dirt and rock.  Other hollow-eyed children pull these sacks to mine cars waiting on rails. Straining to lift the rocks into the mine cars, several of the children slip and fall.  Bare-chested Thuggee guards shout at the enslaves children and kick those who've fallen. For these children there would seem to be only one hope -- death -- an end to their travail. Indiana edges around the hole, looking into the ghastly mine and feeling as if he's discovered an inferno of misery as grotesque as Dante's. Indy shifts the bag of stones on his shoulder.  He hesitates and considers his choice:  he has the Sankara Stones and can leave with them now... But Indy hears the pleading cries of one child and peers down to see a burly Thuggee guard beating the pitiful little slave.  Indy gets angrier and angrier as he watches. He finally steps over the grabs a boulder.  He lifts it and flings it down into the mine -- 122.   INT.  THE MINE                                                 122.

Indy's smile seems to fade as his anger turns to surprise as he feels something unnerving: Dirt is crumbling away from the rim of the hole, a small landslide starting beneath his feet.

The moaning guard looks at Shorty thankfully and then looks around as if waking from a nightmare -- SHORT ROUND (to another slave kid) His eyes -- they go out. Other guards appear and lift the guard -- suddenly he starts struggling against the guards not wanting to return to the night- mare of Kali -- FAT GUARD (as he's dragged away) No!  NO!",

Short Round races up a tunnel and then flattens himself behind a corner.  He peers anxiously into a large carven and sees two guards walking away. When the coast is clear, Short Round darts across the cavern to a long wooden ladder tilted up against a wall.  Short Round looks up the high ladder and sees a kid with a sack of rocks descending from a burrow-hole half-way up the wall. The exhausted kid nearly collapses at the bottom -- then jumps seeing Short Round.  Shorty motions for him to keep quiet. Amaxed, the kid watches Short Round scramble up the ladder. Shorty continues until he is high above the floor. Dirty faces stare out of the high burrow as Short Round stops climbing.  The kids are astonished as Short Round suddenly grunts and kicks the ladder away from the wall! The high ladder falls in an arc and what seem like sure suicide slowly resembles a mini-Indiana Junes stunt as Short Round swings to the other side of the falling ladder -- Short Round holds on for dear life as the ladder crashes against the opposite cavern wall -- giving Short Round access to the roof-hole that leads up to the temple!

Seeing him coming, Indy's eyes start glowing yellow and when Short Round runs up to him, Indiana suddenly swings and backhands the little guy brutally across the face! The torch flies out of Shorty's hand as he's knocked against at wall by Indy's vicious blow -- Short Round wipes a little blood from his chin and stares at his hero in wounded disbelief. Chattar Lal watches approvingly -- a priest moves toward Shorty. Chattar Lal looks back toward the crevasse -- Willie hangs on the lowering frame, heat waves rising up now to scald her skin and she chokes as the sulphuric air burns her lungs! Meanwhile Short Round is crawling backwards across the floor with a look of terror on his face -- Indiana stalks him, hissing, snarling, his eyes lgowing -- Short Round springs to his feet and tries to run -- Indy grabs him and pulls him -- Shorty's hand grabs for another wall torch and just manages to yank it free! Indiana spins Short Round and clutches his throat.  As Indy strangles him, Short Round struggles and finally jams the torch into Indy's side.

Meanwhile, up on a catwalk, a guard slices a sword through the air and Indiana ducks!  The sword slashes into a wooden railing and the guard tries frantically to pull it out -- Indiana slams kis knee up into the guard's stomach and then smashes his fist down on his neck -- the man collapses.  Indy hears more gunfire. Indiana rushes along the catwalk toward the platform above.  He edges against the wall below the platform, staying out of sight as he unfurls his whip.

Willie ducks low, watching the heavy beams flashing danger- ously close above their heads. Then Willie's eyes go wide and she groans in terror like a girl on a roller coaster as the mine car suddenly plunges downward, taking their stomachs with it.

Indiana isn't sure and he pulls Willie by the arm and all three of them start jogging. The rumbling behind them sounds increasingly ominous and finally they start running full tilt.

Meanwhile, Indiana is scaling the cliff face to get over the water geyser to the other side.  He grabs at scrub brush and finds a few perilous footholds as he makes his way to the bridge. 172.   EXT.  THE ROPE BRIDGE                                          172. Willie and Short Round pull themselves up at the end of the bridge.  Behind them a dark tunnel runs back into the mines. What's in front of them is hardly more reassuring -- The rope bridge across the gorge is a century old and defintely wasn't built by army engineers.  Laying across the two bottom rope-spans, worm-eaten and moldy boards offer risky footings. Vertical side ropes connect the bottom rope-spans to the two up- per ropes that constitute the dangerous hand-railings. Short Round steps tentatively out onto the bridge.  It holds him and he turns and smiles at Willie -- SHORT ROUND Easy like pie!  Kid's stuff! Suddenly the board under him breaks! Willie grabs Short Round before he falls into the abyss!  Looking pale and less cocky, Short Round starts out again and Willie follows his carefully. They continue stepping across the bridge cautiously, a feat made more difficult by the bridge's constant swaying and the hear- stopping up and down movement. Behind them, Indy finally pulls himself up from under the bridge. He stands up and sees Willie and Short Round halfway across already.  Then he hears something and turns quickly -- he takes his whip out and ducks to the side of the tunnel as two Thuggee guards rush out. Indy cracks the whip, catching the first guard around the neck -- the guard spills forward and trips the second guard.  The first man tries to stand but Indiana kicks him in the head. The second guard gets to his feet and seings his sword -- Indy ducks, slams him in the stomach and dives for the first guard's sword.  He grabs it and rolls aside quickly as the second gaurd attempts to slice him in two! Indy gets to his feet and immediately finds himself about to en- gage in a sword duel with the enraged Thuggee guard.  Indy looks at the unfamiliar sword, hefts it, and tries to quickly decide the best way to use it -- Suddenly the guard shouts and charges.  Indy decides shouting must be the \"de rigueur\" technique and shouts back loudly -- the two swords CLANG and spark as the duel erupts. Indy flails and feints and the Thuggee guard lunges and slashes. Indy finally gains the upper hand and dispatches the Thuggee guard who slumps defeated into the dirt. Keeping the sword, Indy starts out onto the bridge, walking as quickly as possible across the rickety span.  He hears shouting ahead and looks worried then temple guards appear at the far end of the bridge. The guards suprise Willie and Shorty as they finally get across the bridge.  Struggling   futilely with the guards, Willie shouts at Indiana -- WILLIE Indy -- looks out behind you! Indy sees more Thuggee guards rushing out of the tunnel behind him.  He turns and sees two of the tmeple guards who captured Willie and Short Round coming across the bridge in front of him. Indy stands helpless in the middle of the swaying bridge with guards approaching from both sides, and nothing but heaven above and the rocky gorge hundreds of feet below! A wind comes up and the High Priest, Mola Ram, appears on the far end of the bridge.  He stands with the guards who hold Willie and Short Round. The wind whips around Indy and he staggers unsteadily on the swaying bridge as he watches Mola Ram -- INDIANA Let my friends go! Mola Ram shouts in Hindi and the guards start to move toward Indy from both sides of the bridge.",

It breaks in the middle and both halves fall apart!  The guards scream horribly in the air as they plunge down into the rocky gorge! Willie and Short Round cling to their established footholds and fall with the bridge toward the wall of the gorge.  Mola Ram spills forward, clutching desperately at the ropes and slats -- Below them, Indiana has latched onto a rope and swings with the bridge as it hits the gorge wall and hangs vertically now, dang- ling from its moorings at the top. There's an instant of suspended animation as all who remain alive realize they are alive.  Short Round and Willie cling near the top of the now vertical bridge. Below them, Mola Ram clutches onto one of the main ropes while directly above him the last of his guards holds on for dear life. Short Round and Willie struggle upwards, clutching ropes and stepping on slats.  Finally, Short Round heaves himself up onto solid ground and turns to help Willie up. Meanwhile, dangling below on the bridge, Indy reaches up and grabs Mola Ram's leg.  The High Priest kicks and tries to break Indy's grip.  He kicks again and smashes Indy in the face. Indy won't let go.  Suddenly the High Priest reaches up and grabs his own Thuggee guard and yanks his down by the front of his shirt -- Mola Ram shoves the luckless guard down onto Indy, trying to dislodge him by sacrificing the screaming Thuggee.  Indy manages to hang on.  The Thuggee is less fortunate and falls screaming to his death. Then Mola Ram looks across the gorge and yells.  Indy sees a dozen of the last Thuggee guards streaming out of the tunnel -- only to be stranded on the far side of the now bridgeless gorge. Indy starts climbing up after Mola Ram again.  He grabs at the back of Mola Ram's robe and pull him down.  Slipping, Mola Ram turns and it's Indy's chance to punch Mola Ram in the face. Mola Ram's eyes are glowing yellow and he's shouting incoherent- ly.  He grabs the strap of Indy's shoulder bag and stamps on In- dy's hand -- Indy falls! Indiana slips downward, scrambling to catch hols of something -- meanwhile, Mola Ram now has the bag with the Sankara Stones. Indy finally stops his downward slide and dangles dangerously near the bottom of the bridge. Across the gorge, the Thuggee guards run up a path to a small gove of trees growing on a plateau above the gorge.  The guards have bows and arrows and take firing positions -- At the top of the bridge, Mola Ram keeps climbing until rocks start poundinghim from above -- Willie and Short Round pely him with rocks which he tries to block with his arm. Indiana starts to climb again, using all his strength.  He reaches for a wooden slat -- suddenly a flaming arrow smashes into the wood! Indy turns in amazement and sees more flaming arrows rocketing across the chasm directy for him! Across the gorge, by the grove of trees, a Thuggee priest yells orders to the archers who continue to launch the flaming arrows. Indiana crawls up as the bridge starts to burn from the continu- ing bursts of fiery arrows.  At the top, Mola Ram reaches up des- perately for a hand old -- Willie smashes his hand with a rock! The High Priest yells in pain and slips down to where Indy slugs him again in the face!  They struggle as the fire burns up from beneath them. On the cliff above the fallen bridge, Willie watches the fire rising toward Indy and Mola Ram as they fight.  Short Round turns and sees something -- SHORT ROUND Willie, look! They see horses galloping through a narrow pass -- the British cavalry is returning.  Captain Blumburtt and the first troops draw up their forses and dismount quickly. A fussilade of flaming arrows force the British to take cover -- they quickly start firing back at the Thuggees with rifles. As the battle above the gorge continues, Indy and Mola Ram fight below on the dangling bridge -- Indiana sees the High Priest's eyes begin glowing and he hisses insanely.  Mola Ram's hand thrusts out toward Indiana's chest and Indy yells in pain -- Indy looks down and writhes terrified as he sees Mola Ram's hand starting to enter his chest (as it entered the victim's chest during the temple sacrifice)! Mola Ram's finger are inching into Indy's body --  Indy clutches at Mola Ram's piercing hand, trying to keep the deadly fingers away from his heart. Slowly, Indy is able to push Mola Ram's hand away and his fingers withdraw from Indy's chest.  Indiana suddenly slugs the High Priest in the face and grabs for the bag of Sankara Stones -- MOLA RAM No, the stones are mine!",
