In front  of the trucks is a sandbag  wall manned by soldiers. The trucks are flanked by police cars. And if  one looks closely enough, they  can see a pair  of AGENTS standing to  the side. THE stunned soldiers have time to fire off a couple shots as they  run frantically to get  out of the  way of the  bike, 800 pounds  of metal flying at 150 miles per hour. GREGORY  plows  into the  sandbag  wall, directly  between  two parked trucks. The wall parts in  an explosion of sand and  sandbags. THEYRE THROUGH, but the bike scissors  uncontrollably, until it rolls and  we drop into bullet-time. AS the bike goes  over, we watch from  the side as GREGORY  dismounts, grabbing CHANDRA as he  steps over onto the  safe side of the  bike. A massive shower of sparks bursts and trails the bike. It tumbles like a bullet  falling  through syrup,  and  GREGORY keeps  walking  over the rotating surface, using  the bike to  protect him and  CHANDRA against the flesh-ripping concrete. THE bike is coming apart  as its bashed against the  concrete. Pieces rise slowly into the air -  the front wheel, the forks, the  mufflers, and a million flakes  of metal, until the  body bounces into the  air, carrying GREGORY  and CHANDRA  up. Holding  her to  him - shes barely conscious of the lightning-fast  crash, GREGORY rides the  flying body with one hand on the frame. It comes crashing down and back into  real time. THE  bikes body  streaks along  the highway.  The sparks  fade as  it slows, and pieces of metal come clanging and banging down around them. They  stop,  crouching  atop the  body,  with  GREGORY crouching  over CHANDRA. The disembodied front wheel rolls past them. STUNNED,  not quite  understanding how  or what  he just  did, he  and CHANDRA stand and start running. BEHIND  them is a blurry wall of  red and blue lights. POLICE SIRENS grow louder. THEY start running down the  highway, then GREGORY yanks CHANDRA  to a stop.",

GREGORY turns  and rushes  back to  her, even  as a  police cruiser is bearing down on them, its V-8 roaring and the siren IMPOSSIBLY LOUD. GREGORY drops  to her  side, only  to look  up into  the blinding high beams. He  drops over  CHANDRA, ducks  his head  and extends  his hand toward the oncoming cruiser and we drop back into BULLET TIME. THE CRUISER  runs into  his hand  and stops  as though  it hit a steel post. The hood crumples  in the center, pushing  the grill in even  as the front quarter  panels of the  unibody continue around  GREGORY and CHANDRA. INT. CRUISER THE ENGINE smashes in through  the console, pushing the cops  apart as the glass windshield explodes and  their seats slide forward into  the console, smashing them like jelly. CU: GREGORY AND CHANDRA WITH  HIS  HAND  still  on  the  grille,  CHANDRA  AND  GREGORY remain untouched, even as the entire police cruiser rips around them. WE drop back into REAL  time and see  the cruisers body  rip over and  around them. The grille and engine block and part of the mangled transmission remain still against  GREGORYS HAND. The  cruiser was gutted,  like a banana shot down the center from top to bottom. It speeds beyond them, silent now, flips and explodes. THE ENGINE block is suspended a few  feet in the air. It drops to  the ground with a thud. GREGORY and CHANDRA get to their  feet and run into the early  morning desert. CU: GUTTED CRUISER UNBELIEVABLY, the driver is still alive... barely. The steering  wheel is smashed deep  into his mouth,  splitting his jaw  open. Wet, broken chokes emanate from his blood-filled mouth. His eyes flicker, and just before they close forever, his body is seized by pain as he MORPHS. EXT. GUTTED CRUISER THE CRUMPLED DOOR is knocked out  of the frame. WE SEE a  black loafer step from the vehicle and a man in an immaculate black suit steps  out slowly. WE rise  up from  the loafer.

The tracers grow into a cone of orange flame bearing down on NEO as we drop into bullet time. THE bullets sizzle  as tracers burn  off their backs.  The draw toward him like  slugs. Thousands  of bullets  fired at  perpendicular angles close  in on  him. As  they draw  close to  one another  along almost perpendicular paths, they tinkle and chime and bounce. The bullets come to a stop, glowing as their tracers backs continue to burn.  The world  is in  stop motion  as the  bullets stop,  turn 180 degrees, and  suddenly accelerate  back at  their origins.  Faster and fast they fly, until we drop back into REAL TIME. THE SKIRMISH line  of troops is  ripped apart by  a hail of  their own bullets. CU: MACHINE GUNNER. With an M-249 SAW, he blazes away at NEO, only  to be shredded by his own bullets. A  private takes a shot at NEO, and  a bullet slaps into his  shoulder. REALIZING whats happening,  he drops his weapon. THE SOLDIERS are dropping like flies. The firing quickly subsides. NEO stands  alone in  the center,  unharmed. He  turns to the skirmish lines.  THE  surviving soldiers  drop  their weapons,  and  run. Panic ensues.

They attack at once, one going low and hard with a  knee breaking sweep kick, the other punching NEO in the face, and the third breaking to the  side and putting  his toe into  NEOs stomach with  a vicious side-kick. They attack  is in  perfect synch,  eight arms  and eight legs working like clockwork, striking  their target without  getting in the  way of each other. The attack slams NEO back, right into the first,  bloodied SMITH. NEO slams into his shoving arms, and stops as though he  backed into a  brick wall.  AGENT SMITH  grabs him  and holds  him in  a FULL NELSON, exposing him  to his three  copies. The copies  shift position and attack again. Two stand together, left shoulder to right, and with their combined arms slam NEO in the face, then step apart as the third comes in. The THIRD  grabs the shoulders of  the other two and  flips, walking his loafers up NEOs  body, and kicking him from  below, right up into  the chin  of his  jaw! It  snaps NEOs  back with  a spray of blood. EXT. ROOFTOP MORPHEUS and NIOBE stare on as the fight rages. MORPHEUS grips  the edge  of the  brick wall  edge. The stone crumbles under the tension.",

He attacks, his killing blows destroying SMITH, smashing through his blocks. He falls, and NEO takes on the other two, giving a kick jump that knocks both of them away in one shot. As he comes  down, a wall  of Smiths converges  from all sides.  They stop, leaving a circle around him. WE PAN BACK to view a sea of black-suited SMITHS flooding the plaza.

PLAZA HE exits into the street. The scene is one from HELL. UNDER the neon  sky, fires are  frozen and smoke  columns hang in  the air, still, like massive tree trunks. The battle rages and surges,  a thousand SMITHS pouring onto  one NEO. All around, nearly covering the ground, are corpses, destroyed  bodies abandoned  by the  agent. Men  and women,  of all  ages and  designs, smashed, decapitated and broken. CU: NEO THE SMITHS overwhelm him  with sheer numbers. NEO  is a blur, a  human chainsaw now,  crushing or  smashing them  all, but  they crowd on all sides. The bodies pile up as they fall, and NEO finds himself stepping up the rubbery mass of corpses. A few more smashed SMITHS fall,  morph back into their stolen forms, and NEO is KNEE-DEEP IN THE DEAD. He cant take it. Choking, NEO struggles to free himself. SMITHS climb up the corpse pile and drop onto him, pounding viciously. NEO  stalls, in shock, his eyes  locked with the lifeless  blue eyes of a  woman he just killed. She looks amazingly like TRINITY. Perhaps for the first time, he is confronted with the consequences  of this war, and his mind seizes as the Smiths pummel him. NEO goes  berzerk! SCREAMING  and fighting,  he claws  his way out and surges into the wall of agents. They throw him back, and he cant kill them fast  enough. HE  leaps upward,  trying to  fly away,  but Smiths cling on to him, and cling on to each other. EXT. PLAZA NEO struggles to  fly, and as  he does, hes  pulling a stalagtite  of black suits, clinging like iron filings on a magnet. CU: NEO HIS face  is wide  with fear  and shock.  He cant  climb anymore, and looks back down at the mountain  of agents hes pulling into the  air. His face  clenches shut  as a  scream wells  from deep  within him. He starts to glow, and we jump back to see: A MASSIVE orange, spherical shock  wave blasts away from his  body. It rebounds on the plaza and throws bodies upward, even as it blasts  the Smiths away, leaving him clean. EVERYTHING slows down  as NEO, exhausted,  tumbles out of  the sky. On his way down  through the neon  light, he passes  bodies flying upward from the  concussion. NEO  hits the  ground, bounces,  and lies still, sprawled,  as people  drop all  around him,  piling up,  like Satans snowfall. EXT. ALLEY (MATRIX) DAY THE sky and Matrix are still  frozen. TRINITY and CHOI make their  way along cautiously, leapfrogging from cover to cover. They pause  behind a dumpster, and  just before looking  out, theres the  sound of metal tapping metal, twice. TRINITY looks in  the direction of  the sound. MORPHEUS  and NIOBE are standing still in the shadows, near the end of the alley. TRINITY  AND CHOI make their way to them. TRINITY peeks  cautiously around  the edge.  On the  other side of the street is a phone booth.",

                        "raw_text": "\"Yeah, tanks a lot.\" They break. CHOI stands on his own, and they run back onto the  street with the tanks. CU: TANKS THREE ABRAMS stop in the  street. Their turrets swing into  place with terrifying quickness and precision. AT ONCE,  they open  fire with  their main  cannons and machines guns. FIRE FLOWERS blaze from the death machines, sending a typhoon of  lead down the street.  Troops filed between  the tanks pull  their triggers and dont let go. Everything in the street is shredded and blown away, as though it was hit by a high-power pressure hose. WITH UNEARTHLY  SPEED, EVERYONE  BREAKS for  the sides  of the street, except for CHOI. He stands amid  it all as the tracers come  closer to his body. He raises his machine  gun with his good arm, and  lays into the enemy. TRACER rounds kick away from  his gun, ripping straight back  into the wall  of soldiers.  His rounds  deflect off  the sloped  armor of  the tanks, recoils pile into the flesh  of troops. He rakes his fire  into the enemy bodies. CU: CHOI TRACERS zoom in on  him. A tank round  blasts by, and the  wall of air kicks him to his side. He continues to fire even as a bullet, followed by  another, blasts  through the  middle of  his body.  More and  more bullets smack into  him, blasting chunks  of meat and  viscera out the back. EXT. STREET (MATRIX) DAY TRINITY and NIOBE  take one side  of the street,  running and shooting simultaneously. THEY reach  the buildings on  the side and  NIOBE goes STRAIGHT UP THE FACADE OF THE BUILDING, as TRINITY jumps from cover to cover, cart wheeling through tracer fire and bullets. ON  THE  OTHER side  of  the street,  MORPHEUS  goes straight  up  the building  facade  and  starts  running  sideways,  completely  defying gravity, firing downward at the soldiers. CU: CHOI HE WILL NOT FALL, and a hose of lead drills into him, taking his  body apart piece by piece. Bullets take away pieces of his head, neck,  and torso, and in one final wave of fire, he is disintegrated, leaving his machine gun, barrel  smoking, spinning in  the air, firing  still. The arm is still attached and finger  clenching on the trigger. It is  the last piece of CHOI to fall. MORPHEUS climbs  as he  runs. In  mid-stride he  changes magazines and stops, standing on the wall, his body parallel to the ground. On the other side of the street, NIOBE stands on the wall, blazing  at the mass of troops with two  guns that never cease. THERE is  no cover and  no reprieve  from the  DOUBLE DEATH  from above.  Most are  still firing down the street, or over toward TRINITY. TRINITY runs  up the  side of  the street.  Her guns  go empty and she dives behind a stoop as a squad of soldiers blazes away at her. CU: SOLDIER In slow motion, he  pulls a spoon from  a grenade. Somehow, the  metal ring reaches TRINITYS ears. CU: TRINITY She slaps a magazine into her  pistol, pulls the action and comes  out from under cover just enough to see the soldier releasing the grenade. She fires, hitting the grenade. IT explodes directly over the group of soldiers, flattening them to the ground. A  BULLET smacks  through TRINITYS  wrist, and  the hand  comes off, popping like the head off  a dandelion. Blood spurts from  the severed arteries, spraying the hand, with the pistol still in its grip. ABOVE THE STREET, MORPHEU AND  NIOBE leap for one another.  They catch each others arms, fifty feet  above the surviving enemy, and  spin in place, firing away. The tank commanders in their copulas blast  upward with their  machine guns,  but the  rounds miss  the spinning  couple. MORPHUES and NIOBE concentrate on the commanders, and cut them down. THEY land amidst  the carnage. TRINITY  emerges, shaken, pressing  her coat to her arm. EXT. STREET (MATRIX) - DAY The other end of the street fills with soldiers, and AGENT BROWN. CU: AGENT BROWN HE surveys the  scene, and immediately  draws and fires,  running full bore for the rebels. MORPHEUS, Niobe and TRINITY are too close to the tanks to be fired on, but the nearest one lunges at them. They climb up over concrete stoops and over  the side  of the  tank. They  sprint down  the street as the tanks turn their turrets behind them, searching.",

Morpheus throws the  woman forward as the tank round hits  the edge of the building, blowing  the concrete and brick wall into a massive cloud of powder. Perhaps a  ton of rubble falls on Morpheus legs. He drags himself forward. Niobe and Trinity grab his arms and haul him out of the rubble. Niobe shoots the lock off a steel door, and they pile into the building. EXT. STREET (MATRIX) - DAY AGENT BROWN  and his  men rush  into position  around the building the rebels are hiding in. Suddenly, an unimaginably powerful engine  starts, and as we stare  at the  garage door,  it explodes  outward. A  jet-black, hyped  COUNTACH explodes out onto the street, tires literally on fire as they throw up smoke. It cuts through a few  soldiers, hitting them in the knees,  as it rips up the street, the throttle going way too high. INT. COUNTACH (MATRIX) - DAY THE street scene spins before them. TRINITY is at the wheel, a  broken and dusty MORPHEUS sitting next to  her. The tach is redlining as  the car rips up the street. Pedestrians dive for cover. TRINITY holds her wounded hand to her chest and drives one-handed. \"Shift.\" MORPHEUS does so,  and the tires  squeal again when  she releases into second, then  third. In  a few  seconds theyre  over 60  on the  busy street. EXT. STREET (MATRIX) - DAY Soldiers pick themselves up  just in time to  hear another engine -  a super powerful track bike, emerges from the burnt rubber smoke screen. A wheely bar on the back of the bike keeps it from flipping around the rear tire as it accelerates like a bullet out of a barrel. There isnt even time to take a shot until shes gone. INT. COUNTACH (MATRIX) - DAY THEY rocket up the entry to a highway, ripping past cars by driving up the breakdown lane.  Once they hit  a straightaway Trinity  floors it, and the speedo creeps up past 130 as they dodge in and out of cars. MORPHEUS grabs his twisted, folded legs. He was literally poured  into the seat. Concentrating, his face knotting in pain, he straightens the broken, fractured legs. He closes his eyes and concentrates.",

He turns away,  just as the distant  GREGORY is falling out  of sight. Just before he does, the speck of a person PULLS up, and  grows larger and larger as  it returns. A contrail  streaks behind him as  a rips through  the air.  FISTS FORWARD,  GREGORY is  like an MX missile bearing on NEO. NEO turns just in  time to catch BOTH  FISTS in his chest.  Like a cue ball striking another billiard,  all Gregors momentum is  transferred into Neo. Gregor stops dead in the air as Neo is hurtled out of view.

Gripping Gregor by the neck and his  belt, he drives straight down. The  ground rushes, it takes  one second to  drop past a  50-story skyscraper. Neo slams  Gregor,  front first,  into  the concrete  sidewalk.  They bust through the sidewalk, into the sewer below. INT. SEWER (MATRIX) - DAY NEO stands. Offscreen,  we can here  choking breaths. Neo  looks down. Gregor lies twisted on a concrete slab, impaled multiple times through the chest by snapped, rusty rebar.  He takes one last breath, and  his eyes half-close. NEO checks the pulse. Finding nothing, he leaps out of the hole. CU: GREGORY HIS eyes  blink, and  he follows  NEOs departure.  Choking, unable to breath with the rebar through him, he writhes. Theres nothing for him to grab to pull himself off the steel. His eyes clenched  shut, Gregor levitates,  by force of  will, pulling his body off the rebar.  The corrugated bars make wet,  sucking sounds as the pull through his body.  Finally, he gets to a twisted  piece of bar, and cant make it over. Hes losing all his breath, all his  life force, over one piece of twisted steel protruding from his chest. WITH one  last, wiggling  effort, he  works it  through him. HIS mouth opens wide, but no sounds emit, lest he recall Neo. Just as the end of the steel bar enters his body and we cant take any more,",

REST STOP (MATRIX) Morpheus and  Smith clash  in the  dust -  punches, kicks,  and blocks coming too  fast to  see. Smith  is wailing  on Morpheus, but Morpheus sneaks in a  kick that separates  them. They take  stances a good  two distances away. Theyre about to go at it again when: NIOBE sprints  into the  fight. Performing  a flying  leap kick, Smith grabs her  and swings  her down,  crashing her  body into the concrete with a sickening crack-thud. She rolls, fighting the pain, as Morpheus flies  back into  action, catching  the agent  with a  furious ass  of swinging kicks. Niobe grits back the pain and rejoins her love. Together they  assault the agent, their speed almost, almost equaling his, their will  capped by the limits of their Matrix-bending powers. Finally, Smith resurges. He  lands  a punch  into  Niobes stomach,  and  her body  folds  over unnaturally, as if her back is broken. She crumples to the deck, blood pouring from her mouth. MORPHEUS screams and brings a hammer blow down on the back of  Smiths neck,  smashing  the  agents  face  down  and  imprinting  it  in the concrete. For a  moment, Smith is  still. Morpheus collects  Niobe and runs for the phone booth, which is still ringing. ITS too far. Smith grabs him around the knees, spilling him  forward. Man handling him like he weighs nothing, Smith gets on top of him  and starts smashing his fists down into Morpheus face.",

MORPHEUS 3-D  avatar flashes  on a  console, along with a massive array of weapons. EXT. BOOTH (MATRIX) - SUNSET MORPHEUS disappears for a second, then reappears. Now he is  perfectly clean, and immaculately dressed. He replaces his sunglasses and  kicks through  the remains  of the  booth, walking  toward the  fight as  he produces new weapons, heavy with ammo, from his long coat. RAZOR keeps  swinging at  SMITH -  and missing.  Seeing his chance, he runs back for the ringing  phone. SMITH pursues, almost on  RAZOR when the neo-samurai jumps in the  air and pirouhettes, swinging one  sword after another, like a helicopter blade from Hell. IN the liquid  world of slo-mo,  the short sword  cuts through Smiths outstretched fingers, sending them  flying. The long sword  grazes his forearm, cutting through the fabric  and taking off a slice  of flesh. The tip of  the sword slices  through his suit,  cutting his tie  off, digging about an inch into his torso. SMITH collapses into the dust, his  face a mask of blood and  dust. He doesnt try to get up. RAZOR passes MORPHEUS, who backs up to the ringing phone booth.  Razor goes  through first.  MORPHEUS keeps  his eyes  and weapon  locked on SMITH, who  makes no  attempt to  pursue. He  stands calmly,  and in a dignified manner, wipes dust off  his clothing as he watches  Morpheus step into the booth, and replace the phone. It rings. One hand on the receiver, Morpheus stares back at Smith. SMITH stands there, not attempting to pursue. Morpheus pauses,  taking advantage of the chance to observe his deadly enemy. SMITH stares at the booth for a second. Emotion twists his face, first anger,  then  perhaps  sadness.  Hes lost.  Hell  be  in  the Matrix forever. With a quicksilver flash,  his body reverts back  to the shape of  the rookie cop. THE young  man is  left standing  there. He  is filthy,  bloody, badly sliced up, and the fingers of one hand are missing. He looks around at the carnage  as his  mouth simply  opens and  closes, reflexively,  in shock. He focuses on Morpheus. The rebel answers the phone and disappears, leaving the cop, his  body broken and his mind blown. INT. MAIN DECK - NIGHT CIRCA helps MORPHEUS off the interface chair. Razor is triumphant.",
