Cut to Edgar, the same, turning a corner to see Silus approaching him. Silus raises his gun. A puff emits from the end of his gun. The projectile hurtles towards Edgar, who just ducks out of the way in time. Edgar turns. There is a grill next to him. He smashes it with his foot.

Edgar is on top of Silus and strangling him, and then he stops and turns. He moves just in time to avoid a bullet from Jones' gun which glances Edgar's cheek, sending off a wisp of burnt colored smoke. Cut to Jones. Gun smoking, standing at the other end of the hall. Edgar screams the scream of something from the animal kingdom. Then turns and runs. Cut to Silus rising, pulling out his gun. Jones points his gun, but Silus is obscuring his view. Cut to Edgar runs away down the hall. Then on Silus. Very still, very silent. Close on his finger pressing the trigger. 45 The camera zooms right into the interior of the gun to see the projectile entering the gun's chamber and the hammer igniting it. The projectile explodes out the end of the gun. High Angle of the projectile flying towards its target, the ceiling lights above streaking past on its reflective surface, cruel mechanical claws suddenly slide out from the side of the capsule. Then Edgar, camera tracking back at high speed. Slow move in on Silus' cool gray eyes. Then whack! The projectile stabs into Edgar's back, the claws springing forward to hook onto Edgar's flesh, we see the fluid within the transparent projectile flow into Edgar, see Edgar's eyes widen, see his POV of the approaching window then... Crash. Edgar's head implants itself in the wall below the window, the dust and debris from the wall board drifting over Edgar's numb stare. In the background Silus stands. Motionless. We see Jones walking forward, gun still pointing, heading towards Edgar. Silus turns and steps in front of him.",

Flash edits of Edgar. Standing, posing, balancing literally on his fingertips, doing sensuous, slow gymnastic yoga. His hair has changed so we know time has passed. Finally he stands there; poised tensile steel. He slowly draws his finger nails against the shining floor of the cell, it almost looks like he's sharpening them. A tube comes from his arm for taking blood samples. Then Edgar begins to run directly at the glass window of the console room and then dives for it, smashing his head against it; blood and saliva left smeared there. Behind the glass window the console operators jump. 60A INT: BROTHERHOOD BUILDING, SECURITY CONTROL ROOM - CONTINUI60A CONSOLE OPERATOR 1",

Silus slowly enters frame, moves his face close to Lilly, moves along her arm as if taking in her scent.

Then he moves over to the girl. She    stares up at him with her tear stained grimy face.

And in a shaft of light Lilly can see a hand slapping at the wet wall. But it is less a hand than a claw. And the face that follows the hand; the red, reflective eyes of one of the half mad, the infected. The thing catches sight of Lilly, then propels itself towards her. We see it's POV, approaching faster, faster. And Lilly reaching out with her foot, to the door, struggling to hook it with her foot, trying to close it, almost catching the door handle, but her foot is so slippery and the thing is almost on her. Then she stretches out with her foot, just catching the door and slams it in the face of the thing that is about to attack her. The thing on the other side of the door is now screaming wildly and the door handle is jerking down as the creature tries to activate it and Lilly has her feet on it, trying desperately to keep the door shut, but her feet keep slipping. And then she realizes that the pipe from which she hangs is beginning to wobble - water is now coursing from the hole in the wall, beginning to flow faster and faster. Her feet slip more and more on the door. Lilly tries to keep the door closed, but her feet are too slippery and the thing is pushing through the door. In the dark space only its eyes and slavering mouth are clear, hands grasping for Lilly legs, scratching at them, Lilly twisting, the creature's nails searching for purchase on her legs. Lilly hauls herself up, wrapping her legs around the pipe she's attached to. The thing below her is groaning incoherently, reaching up, its hands grabbing at her, Lilly pulling herself just out of reach, then seeing the eyes below her, wanting her. Lilly tries to pull herself higher. And then she feels it. The pipe she's attached to is shifting, where it joins the wall. Water is now flooding from it, the pipe jerks down, some of the old wall giving way. The creature's fingers are now able to grasp Lilly's t-shirt, drag at it, pull at her, screaming, the pipe grinding, water flowing and then the whole thing comes down, the pipe bursting out of the wall. Lilly and the pipe falls, right on top of the creature. For a moment neither of them move, then the creature is grabbing at Lilly's hair, pulling her head back. In a flash Lilly pulls the pipe to which she is attached right into the face of the creature. This gives her time to stagger upright. She's still chained around the pipe; she can see the end of the pipe near the door. 102 She begins to slide the chains back as the creature begins to rise and advance towards her. Lilly desperately slides the chain along the pipe. It catches on a protrusion, while the creature advances. Lilly frees it just in time, falling backwards as the creature jumps at her, Lilly lifting the chain up to hold the creature back. The creature strains to get at Lilly. Lilly now has the chain at the creature's neck. She begins to tighten it around the creature's neck, her only hope now. The creature changes now, from frightening to pitiful as it realizes it can't breath, it's fingers desperately moving over Lilly's face, almost pleading. Tears form in Lilly's eyes as she tightens the stranglehold; there is no anger there, just desperation, and behind that, pity. The creature breathes it's last breath then collapses onto Lilly. 123 OMITTED                                                      123 AND                                                              AND 124                                                              124 124A INT: JAMESTOWN SLUM, HIDEOUT, STEAMROOM - CONTINUING        124A Edgar and Silus stalk each other in the steam room. Edgar launches himself towards Silus, but Silus is now too quick. Silus slams Edgar sideways into a pipe, an imprint of Edgar's face left on the pipe. 103 Stunned Edgar releases his grip, stumbles back, Silus rising now, he has him. Again, Silus slams Edgar's head into another pipe. And now Silus has Edgar's throat in his fist and the look on Silus' face tells Edgar he will not escape. We see Edgar, beginning to lose consciousness now, dying. Steam now rises all around them from broken pipes. Then behind Silus, Edgar can make something out. An old, corroded tank, steaming, with the words sterilizer on it. There are a series of long shafts connected to the sterilizer via a tube and held in position by clamps; they look like they're for sterilizing bottles. With a last effort Edgar propels Silus backwards onto one of the shafts, making Silus grimace and clutch his back where he's been pierced, then slide to the ground. The piercing has operated some lever so that steam now also drifts from the wound on Silus' back. Cut to Silus looking up, clutching his back with the pain of it. And now Edgar above him. He removes one of the sterilizer shafts from the bracket that holds it. He clutches a lever on the side which makes viciously hot steam pulse from the end of the shaft. Edgar moves slowly towards Silus. We see Silus, unable to rise, crawling back, until bang, he's stopped by more pipes behind him. Nowhere to go. And Edgar ready to pounce. He does, driving the shaft towards Silus' head. Silus manages to raise one hand to Edgar's wrist to stop the shaft from piercing his skull. Now the shaft is right in Silus' face, the lightly steaming hole staring back at Silus. Edgar's finger moves to the lever on the side of the shaft, ready to get some steam going.",
