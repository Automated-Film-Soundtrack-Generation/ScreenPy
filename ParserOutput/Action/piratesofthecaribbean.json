PORT ROYAL - TOWN - ALLEY - DAY The fog creeps through, casting an eerie twilight pall. An armed search party moves along the street. They glance down an alley- On the far side is another search party. The men nod to each other, continue on. A moment, and then Jack drops from his hiding place beneath the eaves of a building. He still wears the manacles. Across the street is a shop with barn doors, a pass-thru door set in the middle. Above is a sign with a black anvil. INT. BLACKSMITH'S FORGE - DAY Jack slips in through the door, takes a look around: No windows. The forge is dark, lit   by lanterns. Work-in- progress is scattered about: wagon   wheels, wrought iron gates, pipes -- even a cannon with   a crack in it. But every tool is in place; the workbench is   tidy and neat. Jack is startled by a noise: MISTER BROWN, in a blacksmith's apron, snores in the corner, cradling a bottle. Jack gives him a hard poke. Another. Brown snorts, turns away. Satisfied, Jack sheathes his sword, takes a short-handled sledge from its place on the wall. Moves to the glowing coke furnace in the middle of the room. Slowly... he holds his right hand over the furnace, the chain down in the embers. The chain begins to GLOW. Jack sweats, grimaces at the pain - Moving quickly, he wraps the chain around the nose of an anvil, brings the sledge down with a fast, hard stroke on the glowing links. One SHATTERS. Jack drops the sledge, plunges his manacled hand in a bucket of water. Steam billows. Jack pulls his hand out, flexes it. Blisters form beneath the manacle -- but his hands are free. The SOUND of the latch on the door -- Jack dives for cover. Will enters the forge, shuts the door behind him. Spots the drunken Mister Brown in the corner.",
