EXT. CHRIS' POSITION - NIGHT Chris jerks awake - very suddenly, very frightened.  THE RAIN HAS STOPPED.  The jungle sounds are loud.  Cicadas, night animals, water dripping hypnotically from leaf to leaf.  And the whirr of a million mosquitoes out after the rains, chewing at Chris' face. He looks around, startled. Tex is asleep.  Junior is asleep.  What happened?  He looks at his watch.  The mosquitoes are eating him alive.  He buries his head in his green towel which he wears around his neck, but he can't see.  A beat.  He moves again, miserable from the bites. Another beat.  Then suddenly the sounds of the jungle shift - some of the animals dropping out.  A different tone.  A piece of wood is stepped on, a rustle of bush ... Chris sees something, lifts an edge of the towel to peek out. A shoadow of a figure is frozen there in front of him about 15 yards.  It looks like a man.  But it doesn't move.  At all.  It listens. Chris, his heart in his mouth, tries to peer through it.  It's a bush.  It has to be.  No human being could stand that still.  His heartbeats are up.  The moments take forever.  But deep down - somewhere in his psyche - he knows who it is. The figure now shifts, ever so slightly - and moves.  It IS a human being.  Oh my God! Chris looks around.  Tex seems like a mile away.  Why doesn't anyone fire!  He casts a desperate look at his rifle, at his grenades encrusted with mud, but in spite of all his training, he is frozen with indecision and fear at the sight of his enemy. The figure seems to whisper something back, then turns and comes down the trail.  Now a second and third figure appear behind him - all in helmets and packs.  All coming right past Chris' position.  Ten yards.  Nine. Chris is rigid with terror.  Stark eyes.  Pleading with Tex to wake up, but out of reach.  He is about to have an anxiety attack, his heartbeats so far up he is sure they will hear him. The first figure is now directly in front of Chris on the trail, looking left and right.  A rattle of his equipment, a creak of leather.  A smell.  The man's face now catches the moonlight and his eyes come around on Chris. Oriental eyes.  Looking right at him.  Startled.  Chris staring back, hypnotized.  It all happens very fast.  The figure murmurs something in Vietnamese.  A warning.  He swivels. A flash of muzzle fire.  A raking cough of automatic fire.  A grenade explosion. Chris is hurled to the ground, helmet bouncing off, scattered, confused, jarred.  All hell breaks loose around him with NOISE and SHOUTS. Tex, kissing the ground, is yelling at him.",

It's like a private cabaret for the 'heads' who are there cooling out. Boxes of food from the States, beers, whiskey bottles, crates functioning as tables, hammocks hanging from poles, electric fans, tape decks, paraphenalia. The boys are all dressed up in their Saturday night rags.  The clothes are clean, the headbands, the medallions are out, anything distinctive and individualistic.  On the tapedeck, Jefferson Airplane's 'Go Ask Alice'. To Chris it is a new world.  And RHAH, the resident head, sitting there in all his finery puffing a huge burning red bowl in a three foot long Montagnard pipe, seems to be the lord of final judgement in this smoky underworld. Across his naked chest, birds and snakes are tatooed.  Around his neck a black skull and white ivory cross side by side.  On his knuckles 'Love' and 'Hate' are tattooed.  In his eyes, a dancing Satanic fire.  A poor rural Southern white, in his grizzled late 20's, he could be a Biker King.  Giving Chris the once-over.",

We sense Elias loves the danger, smiling. EXT. NVA BUNKER - COMPLEX - MAIN POSITION - DAY Lt. Wolfe signals Manny and Chris out onto the two flanks. INT. NVA TREEHOUSE - DAY Rhah and King explore a treehouse.  Rice stores.  Rhah, an experienced soldier, seems tense, moves cautiously, expecting booby traps. EXT. NVA BUNKER - WARREN'S POSITION - DAY Sgt. Warren cautiously explores another bunker, probing a little tunnel in the bottom of it with a stick.  Bunny, having a small frame, goes down into it, fearless. EXT. NVA BUNKER - MANNY'S POSITION - DAY Manny, the skinny black boy with the coloured beads, is out on flank - alone, smoking a cigarette, humming. EXT. NVA BUNKER - CHRIS' POSITION - DAY On the other flank, Chris, also alone, waits, listening to the sounds of the jungle.  He too is smoking a cigarette.  The eeriness is everywhere.  Rays of morning light peeking through the cathedral dome of the jungle.  Bird calls. INT. NVA TUNNEL - DAY Elias climbs deeper and deeper into the hole, a rope attached to his waist leading out to the surface, his flashlight now coming around on a shaftway demarcating a TUNNEL that seems to stretch for at least 100 yards.  The light revealing cobwebs all along it, but tall enough for a small man. EXT. CHRIS' POSITION - DAY It's quiet, weird.  Chris takes his pants down, squats.  He thinks he hears something, tenses. There is a soft rustling sound now.  And as he focuses on it he realizes it is coming from very close to him.  Something light and sinuous moving over the leaves.  He looks down. A bright yellow and orange-ringed krait viper is crawling right between his two legs.  It stops, senses another life standing over it. Chris frozen with dread. The snake crawls on, pulling its long, long 15 foot body behind it. On Chris, eyes dilated, slowly regaining his breath looking around everywhere now. INT. NVA TUNNEL - DAY Elias moving down the tunnel, fearless.  We expect something any moment to come out and nail him but nothing does.  He stops.  His flashlight revealing a kitchen and an NVA hospital set up.  A hammock swings as if someone just deserted it.  In another hammock is a dead man.  Elias advances cautiously. EXT. NVA BUNKER - COMPLEX - SANDERSON POSITION - DAY Spec 4 Sanderson, the big handsome blond kid, is moving through an abandoned bunker.  With him is Sal, a tough street kid with an intense face, all whiskered.  Sanderson noticing now a metal box of 50-caliber ammo, U.S. marking, half-buried in the ground.",

BARNES' JUNGLE - DAY Barnes, moving through the jungle, reacts to the fire, resetting his course.  Like a hunter stalking a deer.  Suddenly there's more firing.  Then silence - EXT. ELIAS' JUNGLE - DAY TWO MORE ENEMY lie dead in the jungle.  A rustle of movement, then a CRY - chilling, jubilant, a war cry. A pair of feet moving lightly over the jungle.  A glimpse of Elias.  In his full glory.  Roaming the jungle, born to it. EXT. BARNES' JUNGLE - DAY Barnes fixing on him, moving. EXT. ELIAS' JUNGLE - DAY An NVA SOLDIER, jungle-whiskered, dirty, smart, crouches, listens, looks to his PARTNER.  What are they fighting here?  The First One mutter something sharp and they split fast in the direction they've come. They get about six steps when Elias suddenly rises up from the bush, not ten yards in front of them, his shots ripping into them, driving the surprised life from them.  Elias is gone. EXT. NVA JUNGLE - DAY Elsewhere, another three NVA stop, turn and flee back from where they came. EXT. JUNGLE CHURCH - DAY Chris and Rhah get Crawford back to the church grounds, lay him down.  No activity around them.  Chris plunges back into the jungle where they left Barnes.",

He brings his rifle up smooth and quick, waits, then as the bush parts, Elias is standing there. Looking at Barnes. Barnes sees him, starts to lower his rifle, but then stops.  He raises it back an inch, sights it.  Pause.  A cold searing look of hatred coming over his face. In that moment, Elias understands.  Quick as a deer, he makes his move, trying to plunge back into the bush. Barnes fires.  Once, twice, three times - the blast rocking the jungle. Elias jerking backwards into the bush, mortally wounded.  Bird cries.  A crime against nature. Barnes calmly lowers his rifle, and walks away from it. EXT. CHRIS' JUNGLE - DAY Chris, cutting through the jungle, hears the shots.  He stops, listens.  Someone is moving through bush towards him, leaves and foliage shaking. Chris tightens, raises his rifle. Barnes steps through into his sight - sees him. Chris lowers his rifle.  Barnes walking past him as if he weren't even there.",

(waits) Silence, then a vague MURMURING - becoming clearer and clearer. It's in Vietnamese.  The radio is then bashed in, the sound like thunder in the Captain's ear.  He looks at his RTO, both of them shocked. EXT. NVA JUNGLE - NIGHT/DUSK In the Jungle itself, the ENEMY is moving.  Flurries of movement and sound, blurred visuals.  Hands taping a piece of cloth to a tree, moving on - revealing a luminous arrow pointing left ... Figures moving past it. Hands unraveling a thin wire waist-high, backwards. Hands sliding along another wire.  We now see a moving helmet with a luminous plaque on the back of it, leading a file up the wire.  To a Jump-off point about 50 yards outside the U.S. perimeter.  Figures crouch.  Whispers.  Movement.  A pen flashlight on a drawing of the foxhole positions.  The NVA moving out in several directions at once. EXT. PERIMETER #3 - CHRIS' FOXHOLE - NIGHT On their foxhole, Chris and Francis wait anxiously.  Overhead the ARTILLERY keeps pounding into the ambush area.  Now SMALL ARMS FIRE can be heard picking up at random spots along the perimeter. The battle, like a tide, is obviously moving closer to them.",

A pidgen English, the words mauled, then a snatch of patriotic North Vietnamese music, played from a scratchy old record. Chris uneasy, looking at Francis who looks terrified.

Chris hesitates - a moment, a decision made now in angry passion - rises up and charges the NVA. SHADOWS scatter and tumble, caught by his surprise close-range fire.
