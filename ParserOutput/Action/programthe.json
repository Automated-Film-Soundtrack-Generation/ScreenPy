Camille hitting a powerhouse service ace, Joe lunging and whiffing the return. Camille crushing another forehand. Joe crushes it back, sends it over the fence and into the parking lot. Camille serving again at match point. Joe pops up a weak return. Camille puts it away with a powerhouse overhead, the ball almost knocking Joe down. He flings his racket against the fence.

The Black Tackle comes back, slamming a forearm up under Bud's chin, snapping his neck back. Joe, meanwhile, fades to pass, pump fakes, steps up. Bud Lite, chicken fighting the Black Tackle, sticks his fingers in the Tackle's eyes, then cut-blocks him to the ground. The Tackle falls on Bud, and smashes a fist into his ribs. Bud rolls him over. Joe spots his flanker back, MAURICE WARD, on a flag pattern. Lofts a perfect spiral to him in the corner of the endzone. Touchdown. The crowd goes wild, as Bud Lite pushes off the Black Tackle's throat getting up from the pile. Joe pumps a fist in the air, hugs Ward, as the team celebrates. MUSIC BEGINS.",

Darnell fakes a block, then rolls out for a screen pass. Georgia Tech's defensive line comes hard. Bobby flips the ball over the charging defenders. Darnell catches it, gets a good block from Bud Lite, then tucks in behind Ray who is out ahead blocking. There's only one linebacker to beat and Darnell will be into the secondary. Figuring Ray will block the guy, Darnell begins to look for the safeties. Ray, however, barely brushes the linebacker, who doesn't even break stride. He lowers his head, and drives into Darnell, his helmet hitting the football. Fumble! There's a scramble. The Yellow Jackets free safety comes up with it.",

Darnell and two defensive backs, one from each side, close on the ball as it cuts through the air, a perfect spiral. Darnell dives. The two defensive backs dive. The ball passes between their outstretched hands by a fraction of an inch, landing in Darnell's. He clutches it to his chest, rolls over, holds the ball up for the ref to see. Touchdown!
