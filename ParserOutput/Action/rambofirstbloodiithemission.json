They shoot across the uprushing landscape at 135 mph. INSERT - RAMBO'S L.E.D. ALTIMETER Numbers flicking: 1,200 feet.  1,000.  800. Rambo signals. Their canopies deploy with a MUFFLED CRACK, simultaneously. RAMBO'S POV looking down past his swaying feet as the moonlit jungle rushes up... and up... A mahogany tree lunges like a huge hand. The dark maw swallows us in blackness. EXT.  RAIN FOREST Moonlight filters down through the foliage of massive trees, showing as shafts in the swirling night mists. This is one of the most primeval forests on the planet, a place of violent growth and death-filled shadows. Massive tree roots grip the earth, entwined with vines that climb swaying into the vaulted canopy above.  Water drips constantly. And life is everywhere.  Furtive.  Timeless.  Churning in the shallow pools, under the bark, in the sweating fruit... leaping through the matted foliage above. A FIGURE rises behind a rotting log, like a being from interstellar space.  Rambo removes his goggles and headset, then shrugs out of his chute harness. He looks around slowly.  Taking it in.",

He is stuck up to his knees in the mud of a small fenced yard containing a few pigs and chickens. The yard is adjacent to a large THATCH HUT, and four or five additional HOOTCHES are visible farther downslope, nestled among the trees. Brewer holds a finger to his lips, cautioning the pig to silence.  He lays backward in the black slop as a VIETNAMESE MAN in peasant pajamas comes to the door of the nearest hootch, an island of light in the dark forest. Smoking a cigarette he looks around, perhaps scanning for the source of the faint crashing he heard a moment before. Following a dirt road, little more than a trail between the hootches, an OLD WOMAN approaches.  She is barefoot, and pushes a rusting bicycle laden with an enormous bundle of firewood. Brewer struggles to free himself, straining in silence as the pigs step disdainfully around him. The man flicks away the cigarette.  He laughs raucously at something the old woman says and hurries to help her carry the firewood inside. Brewer looks up, at his chute billowing quietly in the branches overhead. The old woman pauses at the door, spits a shot of betelnut juice into the yard, and goes inside. The door bangs shut. TIGHT ON BREWER sighing with relief. SUDDENLY A DARK OBJECT SHOOTS INTO FRAME, seizing him. Brewer's head snaps around.  The object is Rambo's hand, painted camo-green. Rambo drags him with a sucking POP from the mud.

COMPOUND DOLLYING WITH RAMBO at ground level as he crawls under the wire and undulates from shadow to shadow. He reaches the nearest building.  Hugs it. Rambo moves on in silence.  He is barefoot, the pale skin smeared with mud, and carries only the PISTOL CROSSBOW. Without rifle, pack, harness or grenades to clatter, he moves like a spirit in the material world. Rambo raises one eye slowly over a window ledge. Inside several guards sleep soundly under mosquito netting.  Their rifles are stacked against the far wall. ANGLE ON GUARD snoring ludicrously loud.  He bats at a mosquito, grunts... turns over. ANGLE UNDER GUARD BARRACKS MOVING with Rambo as he crawls among the support posts. He freezes as a light is snapped on above him. It streams down through cracks between floorboards. Moving very slowly, Rambo squints through a gap. RAMBO'S POV A LOW ANGLE on a UNIFORMED GUARD rummaging in a tiny prehistoric refrigerator, humming to himself. He takes out a can of COKE, recognizable, although the label is in Chinese characters.  Rolls it slowly across his sweaty forehead.  Pops it.  The foam now runs onto the floor, drips into Rambo's eyes. The light snaps off.  FOOTSTEPS.  Rambo moves on. EXT.  PRISONERS' BARRACKS There are two rows of rusted iron bunks set out like a hospital ward.  Most of them are empty.  Seven aren't. SEVEN AMERICAN PRISONERS OF WAR Like the man in the cage they are gaunt, scabrous. Dressed in ragged peasant clothes too small for them. One man, bathed in sweat, moans and tosses with malarial fever.  Another is wrapped so tightly in a fetal position his face is between his knees. They have padded the bare springs of their cots with mattresses of rubber leaves. Rambo stands a few feet from them as if giving a benediction, the crossbow raised in one hand.  He moves on, leaving no trace. EXT.  GUARD TOWER The GUARD reclines in a folding chair, nodding to the beat of unheard music.  A SONY WALKMAN is clipped on his belt and he has the earphones over his GRAY PEAKED CAP. He takes a last drag and tosses a cigarette over the parapet. EXT.  PERIMETER - RAIN FOREST TIGHT ON BREWER hugging the ground as the smoldering butt lands five feet from him... in the pool of light from a floodlight.  He groans, watching the smoke curl up. Starts creeping his hand toward the butt. EXT.  COMPOUND - CAGE The man inside opens his eyes when Rambo touches his broomstick neck, feeling for a pulse. His lips are parched and there is a horrible bruise around one eye.",

Again he screams, almost a war cry now, and smashes his fist into the Russian's face with the force of his entire body behind it.  The big man's head ricochets off the wall into a second piledriver punch. Palyushin goes down. Podovsk groans and stirs until Rambo twists the knob. Despite a bad connection, Podovsk jerks spasmodically under the collapsed metal frame, lying in the puddle of water. Before Co can use the knife on Palyushin, Capt. Vinh enters, his expression agape.  He turns and bolts. INT.  CORRIDOR Vinh dashes out, SHOUTING MANIACALLY.  Behind him Rambo hurtles through the door, a blur, and smashes Vinh against the concrete wall. Vaulting over the crumpled camp commander without slowing, Rambo hits the outside door at a full run.  Just as Sgt. Tay is opening it from outside. EXT.  COURTYARD Tay's AK flies from his hands as he tumbles back. Rambo spins into him with a FLYING ROUNDHOUSE KICK which pitches him onto his back, an inert heap. INT.  INTERROGATION ROOM The transformer box shorts out under the continuous load, frying with a bright FLASH. The lights of the camp go out completely. EXT.  COURTYARD With Co close behind him, Rambo runs toward the compound fence. A SHOUT FROM NEARBY.  A RUNNING GUARD and Co open up with their assault rifles simultaneously. The guard dives for cover. Rambo lifts the wire for Co to wiggle under.  She reciprocates for him as the TOWER GUARD spins his long- unused PK MACHINE GUN and opens fire. Co fires from the shoulder. The tower guard flinches at the unexpected return fire. Dives.  His shots go wild.  Co's AK empties.  She drops it. Rambo and Co make it into the forest, running full out. MORE AKs OPEN UP behind them.  Both TOWER PKs. EXT.  RAIN FOREST HANDHELD PRECEDING RAMBO at a dead run as he crashes through foliage.  The forest is an insane blur. TRACERS WHIP BY, ruler-straight lines of red light... deadly fireflies. BARK EXPLODES from tree trunks around them.  Leaves are ripped into green confetti. They angle away from the blind firing.

RAIN FOREST Rambo at a dead run zig-zags along the dark game trail. The path steepens and he claws at exposed roots... climbing as much as running.  Behind him is the rising sound of rotors. EXT.  RAIN FOREST - NEAR CAMP Using HAND LIGHTS to follow his footprints, Tay's SQUAD OF SIX GUARDS jogs into the jungle.  Behind them, through the trees, the massive assault helicopter and its escort of Hueys rise into the night. The three choppers switch on their HIGH INTENSITY SEARCHLIGHTS as they thunder overhead. Shafts of light pierce the jungle.  Sweeping.  Searching. EXT.  FOREST Rambo is climbing rapidly, using roots as handholds to ascend the steep trail. The WHUMP-WHUMP of the helicopters approaches, the glare of light flickering behind him. Rambo moves into a densely woven thicket.  Freezes, watching.  Moves on. EXT.  FOREST - NEARBY The guards are ascending the trail like hounds. EXT.  FOREST - TRAIL Rambo crashes through foliage as a SEARCHLIGHT SWEEPS TOWARD HIM. It races over him, backlighting him as he dives off the trail. The searchlight flicks past him.  Snaps back. TRACERS rip down through the trees. RED SLASHES OF DEATH. Rambo tumbles, rolls, comes up running.  He tears through the jungle in a frenzy. The foliage is alive with blasting air. He dives over the edge of a muddy ravine, dropping through tangled vines.  Catching, clawing, dropping. He runs on. Totally manic. They can't target him. He hits a solid trail and sprints, really covering ground. The shaft of light scans back and forth behind him. Then farther away.  They've lost him.  For the moment. ANGLE ABOVE JUNGLE CANOPY as the choppers circle, seemingly dueling with lances of light. EXT.  TRAIL - NEARBY Rambo, moving rapidly, but more carefully, glides among the trees.  He stops at the BANK OF A TINY STREAM, setting down knife and pistol.  Scooping stinking BLACK MUD from the stream bed, he begins to slather it over his pale skin with quick, sure strokes.  Arms.  Legs.  Body... TIGHT ON RAMBO'S FACE eyes closed, as he smears the goo thoroughly over every exposed area.  His eyes open.  It is a neolithic, feral visage that turns away into the foliage. ON THE GUARDS moving forward cautiously.  Unfamiliar with tracking, and little else really except bullying weak prisoners, they crash around clumsily, falling and cursing in the dense thicket. CLOSE ON RAMBO moving in absolute silence nearby.  He freezes. Fifteen meters away is a SMALL WILD PIG, asleep under a knot of vines.  Rambo fires the makarov, hitting the earth near the pig.  It squeals and leaps up. THE GUARDS wave their AKs, looking for the source of the shot.  They hear something crashing through the undergrowth to the right.  Movement in dense brush.  They open fire. The CRASH OF SUSTAINED FIRE is deafening.  They blast blindly away, lighting up the forest. Their attention is so focused, the din so loud, they do not notice a dark figure moving up behind them. Rambo snatches the wayward last guard into a thicket, knife buried to the hilt, hand over his mouth. Tay shouts repeatedly to cease firing and the others finally stop. They move away, advancing on their \"target.\" Tay gingerly parts woven branches, revealing the pig, riddled with hundreds of 7.62mm rounds.  He turns to the others.",

Tay drops his rifle and runs back through the jungle. EXT.  RAIN FOREST - RIDGE Rambo climbs steadily.  The mud, dissolving in sweat, runs in streaks off his body.  He has stopped to slip on the FATIGUE PANTS he took from one of the guards.  The pants come to mid-calf but the material will protect against brambles and insects.

They shout and hit the deck, opening fire, as he dives on into the underbrush. Rambo runs, zig-zagging radically as small-arms fire laces the woods around him.  He crashes through foliage, abandoning stealth. LONG LENS WHIP-PANNING with Rambo as he charges down a long slope, the trees a green blur.  He crosses his arms over his face and batters through the brush with blind force. EXT.  HOOTCH Rambo bursts out of the dense tangle, dragging streamers of vines, and finds himself in an EXPLOSION OF SQUAWKING CHICKENS. He is in the muddy door-yard of a rural HOOTCH, part of a SMALL HAMLET, of about a dozen buildings. Pigs scatter, grunting their surprise, as Rambo sprints across the yard.  Over a low rail fence.  Between the hootches. Soldiers charge down the slope behind him. EXT.  HAMLET Rambo emerges onto the main \"street\" at a dead run, tearing a swath through the everyday village activities. The Viet peasants scatter as the fierce American charges through their midst.  A giant by their standards to begin with, Rambo is now a mud-caked nightmare, trailing vines and brambles... his face a mask of dark streaks topped by encrusted hair. He crashes into a panic-stricken young man on a bicycle, spilling them both.  Rolls.  Comes up running. Rambo changes course to intersect with an ANCIENT TRUCK which is accelerating away, headed out of the village. The truck, rusted and mud-caked into a brownish lump on wheels, is hauling a load of CHICKENS in a WIRE MESH CAGE on the flat bed. Rambo leaps onto the running board of the cab and points his pistol through the window at the terrified OLD MAN driving.",

ROAD Rambo clings tightly as the truck rattles and bounces over the rutted road, which shortly emerges from a stand of trees to run along a field of ELEPHANT GRASS. Rambo sees soldiers converging on the road through the trees on the other side.  Behind him, more emerge from the village and open fire. A bullet shatters the filthy windshield and the old driver loses control.  The truck veers into a ditch, slews, hurling up a sheet of water and flops ignominiously on its side. Rambo lands clear.  The old man begins to sob helplessly. The chickens scatter in all directions. CLOSE ON RAMBO, freeing a RUSTED GAS CAN from the twisted wreck of the truck bed. WIDE from behind the soldiers as they pour AK-47 bursts into the truck 50 meters away.  A figure dashes from the now-burning vehicle into the field of tall grass, disappearing. EXT.  ROAD - EDGE OF GRASS Two troop trucks are deploying soldiers as a group of OFFICERS stands near the chicken truck.  Sgt. Tay climbs down from a six-by cab.  Directing operations is Capt. Vinh.  His face is bruised and abraded, and one arm is on a sling. Vinh motions Tay impatiently toward where he stands at the edge of the elephant grass, and Tay wades into it, joining him.  Beyond them the coarse grass becomes an impenetrable wall almost EIGHT FEET HIGH. Vinh snorts in disgust at Tay and points at some trampled stalks.  There is a bright smear of blood, and beyond, another.  Vinh cuffs his sergeant.",

A line of THIRTY REGULARS moves into the grass.  Only the RADIO ANTENNAS of the squad leaders are visible above the waving stalks.  The helicopters arc in from the distant ridgeline, converging. EXT.  ELEPHANT GRASS POV, HANDHELD, MOVING SLOWLY THROUGH THE GRASS.  The point man parts the stalks ahead.  It is a quiet, eerie world, with only the SWISH OF THE GRASS and the occasional SOUND- OFF CALLS of the troopers.  There is a clear trail of blood smeared on the grass, indicating a serious wound. VARIOUS CLOSEUPS of the regulars as they advance, each man realizing how utterly isolated he really is, in his own island of space in the green sea.  It is hot.  Some of the soldiers have their fatigues unbuttoned, sleeves rolled up.  Sweat pours off them. POV, HANDHELD, following the trail of blood.  The grass is parted ahead and a small clearing comes into view. Slowly moving up on SOMETHING LYING IN THE GRASS. TWO CHICKENS, THEIR THROATS CUT, are lying beside the gas can, which is upright with its cap off.  A bizarre little shrine.  There is no sign of Rambo. REVERSE on the squad leader, puzzled, wary. INSERT - RAMBO'S HAND strikes a match, igniting a wet trail of SPILLED GAS with a WHOOSH. The squad leader looks up, seeing the river of fire snaking toward him through the waving stalks. He turns, panicked.  Crashes into the men behind him. Shrieks at them to move.  They trample over each other to run as the trail of fire reaches the can. VOOM! Tay sees a tremendous fireball erupt ahead.  Hears SCREAMING.  He freezes in his tracks as the nightmare begins again.  Shrieking, a man runs toward him, ON FIRE, charging past. Vinh shouts futilely into a radio.  Firing blindly, several troopers open up. EXT.  ROAD From the trucks it is apparent that the grass is burning on its own, in a long line where the \"fuse\" was laid out and in a widening circle around the explosion site. EXT.  IN THE GRASS Black smoke rolls through the grass, and troopers stumble about, coughing as the wind carries it toward them. The choppers have moved in close overhead and their rotor- wash fans the fire, adding to the confusion. FAST HANDHELD PRECEDING RAMBO as he snakes rapidly through the stalks.  He stops.  Hurls a grenade.  Runs on, navigating by instinct in the dense smoke. VINH is knocked down as a grenade detonates near him. A trooper helps him up, sees a figure running nearby... fires.  Hitting one of their own. More grenades.  Random firing.  The din is incredible, the pandemonium absolute. A VIET SOLDIER, reels through the grass.  Obviously a recent conscript, the soldier is probably only 18 years old, and like all Vietnamese, looks even younger.  He is terrified. He stumbles over the body of another trooper.  As he rises, a shape slashes through the grass right in front of him. He has never seen an American, but it looks as monstrous as the descriptions. He raises his AK but Rambo is quicker, kicking it out of his hands.  The kid flops on his butt and finds himself staring up Rambo's rifle barrel.  He closes his eyes and pops into his mouth his BUDDHIST PRAYER MEDALLION, hanging from a chain around his neck.  He bites down and waits for oblivion. When he opens his eyes there is nothing in front of him but grass. Nearby, Vinh leads the retreat as his men fall back, dim shapes rushing blindly through the murk. He staggers, coughing, out of the stand of grass to see Tay, sitting dazed nearby.  Tay gives him an evil smirk. Barking orders like a maniac, Vinh calls for MORTARS to be set up.  Five mortars are positioned.  Elevation set. Mortar bombs poised above the launch tubes.  The helicopters clear off. When the last wounded man is dragged clear, Vinh signals for a sighting round. It EXPLODES beyond the wall of flame.  The mortars open fire. The field explodes seconds later with the first salvo. Earth and shredded grass are hurled skyward.  A second salvo lands.  A third.  And on and on, pulverizing the entire area. EXT.  TREELINE - NEARBY Rambo watches, fascinated by the tremendous destruction unleashed on innocent acreage nearby. He slips slowly into the woods, glancing back frequently at his trail.  He stops occasionally to replace a disturbed twig or leaf, or to rearrange branches when he passes through.  Total \"sterilization.\" The mortars thud on distantly as he creeps away. INT.  INTERROGATION ROOM FULL SHOT as Palyushin delivers a crippling blow to Brewer's ribs.  Brewer cries out hoarsely and slumps. CLOSE ON BREWER as his head slowly rises to look at the big Russian.",

There is a swaying SUSPENSION BRIDGE of rope and woven vines crossing to the jungled slope beyond. Looming at the top of that slope is the ruin of the Wat on its plateau, wreathed in streamers of blowing mist. Not far away is the waterfall, pouring itself into the gorge below. Rambo stops at the far side of the bridge, examining the vine-cables. He starts pulling grenades out of his pockets. EXT.

Rambo removes the tiny BUDDHIST PRAYER MEDALLION from around her neck and puts it on.  Straightens her clothing. Looks up at the broad stone countenance. Its expression is, as always, enigmatic.

Behind him the NAPALM CANISTERS hit the ground at the edge of the ruins. An ENORMOUS FIREBALL blossoms through the jungle. The canisters' inertia carries them forward, SPEWING TWENTY-METER-LONG ARCS OF FLAME.  The inferno engulfs the Buddhas and rolls forward through the trees, silhouetting the tiny running figure of Rambo. Just as the firestorm reaches him he dives at a dead run off an embankment.  Into a rushing MOUNTAIN STREAM about five meters wide. UNDERWATER SEQUENCE Rambo dives to the bottom as a sun-bright CANOPY OF FIRE rushes across the surface with a muffled ROAR. The stream is only about two meters deep and is swiftly flowing.  The napalm on the surface lights the bottom orange despite the daylight.  He seems suspended in a fiery maelstrom. MOVING WITH RAMBO'S figure we dive at giddy speed over the tortuous streambed like some weird amusement park ride. Rambo tumbles over and between smooth boulders. He strains to hold his breath as the fire diminishes above. Then it is gone.  He is clear. Suddenly the rocks END, dropping away. EXT.  RAVINE - WATERFALL Rambo tumbles clear of the falling water as he drops down the face of the CATARACT seen earlier. He hits the surface of the pool with a tremendous SPLASH. ANGLE ON WATER boiling with turbulence as he surfaces, gasping. He weakly sculls at the surface as the current carries him along. Above, on the escarpment, a FIRE-STORM rages, lighting up the jungle. The Buddha is at the heart of the holocaust, reminiscent of a self-immolating monk.  Co's pyre is magnificent. EXT.  BRACKISH ESTUARY The pool at the base of the cataract empties into swampland near the Ca River. Rambo lets the increasingly torpid flow carry him until he catches sight of a familiar object: The abandoned sampan of the river bandits, still moored among the huge tree roots. EXT.  SWAMP - SAMPAN Rambo clambers aboard and goes into the cabin. Still in its wooden locker is the RPG-7 ROCKET GRENADE LAUNCHER and a rack of ROCKETS in a carrying pack. With rapid movements Rambo dons the pack and picks up the launcher.  Moves to the stern.  Pulls hard on the starter rope of the filthy outboard. Across the estuary one of the Hueys is moving over the trees, getting closer.  The motor starts on the third pull. INT./ EXT.  HUEY TWO The VIET PILOT banks, motioning to his door gunner.  Below them is the sampan, chugging across the estuary. The pilot descends as the gunner opens fire.  The .30 caliber slugs riddle the sampan, sending splinters flying. It EXPLODES, its incredible hoard of junk hurled flaming into the swamp. The Huey lowers farther, rotorwash whipping the water into churning froth. The Viets scan the debris, spotting a FLOATING BODY. ANGLE AT WATER LEVEL as the corpse rolls slowly over.  It is Kinh, the crazy bandit leader. EXT.  MARSH - NEARBY WATER LEVEL.  The Huey, hovering 40 meters away, begins to turn toward us. SOMETHING RISES from the surface scum in CLOSE F.G. among the gnarled tree roots. A HULKING FIGURE dripping water and mud and strands of swamp weed. Rambo. The launcher tube across his shoulder. REVERSE - CLOSE ON RAMBO as he wipes filthy water out of his eyes and returns to the SCOPE-SIGHT, blinking, taking his time. WIDER The Huey's M-60 opens up, walking a parade of waterspouts toward him across the water. Rambo FIRES. With a tremendous BACKBLAST the rocket leaps out, a fiery arrow, and strikes the Huey square in the canopy. FLASH!  CRACK!  The Huey drops into the swamp, its rotors twisting up and flying off.  The FUEL TANKS EXPLODE. Rambo pivots, reloading.  He takes aim and fires again. The rocket roars into the rain forest, the blast sending approaching soldiers scattering. He reloads.  Fires again, flinching away from the rocket exhaust.  His expression is grim, his movements methodical. He pivots again.  Fires. Rounds start hitting around him.  He holds position. Reloads. Fires. Beyond the trees, off the river road, the troop trucks are parked.  Nearby is a REFUELING TRUCK for the helicopters. Rambo's rocket makes a direct hit. A FIREBALL BLASTS UP AND OUT, seeming to fill the jungle. INT.  HUEY ONE Palyushin sees the smoke rising from the carnage ahead as he returns with the minigun reloaded. He motions the pilot to hover over the partially submerged wreckage of the other Huey. EXT.  SWAMP WHIP PANNING with Rambo as he sprints along the horizontal trunk of a fallen tree. He vaults off the end. Catches a skid of the hovering Huey with one hand. Palyushin's door gunner swings his sling-mounted \"free 60\" around to bear.  Too late. Rambo's hand shoots up, catches him, pulls him out. INT.  HUEY The pilot feels the weight shift and looks back, seeing Rambo on the skid.  He \"pulls pitch\" hard. The Huey climbs, arcing radically. EXT.  HUEY Rambo slips, dangles. He crashes through the upper branches of a tree as the Huey climbs, banking in a tight arc. The rain forest rolls beneath his dangling legs. He heaves himself up. INT.  HUEY Palyushin lurches out of his seat. He spins in time to see a filthy, bloody and very intense- looking Rambo clambering in the gun door. He rushes Rambo with a kick but Rambo ducks and swings the M-60 door gun on its mount, blocking the Russian. The two lock eyes and square off, crouching in the low compartment. The pilot turns around and gapes in amazement, allowing the craft to sideslip. Palyushin lunges as the Huey pitches wildly. Rambo blocks in a sweeping SHAO-LIN CHUN ROUNDHOUSE, ending in a fierce hammer punch to Palyushin's face. They trade blows and blocks furiously, finally grappling like wrestlers. They crash together into the wall by the minigun AMMO CANISTER.  The Huey yaws and recovers.  Open space roars outside as they strain near the doors, trying desperately to maintain footing on the pitching floor. Palyushin goes half out the door but clings tenaciously, surging back inside. He hammers into Rambo, slamming him mercilessly back. A vicious kick drops Rambo.  The Black Beret grabs his hair and HURLS HIM TWO-HANDED TOWARD THE DOOR. Rambo desperately catches the handles of the door gun, stopping his plunge into space.  His weight swings the gun around in its sling, pointing it into the ship. Completely outside the helicopter, Rambo hangs from the handle with one hand.  Pulls the bolt with the other. And drills a long burst into Palyushin at point blank range, blasting him out the far door in an explosive spray of blood. The pilot turns, terrified, as Rambo advances on him. Rambo eases up beside him, slipping his hand onto the COLLECTIVE STICK. Reaching across he opens the pilot's door.  And FLINGS HIM OUT! EXT.  MARSH A figure tumbles from the low-flying Huey and splashes into the estuary.  The Huey dips and bucks, then rights itself and flies off as the pilot surfaces, gasping.",

A shape, an outline... in the glare of the sun. Tay has a moment of apprehension. Then... EXT.  RAMBO'S HUEY Rambo unleashes the minigun.  The left guard tower VANISHES IN A CLOUD OF FALLING SPLINTERS as thunder rolls across the valley. The Huey pivots nimbly.  The minigun roars again. An orange lightning bolt vaporizes the right tower. VARIOUS ANGLES IN CAMP as the thunder fades. Tay starts to run. The prisoners dive for cover. Three off-duty guards in the guards barracks go for their rifles. They don't make it. FROM RAMBO'S POV The guards barracks seems to disintegrate as the minigun sweeps across it... a SHOCK WAVE OF DESTRUCTION behind which only flying kindling remains. He pivots a last time and annihilates the sentry post with a one-second burst.  Three guards have managed to take cover behind a truck by the main gate.  They begin firing. LOW ANGLE ON THE HUEY, a roaring silhouette in the metallic mist.  The minigun speaks. The truck is ripped open like aluminum foil, shrapnel flying.  The guards CEASE TO EXIST. A spray of red mist and tattered scraps of uniforms settles to the ground. It is all over in seconds. The Huey settles to earth in the center of the compound. Tay, crouching, squints against the rotor blast. Wild-eyed, Capt. Vinh steps from his partially collapsed office and raises his side-arm pistol. Tay snatches it from him with a terrified cry and an expression which says: ARE YOU OUT OF YOUR FUCKING MIND? The Sgt. flings the pistol away and turns toward the Huey. Out of the boiling, blasting dust and smoke a FIGURE EMERGES. To Tay, Rambo is Death incarnate. He is encrusted with dried mud, dried blood, streaked with rivulets of sweat.  His eyes burn. Rambo has detached the door gun from its sling and, with the feed belt over one shoulder, carries it like a rifle. He motions with the muzzle.  Tay and Vinh flop forward, face to the earth, hands laced behind their heads. Rambo moves past them, eyeing the wreckage of the camp warily. INT.  ISOLATION CELL Darkness.
