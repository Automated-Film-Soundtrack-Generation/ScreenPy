The familiar-looking container somersaults halfway down the slope where it bursts open, spilling a confusion of junk. Above the container, a huge drum smashes into a hunk of machinery and splits, oozing an awful looking liquid that spills down onto the contents of the container, sizzling and smoking on steel, eating it like acid. Not far from a smoking piece of steel, WE FIND TODD'S foot protruding from the junk heap!  It's motionless!  Acid drips and hisses. ANGLE ON TODD, sprawled \"inside\" the mountain of junk, grimacing in pain as acid hits his exposed foot.  Trapped in the debris, battered and bloody and weak, he struggles to rise, fights the heavy objects pinning him, fights to avoid the dripping acid.  As the wind SCREAMS furiously, he continues to struggle against the junk that pins him as we... CUT TO: EXT.  \"INSIDE\" AND OUTSIDE THE MOUNTAIN - DAY - A LITTLE LATER TODD's head, caked with blood, appears from the junk like a man looking out of a cave.  Wind seizes at his hair furiously. He looks up, sees four pale suns in the sky...just as a huge steel lathe comes somersaulting down from above like a loose boulder, and TODD has to duck hastily to avoid certain death. As the heavy steel tumbles down the slope below him, wind plucks a twelve-foot I-beam from the slope next to him and whips it off in a frenzy. Holding on for dear life, TODD looks down at the ground four hundred feet below and sees a bleak wasteland strewn with junk shifting and skittering in the wind. He notices something and reacts. Far down on the floor there is a strange pattern of lines...and moving along one of the lines are four tiny FIGURES...they could be humans...but maybe not! For a moment TODD watches them. Then he starts to climb downward through the labyrinth of junk \"inside\" the mountain, and we... CUT TO: EXT.  LOWER ON \"JUNK MOUNTAIN\" - DAY - MINUTES LATER Far down the slope, perhaps forty feet from the foot of the massive mountain, TODD's head pokes out of the confusion of junk and he looks down at the FIGURES below. Seen more closely, the FIGURES are more distinct, but no less mysterious.  Heavy outer garments like huge parkas and hoods blur their individual shapes as they inch across the landscape, apparently clutching one of several crisscrossing wires that stretch tautly for miles across the bleak terrain like \"roads\" through the wind. TODD watches as one of the FIGURES moves off the \"road.\"  He's trailing rope that attaches him to the others as he struggles through the wind, walking almost on all fours like an ape. TODD watches the FIGURE moving among bits of junk until he locates something he wants, picks it up, and starts to struggle back toward the others, dragging his burden after him. TODD is watching what would seem to be some sort of scavenging process by these strange unearthly FIGURES as we... CUT TO: EXT.  FADING SUNS - DUSK - LATER The four suns are changing color, dimming in the sky, as we... CUT TO: EXT.  LANDSCAPE AND \"JUNK MOUNTAIN\" - DUSK Tiny in the distance, the four FIGURES are moving together along a cable, headed away from the junk mountain. At ground level now, TODD is watching them, crouched behind a massive transformer that teeters slightly in the wind in spite of its great bulk. Peeking around the sheltering transformer, he spots one of the taut cables lashed to an enormous piece of junk near the foot of \"his\" mountain.  The cable is twenty yards away in a \"canyon\" of junk and he'll have to move across open space partially exposed to the wind in order to get to it. He starts out from behind the transformer... WHOOOOOO!  Screaming wind lifts him and hurls him thirty feet, his arms flailing.  He comes down even further from the cable, struggling to keep on his feet.  Gritting his teeth, he fights the wind, struggles toward the cable. Suddenly a chunk of steel whips at him and he ducks just in time as it whistles close to his head. TODD drops to the ground and starts to crawl \"under the wind,\" toward the taut cable, and we... CUT TO: EXT.  \"STEEL HENGE\" - DUSK - LATER Seen by TODD, the four tiny FIGURES are far ahead, disappearing in the distance and the dusk. Following them on a taut wire, TODD is passing through a barren landscape punctuated by strange ruins, great shapes of steel thrusting out of the ground and looming over and around him, vaguely recognizable as the wreckage of a space vehicle that must have crashed long ago. The mountains of junk squat a mile behind him.  He's come a long way, it's almost dark, he's weak. He hangs onto the wire, walking with effort. He can no longer see the creatures ahead of him on the wire. He notices something thirty yards off the wire to the right. Steel crosses.  Maybe a hundred of them.  A cemetery. Just then, the wind catches TODD, yanks him, but he hangs onto the wire, holding on desperately, as the wind pulls at him and makes him flap like a pennant in the breeze. Then the wind dies enough for him to get both hands on the wire and get weakly to his feet.  For a moment he looks like he might collapse, but he doesn't, and we... CUT TO: EXT.  LANDSCAPE - NIGHT At night the four suns glow darkly like night lights. TODD is alone on the planet, punished by the savage wind, struggling along the wire, shivering. Every stop is an effort, but the eyes stare into the dark and they reveal no emotion, not even when he suddenly tenses, seeing something ahead. In the distance a faint light glows. TODD considers it as we... CUT TO: EXT.  WINDOW/SKYLIGHT - NIGHT - MOMENTS LATER The window is detached plexi from some kind of vehicle, embedded in a low mound of \"earth\" like a skylight.  Whatever is making the light comes from below in a sort of hut that slopes only inches above the ground. TODD is hanging onto the cable only ten yards from the strange window.  He can see more of them glowing all around him, as well as silhouetted pipes issuing smoke to the wind. TODD drops to his belly to keep under the wind.  He crawls ten yards to the window and pears through it. TODD'S POV of a fantastic confusion of color and movement seen through the thick scratched plexiglass window.  The wild blurs of activity make no sense to him whatsoever, nor do the very FAINT SQUEALS of sound barely audible over the deafening ROAR of the wind. (What he's seeing in the room below is a violent pillow fight between eight BOYS and GIRLS ranging from four to ten years old. Wearing cotton shifts dyed red, blue, or yellow they're smacking each other violently with rag pillows and laughing happily in a dormitory-style full of stacked bunks.) ANGLE ON TODD, prone on the \"roof,\" mystified.  He's never seen anything like it.  His grease-covered face barely reveals his puzzlement when he is suddenly distracted by a change in the wind. The ROARING WIND that has dominated the environment since he first arrived has diminished to a strong breeze. TODD tries sitting up.  The breeze doesn't overpower him.  He looks around. The meaningless SHRIEKS of the pillow fight, though still muffled by heavy plexiglass, are LOUDER now, but TODD's attention is on the other window/skylight that glows from this strange \"roof\" and on the strange sound that's coming to him, borne on the breeze... a MUSICAL sound. Struggling weakly to his feet, TODD staggers toward the next window.  The MUSIC is LOUDER as he approaches -- it's waltz music played on an accordion. TODD drops to his knees and peers through the next window. TODD'S POV through the second \"window,\" another mysterious vision!  The color and movement are more subdued, but TODD is just as puzzled. What he's seeing indistinctly through the thick plexiglass is an OVERHEAD VIEW of a man and a woman gliding across the floor, moving as one, first this way, then that, in time to a WALTZ.  In the corner, another person is making a strange movement that seems to initiate the music... ANGLE ON TODD, flat on the roof.  Now that the weak breeze has given way to a deathly stillness, the mysterious (to him) MUSIC is clearly audible as TODD peers through the plexiglass at the warm scene below, as puzzled by the waltzing couple as by the pillow fights. Then he gets to his feet again and in the stillness makes his way past a smoking chimney toward the next window.  Halfway there he freezes...listening! A strange haunting WHISTLING sound is coming from somewhere... TODD looks around at the blackness beyond the roof windows. There's nothing visible... The mysterious sound is louder now, drowning out the music ominously, drowning out everything, everything, everything. Suddenly TODD understands, but he's too late... ROOOOOOOOOOAAR!  It's the WIND, back with renewed fury, more powerful than ever! TODD is hurtled into the air, tossed head over heels by the wind, struggling, clutching at empty air in vain, buffeted, slammed to the ground, lifted again before he can flatten himself, tossed violently, somersaulted helplessly... EXT.  INSIDE A TRENCH WHAM!  TODD is slammed face first to the ground.  For a long moment he's motionless, untouched by the HOWLING WIND for reasons that aren't clear. Finally he rolls over weakly and looks up. In the weak light he can just make out the steep earthen walls of a narrow trench looming eight feet straight up, protecting him from the wind howling overhead. TODD tries to get up...but the fall has injured his leg and he slumps to the floor of the three-foot-wide trench, too weak and injured even to crawl. Lying there, barely conscious, gasping for breath, he suddenly sees something. Shoes!  Less than a foot from his bloody face. He manages to lift his head a little and look up. Silhouetted by the light spilling from an open door in the trench wall are four children...ELLEN, ten, WILL, six, TOMMY, five, and JOHNNY, eight. Barely conscious, TODD can just make out the astonishment on their blurred shadowy faces as they look down at him in amazement.  Then they go OUT OF FOCUS altogether as TODD slumps unconscious and everything goes BLACK BLACK BLACK, and we... CUT TO: INT.  MEETING ROOM - NIGHT VOICES, CONFUSION.  About fifty people are jammed into the low- ceilinged meeting room, all of them talking at once.  They are PIONEERS, men and women of all ages and many races, a hardy, weathered-looking group dressed in plain clothes of muted color. Their faces seem to have been etched by the wind with deep lines, the skin burnished, and even the younger ones have crow's feet around the eyes from squinting. As they chatter excitedly, asking each other what happened, who found him, where, and so on, a sharp-faced fifty-ish woman, HAWKINS, is standing behind a table in the front of the room, calling for order.",

He draws his face back enough to avoid being touched. NATHAN looks unsure.  He's used to affection.  Then he realizes... it must be a game!  He reaches out again... Again TODD avoids the touch...and as he does so, something catches his eye. TODD sees a VIPER sliding across the floor toward NATHAN. NATHAN doesn't see it; he's still trying to figure out this game. TODD pulls off his boot and hands it to NATHAN. NATHAN accepts it, thinks it's a gift.  He's pleased.  It's that kind of game!  He gives TODD a friendly \"thanks for the boot\" smile. TODD points to the VIPER which is close to NATHAN now. NATHAN looks at the VIPER.  He doesn't understand what he's supposed to do. TODD makes a hitting motion with his hand. The VIPER is close to NATHAN, coiling. NATHAN looks from the VIPER to TODD. TODD indicates the VIPER with his eyes.  His look is intense, a message in his eyes. The VIPER is like a spring, it strikes... TODD's hand is like a blur, almost invisible as he catches the snake and flips it a couple of feet. NATHAN stares. The angry VIPER SPITS and HISSES and coils to strike again. NATHAN looks at TODD. TODD eyes the boot, then indicates the VIPER with his eyes. NATHAN frowns; he's getting the idea. The VIPER is about to strike again... SQUASH!  A heavy boot comes down on the snake, crushing it. TODD looks up to see MACE standing on the snake, reaching down for NATHAN.

TODD rises out of the water only five feet away like a demon. Before NEW SOLDIER THREE can cry out, TODO lunges at him. EXT.  JUNK TERRAIN As he creeps cautiously through the gloom, NEW SOLDIER ONE stiffens.  Was that a stifled CRY?  Or not? NEW SOLDIER ONE signals NEW SOLDIER TWO and the two of them turn and move cautiously toward where NEW SOLDIER THREE was. EXT.  INSIDE THE TRENCH TODD'S light reveals NEW SOLDIER THREE slumped in the water, his head askew, neck broken, eyes vacant.  TODD is hastily rummaging through the soldier's equipment, looking for something. He finds it. EXT.  JUNK TERRAIN NEW SOLDIERS ONE and TWO are approaching the trench when suddenly a flare bursts above them. The NEW SOLDIERS react with amazement as the flare exposes them in a brightly illuminated landscape.  Before they can take cover... BUDDA BUDDA BUDDA.  Flashes of fire from the lip of the trench. NEW SOLDIER ONE drops dead, NEW SOLDIER TWO is down and writhing on the ground, SCREAMING. ANGLE ON CRAWLER ONE veering sharply toward the trench, accelerating, FIRING ROCKETS, CANONS, MACHINE GUNS.... ANGLE ON THE OTHER NEW SOLDIERS, prone, firing toward the trench. EXT.  INSIDE THE TRENCH Tracers whizzing over the top of the trench illuminate TODD as he races down the trench, running for his life. EXT.  JUNK TERRAIN Still firing, CRAWLER ONE grinds up to the lip of the trench. ANGLE ON NEW SOLDIERS charging toward the trench behind the CRAWLER. CLOSE ON CRAWLER ONE'S HOOD where a small trap opens and a nozzle pops out like a little penis and...SQUIRTS a stream of liquid! The liquid stream arcs fifty yards along the trench and diminishes backward like a man pissing... INT.  INSIDE THE TRENCH TODD looks back just before be rounds a corner in the trench, sees the liquid hitting the water in the trench. Sheltered from their view by the turn in the trench, TODD tries to scale the steep wall of the trench. WHOOOOOOOOOSH!  The surface of the water-filled trench bursts into flame.  A fiery river of flammable liquid. ANGLE ON NEW SOLDIERS reacting to something! NEW SOLDIERS' POV of TODD, visible in the firelight as he rolls over the lip of the trench fifty yards from them. ANGLE ON THE NEW SOLDIERS firing as they move toward TODD. They've got him now! ANGLE ON TODD bellying toward a rusting turbine, disappearing from view. ANGLE ON CRAWLER ONE, separated from TODD'S hideout by the trench, pouring heavy FIRE on the spot where TODD disappeared. ANGLE ON NEW SOLDIERS communicating by hand signals as they move to surround TODD. EXT.  BEHIND THE TURBINE As rockets and canon shells SLAM into the turbine, TODD hastily attends to a nasty wound in the flesh his thigh, bandaging it skillfully, quickly. EXT.  JUNK TERRAIN While CRAWLER ONE keeps TODD pinned down, NEW SOLDIERS move to outflank him. EXT.  BEHIND THE TURBINE As TODD completes dressing his thigh, the CRAWLER stops firing. Silence. TODD peers out, assessing the situation. TODD'S POV of the terrain.  Vague glimpses of NEW SOLDIERS slipping from cover to cover, never exposing themselves enough for a shot. ANGLE ON TODD.  He seems to know he's in a tight spot.  He's preparing to fight off an attack, laying out weapons, grenades, when...he freezes.  Listens. Behind the stillness he can hear the faint WHISTLE that precedes the wind. Hastily TODD yanks his belt off. EXT.  TERRAIN NEW SOLDIER FOUR sticks his head up from behind an old boiler and signals NEW SOLDIER FIVE. ANGLE ON NEW SOLDIER FIVE acknowledging from the mouth of an old storage tank where he's positioned. ANGLE ON NEW SOLDIER SIX bellying toward TODD'S position. EXT.  BEHIND THE TURBINE Using his belt and a carabiner as a safety line, TODD attaches himself to the heavy turbine...and gathers up his weapons.  He can HEAR the very low WHISTLING building ever so slightly. EXT.  TERRAIN The WIND SIGHS and a faint breeze stirs.  Then a tin can skitters by in a puff of wind as the NEW SOLDIERS take turns moving closer to TODD, flanking him from safe vantage points. NEW SOLDIER FOUR stands to wave the next man forward when... WHOOOOOOOOOOOOOSH!  THE WIND ERUPTS, ROARS, BELLOWS... NEW SOLDIER FOUR is lifted into the air and carried away. NEW SOLDIER FIVE is trying to stay on his feet, as the wind SLAMS him into one piece of junk after another. INT./EXT.  CRAWLER As the wind HOWLS and shakes the CRAWLER, the DRIVER and the GUNNER stare with amazement as NEW SOLDIER FIVE slams into their windshield, neck broken, and stares at them with lifeless eyes. They see NEW SOLDIERS SIX and SEVEN tumble and somersault past. As NEW SOLDIER SIX disappears, blown off into the night, NEW SOLDIER SEVEN manages to grab hold of the walking wire. Gripping the wire for his life, he turns just in time to be decapitated by a piece of aluminum housing flying through the air. EXT.  TERRAIN NEW SOLDIER FOUR, badly battered, is down on his belly trying to stay \"under the wind\" when he sees something terrible! HIS POV of a massive lathe blowing right toward him along the ground, tumbling, crashing, slamming into things.  It looms over him, unavoidable, the end! ANGLE ON NEW SOLDIER FOUR reacting to the huge lathe about to crush him. EXT.  BEHIND THE TURBINE Held by his safety belt and protected by the turbine, TODD peers out, and watches the wind destroy the footsoldiers. TODD'S POV OF NEW SOLDIER FIVE's lifeless body being blown along the ground like a leaf. ANGLE ON TODD, reacting.  He's seen something important. TODD'S POV of CRAWLER ONE moving again, rounding the far end of the trench and, no longer separated by the trench, turning toward TODD'S position. INT.  CRAWLER ONE As the DRIVER steers, the GUNNER peers through his scope. GUNNER'S INFRARED POV of TODD darting behind an overturned vat.",

MELTON hits him again and TODD loses his grip on the chain, starts to fall, grabs at the chain, clutches, slides... ANGLE ON MELTON, CRUNCH!, hit as he swings at MELTON.  WHAM! MELTON hits him again, hard. GOINES swings against MELTON from behind, smashing at him with his free hand and with both feet. MELTON ignores the blows from behind as he grabs ROMERO by the face with one hand, yanks the face close to his own, and squeezes mercilessly. ANGLE ON TODD, TWENTY FEET BELOW.  He's managed to get a foothold on one of the mini-platforms.  His face horribly bloody, he looks up at the action twenty feet above him and sees MELTON suddenly hurl ROMERO downward. ROMERO rockets down past TODD... ANGLE ON THE FLOOR as SMASH!  ROMERO's body crunches against the cement not far from RUBRICK, SLOAN, and CHURCH, splattering them with blood. Their eyes are wide with disbelief and horror as they look up again... ANGLE ON MELTON in the girders as he turns to face the man who's been clubbing him from behind...GOINES! GOINES swings his chain wide and MELTON, eyes merciless, deadly, swings after him. ANGLE ON TODD, bloody, struggling up the chain hand over hand. His eyes follow MELTON above as the new soldier swings and swings, trying to get a blow at GOINES. Just then, GOINES lunges at MELTON, SMACK, SMASH, he hits him hard, and WHAM!  MELTON hits him back... ANGLE ON TODD who has climbed to a \"platform\" foothold on his chain five feet above the swinging fighters.  TODD looks down on MELTON's back as the big man swings close, watching, tensing, then... TODD dives off his chain and lands on MELTON's back, crooking one arm around the new soldier's neck and pounding him with one free hand and strangling him with the other arm. MELTON gurgles while GOINES hits him in the face. ANGLE ON MEKUM WATCHING BELOW.  For the first time a frown of concern wrinkles his brow. ANGLE ON MELTON AND TODD on chains just below the girders. MELTON slams an elbow back into TODD's ribs hard and TODD gasps for air, but... GOINES uses the moment to slam a knee into MELTON's balls and... MELTON gasps, then grabs GOINES by the neck with one hand, rips him from the chain, and sends him plunging violently downward even as... TODD goes for face with his free hand. SLAM!  MELTON smashes TODD in the ribs with an elbow. TODD savagely gouges out one of MELTON's eyes. ANGLE ON MEKUM, sixty feet below, enraged at the sight of MELTON's injury. ANGLE ON THE VETERANS watching the brutal fight with blank impassive faces, RILEY among them. ANGLE ON THE NEW SOLDIERS watching, robot-like. ANGLE ON THE STRUGGLE OVERHEAD.  SMASH!  SMASH!  SMASH!  MELTON's elbows drive back into TODD's ribs.  The breath knocked out of him, TODD gasps for air, pain contorting his face. MELTON manages to get TODD's forearm into his mouth and bites furiously, drawing blood. TODD grits his teeth in pain. WHAM!  Another blow to the ribs from MELTON's elbow. TODD is losing his grip. RILEY watches below, his face a mask. MELTON bites and elbows furiously. TODD loses his grip and grabs at MELTON, rakes flesh as he begins to fall and then... Plunging downward, TODD grabs wildly at the chain and catches it ...but he keeps falling, the chain ripping flesh from his hand for twenty feet until... He can't hold on any longer!  TODD plunges the last thirty feet to the floor, landing with a terrible crunch right on top of ROMERO's broken body below. Sudden silence! ANGLE ON THE VETERANS watching impassively as TODD lies motionless, sprawled on ROMERO's body. ANGLE ON THE NEW SOLDIERS revealing no feelings. ANGLE ON CHURCH, SLOAN, and RUBRICK looking stunned and shaken. It's MEKUM who breaks the silence, SCREAMING furiously at the one- eyed MELTON who's still sixty feet up...",

She picks up NATHAN from where he's sitting near TODD's feet and carries him to the door, giving him a kiss, then handing him to ELLEN. NATHAN starts to cry and holds his arms out to his mother as ELLEN hugs him and comforts him. TODD watches the drama as ELLEN and SANDRA comfort the child and soothe his fears at being separated from his mother. Nothing shows in TODD's eyes...but affection seems to fascinate him. As ELLEN and her cohorts hurry off with NATHAN, they sneak over- the-shoulder glances at the strange monster, TODD. Just then MACE, dressed in a heavy parka also, comes out of the bedroom and heads for the door.",

HAWKINS watches for a long moment, her eyes worried.

One of the pioneers, CHESTER, shouts, points. They all see JIMMY PIG being blown faster than he can run, his legs churning desperately to keep up with his wind-propelled body.  To no avail!  He's suddenly airborne, his legs still churning like cartoon legs as he flaps helplessly at the end of his safety tether like a kite, fifty feet in the air. An eighty-pound steel barrel blows past, tumbling in the wind. Bits of junk zip dangerously around like missiles. ANGLE ON THE PIONEERS, crouched low on their knees against the wind, clutching the wire with one hand while they pull on JIMMY PIG'S safety line.  But the wind is too strong...until suddenly TODD is pulling, and TODD'S strength makes the difference... slowly JIMMY PIG is pulled toward them...and Pioneers exchange amazed glances at TODD'S strength. As he pulls, TODD notices what the others don't... ANGLE ON THE RIFLE dropped by JIMMY PIG, ten yards away. ANGLE ON JIMMY PIG as he's hauled safely in to the group of PIONEERS who clap him on the back and hug him.  CHESTER is laughing so hard he can barely stand up as he tries to describe and mimic JIMMY'S desperate effort to outrun the force of the wind...",

JIMMY PIG in a fake beard and a fake stomach?  This is the craziest shit TODD has ever encountered. ANGLE ON NATHAN, a wrapped present in hand.  He hasn't a clue what it is or what he should do with it. Laughing, MACE and SANDRA hover over him, showing him how to pull the wrapping off.  Great idea!  NATHAN likes pulling wrapping off!  That's fun.  SANDRA and MACE watch joyfully as NATHAN tears at the wrapping enthusiastically. ANGLE ON TODD getting to his feet. ANGLE ON NATHAN pulling away the last of the wrapping to expose a pull toy, a METAL BIRD on crude wheels made of wire and junk. MACE takes the toy, demonstrates pulling it.  The wings flap as the wheels turn! NATHAN reacts with delight and amazement!  Then grabs it! A SUDDEN SCREECH... ANGLE ON TODD looking alarmed.  He's on his way to the door, but EMMA is charging at him, SHRIEKING!!! Not sure whether this is an attack or not, TODD watches the older woman scramble onto a stool next to him, still SHRIEKING giddily. As TODD eyes her (and everybody else) warily, she gives him a peck on the cheek and points over head. TODD looks up, sees a strange cloth decoration with a sign on it that says \"MISTLETOE.\" Means nothing to TODD.  There's a burst of applause as EMMA scrambles off the stool.  Somebody starts to sing \"GOD REST YE MERRY GENTLEMEN.\" A MONTAGE OF FACES:  JIMMY \"SANTA\" PIG, MACE, SANDRA, RED, CHESTER, SALLY, ELLEN, HAWKINS, even SLADE, SINGING. ANGLE ON THE DOOR.

Out of the darkness beside him, TODD looms. RILEY looks into the face of a man he saw killed! TODD has a CHILD in each arm and another hanging on to his leg for dear life.  He's wearing the scarf Jimmy Pig gave him. In the shadows behind TODD, JIMMY PIG, SLADE, EMMA, JUDITH and more CHILDREN are watching anxiously. RILEY's stone face comes as close to expression as it ever will...astonishment! The other VETERANS stare too, amazed. Suddenly RILEY gives TODD a smart military salute.
