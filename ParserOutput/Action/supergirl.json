Instantly transparent bubble forms around her. Her parents watch as she floats away. She passes into an air lock through the membrane that surrounds the City, and off into an infinity of space. MONTAGE: THE JOURNEY OF KARA INSIDE \"HER SPHERE FROM THE INNER DIMENSION TO OUR WORLD. Her sphere moves from blackness, to a dark green limbo. The atmosphere thickens around her. Soon it is unmistakably water, and she is heading toward the light above. A fish darts past with a flash of silver. The sphere rushes upward faster and faster. It breaks the surface of the , water. Kara springs free of the bubble, which disappears. She is now wearing a blue and red costume like her cousin Superman. She lands on a nearby beach. EXT. EARTH.  BEACH BESIDE THE SEA. SUNRISE She looks around her, feasting with her eyes on the details of this new exciting world. Kara bends down and picks up a stone from the ground at her feet. To her astonishment, she crushes it to powder in her hand, and blows the fine dust away with a blast of superbreath. She looks down at her feet, so firmly planted on the ground. She rises a few inches into the air, and reacts with amazement. Then she looks up into the blue sky overhead and her expression of astonishment is replaced by a look of joyous longing. With a sudden impulse she shoots straight upward. EXT. HIGH ABOVE THE EARTH.  DAY Kara loops and rolls, swoops and circles, laughing with sheer delight. EXT. HIGH ABOVE MOUNTAIN MEADOWS.  HORSES.  DAY Kara swoops down at a herd of horses. The herd parts and gallops off in all directions as she pulls out of her dive and flies away. CUT TO: EXT. MOUNTAINTOP.  DAY Kara lands on a mountaintop and admires the view. The she bends down and scoops up a handful of snow. She stares at it with awe. INSERT. MICROSCOPIC SHOT OF SNOW CRYSTALS IN ALL THEIR INFINITE VARIETY AND BEAUTY. BACK TO SCENE.  DAY Kara stands up, smiling. She flies into the air again. EXT. FOREST.  DAY She lands and walks among the huge trunks of a primeval forest. Shafts of sunlight pierce the gloom. These trees are much more impressive than Zaltar's imitation back in Argo City. She hears a mournful sound and pulls back a spray of brambles. She sees a BABY DEER hopelessly tangled in the long canes. She shoots RAYS OF HEAT VISION from her eyes and slices through the tough stems. The fawn scrambles free, and scampers off into the forest. Kara watches it with a benevolent smile. She removes a brunette wig and some street clothing from a secret pocket in her cape. EXT. MANSION --- GARDEN PARTY A big impressive house somewhere in the Middle West. People mill about on the neatly manicured lawn sipping drinks and snagging hors d'oeuvres off silver trays from. passing waiters. All the quests have a name tag on, like at some kind of conference. SELENA, the blonde who discovered the Power Source, is circulating among the quests. She has changed since we saw her last. No longer the girl next door, she now wears a fabulous designer dress dripping with jewels. She walks with the regal air of someone used to being obeyed, and graciously accepts the homage of the quests. A smile, a nod, a kind word from her leaves them all basking in the warm afterglow of her attention. But we notice odd details of the party: the decorations are all based on mystic occult symbols. At the refreshment table, there is a big ten-foot WICKER SCULPTURE OF A FEMALE GOAT covered with paper flowers. And the quests all have an indefinable air of strangeness about them. BIANCA, a tall cold-eyed brunette in black silk dress, whispers in Selena's ear . BIANCA Be careful. Nigel is going to try something.",

Selena steps up onto a raised dais. And holds up her hands in an invocational gesture. SELENA Thank you, sisters and brothers of the Craft. It is a great honor you have given me, and I will try to be worthy. And when my secret plans are revealed -- you will learn that we are on the threshold of power and influence undreamed of when Nigel was our leader. More applause. One of the cooks applauding at the refreshment table knocks over a fuel-pot under a chafing dish. The fuel-pot falls on the ground at the base of the wicker goat statue. SELENA And now, ,I call upon the Great Mother--the spirit of Nature --- to bless all our endeavors in the coming year... A woman in the .audience screams. Everyone looks where, she is pointing. The huge ten-foot tall wicker statue ,bursts into flames. Panic and pandemonium. Some of the quests run for safety. Others try to throw water onto the blazing, torch-like statue, but in vain. Selena frowns at the spectacle, and, without a word, turns and stalks into her house. INT. SELENA'S HOUSE.  LIVING ROOM THE CAMERA FOLLOWS Selena through the French doors and into her large living room. On one wall is a huge, ornate gold-framed MIRROR, covered with a thick veil. Selena sits down in front of a large hearth, and opens a secret compartment in the floor. She reaches inside and removes a finely wrought METAL BOX IN THE SHAPE OF A GARGOYLE and a pack of cards. She puts the gargoyle box on her lap, and begins to cast tarot cards onto the floor in mystic patterns. The Elderly Man in the pinstripe suit enters from the garden. Outside the excited shouts and sounds of firefighting can still be heard. Someone runs by in the b.g. with a coil of garden hose. The Elderly Man walks over to Selena, timidly. ELDERLY MAN Is this Nigel's doing? SELENA It's a warning, that's for sure.",

I can't read the signs worth spit. EXT. MIDVALE SCHOOL. DAY A bus stops in front of the school. Kara, disguised in a brunette wig and unfashionable clothing gets out of the bus. (From now on we shall refer to her in human guise by the name of her secret identity LINDA LEE.) Linda walks up the driveway toward the main building. Around her the campus is full of girls all in the school uniform of skirt, blazer, and white knee socks. Many of them stare frankly at the new girl in the slightly dowdy dress, carrying a battered old suitcase. In front of the school, LUCY LANE, one of the older girls, is batting in a softball game. She swings and hits one over the fence for a homer. Linda watches the excited, deliriously happy girls---wondering if she will ever be able to share such strong group emotions. Linda walks up the steps to the main building. INT. MAIN BUILDING. MIDVALE SCHOOL. STAIRWAY Linda walks up the long stairway in the entrance hall. MYRA, the school bully, passes with her spy and toady the loathsome MUFFY. As they pass MYRA speaks in a loud voice. MYRA Geeze, another barfy new student. They're really scraping the bottom of the barrel these days. Linda walks on up to the next f1oor. INT. MAIN BUILDING . MIDVALE SCHOOL. HALL Linda walks along the deserted hall and stops at the office of the registrar, MR. Danvers. She enters. INT. REGISTRAR'S OFFICE MR. Danvers turns from his desk and glares at her. MR. DANVERS Don't you believe in knocking? LINDA Oh, yes. Knocking. The pre-entry signal. I forgot. She knocks on the open door. Her manner is so open and guileless that MR. Danvers, though he gives her a strange look, does not put it down to smart-aleckyness, as he normally would. MR. DANVERS What can I do for you?",

DAY Linda and Lucy (seen from the shoulders up) are enjoying a nice warm shower. Linda looks through the tile wall (with her x-ray vision) and sees Myra next door, fooling with the plumbing. INT. PLUMBING ROOM MYRA (whispering) Are they in? Muffy (Myra's spy) nods yes from her look-out position. MYRA Listen to the screams when I shut off the cold water. She takes a huge wrench and starts to shut off a valve. Her spy looks worriedly at the valve. MUFFY But, Myra, why don't you shut off the hot water and give them an ice bath? If you shut off the cold it, could scald them. MYRA So they lose a little skin. Serve 'em right. Myra pulls on the wrench. INT. SHOWER Linda shoots a beam of her heat vision through the wall. INT. PLUMBING ROOM Myra pulls on the valve, but the wrench glows red hot in her hand. She lets go with a cry of pain. A pipe springs a leak, drenching her in her school uniform. Myra heads for the door, to get out. More pipes spring leaks. Myra is soaked, her hair all bedraggled, her uniform a mess. CUT TO: INT. COMPUTING CLASS MR. Danvers is putting a fairly complicated equation on the blackboard. All the students sit at the consoles of little personal computers staring at their blank monitor screens. Except for Linda, who is staring intently at the wall on one side of the classroom. MR DANVERS Now, this is the kind of problem that used to take weeks before the computer. It still takes a long time without certain algorithms. Linda stares out through the solid wall with her X-RAY vision. EXT. CAMPUS A cat is stalking along a branch of a tree toward a nest of little baby birds. The nest is wedged on top of a window cornice on one of the buildings, but the tree branch passes just close enough by it for the cat to grab the baby birds when he gets there. Slowly the cat inches along the branch. Suddenly a beam of light hits the branch. It bursts into flame, and falls down to the ground, saving the birds from any future danger. The cat turns around like a felon caught in the act, runs down the tree trunk, and scampers away. INT. CLASS Linda smiles to herself. MR. DANVERS (O.S.) Linda? Are you with us? She turns to look at MR. Danvers and finds everyone in class staring at her. LINDA Uh, yes, MR. Danvers. She looks at the board. LINDA The answer is 5,271,009,010. Linda smiles, proud that she got the right answer. The other girls in the class laugh at her. Even her friend Lucy snickers. Linda realizes she has made a mistake, but is not sure how serious it is. The class bell rings and the girls dash for the exit. Linda stays in her seat staring at Mr. Danvers as he goes around the room switching off the computers. MR. DANVERS You may go, Linda. But try not to clown around in the future. She meekly heads for the door. He turns to erase the blackboard. Something stays his hand, and he looks at the problem. Then he puts down the eraser and starts to copy the problem on a piece of paper. EXT. ROAD OUTSIDE SCHOOL. DAY Selena's Cadillac drives past the school. softball in front. Girls are playing softball in front. INT. CADILLAC Bianca is driving. Selena sits in the back brooding. Her tarot cards and the metal gargoyle box are beside her on the open counter of a  built-in bar. She suddenly calls out to Bianca. SELENA Stop the car! Bianca jams on the brakes and the car screeches to a halt. EXT. ROAD OUTSIDE SCHOOL The girls stop their softball game and turn to stare at the Cadillac. INT. CADILLAC Selena is gathering up her scattered things from the floor of the car. SELENA I said stop, I didn't say run into a brick wall.",

Linda's bed' across the room is austere and almost monastic, with no family photos, posters, or toys. LUCY Hey, Linda, you in there? LINDA (o.s.) Uh-huh. Linda answers from inside the shut bathroom door. LUCY How much longer you gonna be? LINDA (o.s.) Not long. I'm cutting my hair. Lucy crosses to the bathroom door. LUCY You're a maniac! Let me do it for you. You'll look awful. INT. BATHROOM OFF DORM ROOM. DAY Linda is in her Supergirl costume and her blonde hair. Her brunette wig is hanging on a hook beside the mirror. SUPERGIRL I can manage, thanks. Supergirl holds out a lock of her blonde hair. She looks into the mirror and SHOOTS A BEAM OF ENERGY FROM HER EYE, which reflects off the mirror and strikes her hair, cutting off one inch of the blonde strand. INT.

And more than we can imagine. Be careful, Kara. And come home safely. The sun sets and the beam of light disappears as if a switch had been snapped off, leaving Linda alone in the warm afterglow of twilight. The soft strains of girls harmonizing float down the hall. GIRLS (o.s.) \"...mid pleasures and palaces Where'ere I roam, Be it ever so humble, There's no place like home.\" CUT TO: EXT. SCHOOL GROUNDS. BENCH. DAY Linda sits by herself reading on a stone bench: She is wearing the school uniform now. All around her girls are running out of the dorm with overnight cases and climbing into cars driven by middle-aged couples. There is a frantic bustle of activity. CUT TO: INT. OFFICE IN THE MATH DEPARTMENT Mr. Danvers sits at his computer, which is spewing out page after page of a complicated printout. Finally the printer stops. He reads out the bottom line. MR . DANVERS Five billion, two hundred and seventy-one million, nine thousand, and ten. He sits back in his chair and puffs thoughtfully on his pipe. EXT. SCHOOL GROUNDS. BENCH. DAY. LATER The campus is deserted. Linda still pretends to read, but her sense of loneliness is palpable. Suddenly Mr. Danvers is beside her, looking down. MR. DANVERS No plans for the weekend, Linda? LINDA No, MR. Danvers. MR. DANVERS Can't have you moping around the campus. Why don't you come home with us for dinner? LINDA I'd love to. DISSOLVE TO: EXT. BACKYARD OF DANVERS'S HOUSE. DAY Mr. & Mrs. Danvers and Linda sit outside under the trees at a table piled high with delicious home cooked food. ,The dog begs for scraps. As the scene progresses (MOS) the Danvers bring Linda out of her shyness until they all laugh together sharing food, jokes and happiness. A. dreamlike moment of nostalgia from everyone's childhood. INT. SELENA'S HOUSE. LIVING ROOM. DAY Selena, at her most glamorous, in silk hostess pajamas and scads of pearls, stands looking out the French, doors of her mansion. She is staring shamelessly at ETHAN, a handsome young landscape gardener. Bianca is standing beside Selena. BIANCA Is he your entertainment for tonight?",

She climbs bravely up into the driver's seat and tries to tug at the controls. They are frozen. In desperation Lucy yanks on the steering wheel. The bulldozer turns ninety degrees into the gas station. EXT. GAS STATION. NIGHT A TOURIST is filling his station wagon at one of the self-service pumps. His WIFE is bringing their TODDLER back from the rest rooms. The bulldozer suddenly smashes into the gas pumps and through the gas station. The tourist dives out of its path. The bulldozer circles behind the gas station toward a small motel next door, leaving in its wake a totaled station wagon, and gasoline leaking on the ground from the smashed pumps. EXT. HAMBURGER RESTAURANT. NIGHT Linda watches with mounting horror. And yet she remembers the warning from Alura, and stands frozen, unable to intervene. EXT. MOTEL/GAS STATION. NIGHT Lucy fights the wheel in vain. The bulldozer circles through the motel, smashing the individual cabins into matchsticks. The bulldozer drives under the MOTEL SIGN which HITS LUCY ON THE HEAD, KNOCKING HER UNCONSCIOUS. Finally, the bulldozer comes full circle and halts against a utility pole next to the gas station. The utility pole leans at a crazy angle. Its ELECTRIC WIRES break and dangle down, flashing blue arcs of electricity where they touch the pavement. The RIVER OF GASOLINE from the broken pump flows inexorably toward the arcing power lines. The mother kneels beside her dazed husband and looks over at her toddler running toward the arcing wires, his arms held out eagerly. MOTHER My baby!!!!! Instead of helping, the onlookers turn and flee the inevitable fire. EXT. HAMBURGER RESTAURANT. NIGHT Linda can't take it any longer. She ducks into the deserted hamburger restaurant. An instant later, she emerges through a skylight in the roof in red and blue costume as SUPERGIRL! She stands on-the roof in front of a big illuminated advertising sign, which hides her from the fleeing crowd. Supergirl takes a deep breath and blows with her super lungs:. The toddler is blown safely 1nto his mother's arms. MOTHER My baby. She grasps the child in her arms and helps her husband hobble to safety just as the river of gasoline reaches the sparking wires and BURSTS INTO FLAMES . The bulldozer, with Lucy Lane unconscious at the controls and Ethan imprisoned in the scoop, is surrounded by an IMPENETRABLE RING OF FIRE . Supergirl dashes through the ring of fire so fast that if there were any spectators who weren't running for their lives she would only be visible as a red and blue streak. EXT. ACCIDENT SCENE/GAS STATION. NIGHT INSIDE THE RING OF FIRE. Supergirl takes the unconscious Lucy from the driver's seat and carries her in her arms to the front of the bulldozer. Supergirl pulls open the massive metal jaws with one hand like they were sheet rubber. INT. SCOOP OF BULLDOZER Ethan looks up as Supergirl slides Lucy Lane in beside him. He sees Supergirl's face backlit by the raging inferno outside. SUPERGIRL Everything's going to be all right. She's just unconscious. No broken bones. INSERT ETHAN'S P.O.V. LOOKING AT SUPERGIRL FROM INSIDE THE SCOOP Ethan's swirling distorted vision suddenly focuses with , absolute clarity. A moment outside of time. The most romantic glamorous image imaginable: the blonde, backlit, looking at him with concern, her lips slightly parted. BACK TO SCENE There is something about Ethan's ecstasy, which holds Supergirl for a moment. ETHAN God...you're beautiful. INT. SELENA'S LIVING ROOM Selena watches the image of Ethan and Supergirl in her mirror. Her face is a study in jealousy and dismay. ETHAN (in the mirror) God...you're beautiful.",

Selena closes her eyes and whispers to the spinning ring. SELENA Power of Shadow hear me. Find her wherever she be. Find her and destroy her. A BLACK CLOUD OF SHADOW bursts out of the centre of the OMEGAHEDRON, filling the room. Selena drops the gargoyle box and shrinks back with sudden misgivings at what she has unleashed. Even Bianca's face has gone white. The two women huddle together as a HUGE INVISIBLE PRESENCE fills the room with darkness. Then the unseen presence suddenly SMASHES ITS WAY OUTSIDE THROUGH THE SOLID WALL OF SELENA'S LIVING ROOM, leaving a big hole and a trail of crushed furniture behind it. Light returns to the room as the shadow departs. And from outside the sound of crackling shrubbery dies away. Selena regains her composure and looks around at the mess of her once splendid living room. SELENA Next time, remind me to do this out in the yard. BIANCA Yes, of course, it was foolish of me. Bianca reaches down to the floor for the gargoyle box with the OMEGAHEDRON, which is still lying right where Selena dropped it. But Selena quickly picks it up herself before Bianca can touch it.

DANVERS ' LIVING ROOM. NIGHT Mrs. Danvers is on the phone. MRS. DANVERS The housemother still doesn't answer. Mrs. Danvers hangs up the phone with a worried expression. MR. DANVERS Probably drunk again. I'm sure Linda got back all right. MRS. DANVERS We should have driven her. Mr. Danvers stands up and puts on his jacket. MR. DANVERS I'll just drop by the school and. make sure she's all right. EXT. MIDVALE SCHOOL. DESERTED CAMPUS. OUTSIDE THE DORM. NIGHT Linda drives up in Lucy's car, the one left behind at the scene of the accident outside the hamburger place. She drives past the paddle tennis court and parks in front of the dorm. Linda gets out of the car, and lets herself into the dorm with a key. Inside, she signs her name in the book. , INT. DORM CORRIDOR. NIGHT Linda walks down the long dormitory corridor past room after empty room. The place is kind of spooky. INT. LINDA'S ROOM. NIGHT Linda enters the room she shares with Lucy. She puts Lucy's car keys on her bedside table next to the snapshots of  Lucy's family and of her half-dozen current boyfriends. Linda turns and crosses the room to her own monastic bed in its drab, undecorated corner. She lies down on her bed with a sigh, staring at the ceiling in a melancholy mood. Suddenly, she senses that something is not right. She gets up from the bed, walks to the window, and gazes out a-t the deserted campus. EXT. OUTSIDE DORM. TENNIS COURT. NIGHT. The dorm is set apart from other school buildings and surrounded by tall trees. The tennis court is visible from Linda's window, and a city park adjoining the school property. The UNSEEN MONSTER is heard approaching through the park with a thud of heavy footfalls and the crack of snapping tree trunks and branches. A bolt of lightning flashes, followed by a crash of thunder. The wind howls. A storm is brewing. Far away across the campus something huge and powerful forces itself between the two big oaks, snapping them like matchsticks. The unseen monster hauls its enormous bulk toward the dormitory, crushing everything in its path, its footsteps making the ground tremble like an earthquake. INT. LINDA'S BEDROOM. NIGHT Linda watches with uncomprehending eyes the approaching swath of destruction heading straight for her. Nothing she has learned about this strange alien world has prepared\" her for this. For the first time since she left Argo City, her eyes show fear. And yet there's a deeper streak of defiance in her that impels her to stand her ground and face the horrible juggernaut. EXT. FORM. TENNIS COURT. CAMPUS. NIGHT HUGE FOOTPRINTS sink into the damp grass of the campus. A bicycle rack full of Schwinns is flattened into the dirt with a metallic screech. The monster proceeds inexorably toward the wooden rain shelter on one side of the tennis court. The shelter is crushed to kindling wood. The monster drags its enormous unseen bulk across the smooth clay surface of the tennis court, crunching , deep cracked depressions in the clay. The net stretches and groans toward Linda as the' invisible enormity comes closer, and finally snaps with a loud twanging sound as the steel cables part. The tall cyclone fence bulges outward toward Linda and momentarily outlines the form of\" the monster before it crumples and falls with the screech of twisted steel. The only thing between Linda and the monster is Lucy.' s parked car. The monster stomps the car flat with a noise like colliding express trains and heads for Linda. INT. LINDA'S BEDROOM. NIGHT LINDA Hey, that's my roommate's car! Determination floods her face. She whips off her brunette wig and her civilian clothing to reveal the blonde hair and red blue tunic of SUPERGIRL! EXT. OUTSIDE THE DORM. NIGHT Supergirl flies out the dorm window and lands in front of the unseen monster. She raises her hand in challenge and calls out in a commanding voice. SUPERGIRL Leave this place and do no harm. Something picks Supergirl up and flings her against the wall of the dorm, crushing the soft drink dispenser under her and squirting cola in every direction. Lightning flashes and thunder booms overhead. Supergirl picks herself up, shaken. She launches herself directly at the space in mid-air ten feet above the monster's footprints. She crashes into something hard and invisible with the sound of a tremendous impact. Supergirl falls to the ground, staggered by the concussion. The irresistible force has met the immovable object. Supergirl looks up, and---altering the wavelength of her X-Ray vision to a transcendental frequency---paints this beam over the monster and just for an instant makes it visible: a HUGE NIGHTMARE SHAPE LOOMING OVER HER, AND REACHING OUT TO CRUSH HER WITH MASSIVE TALONS. Then the image fades. Supergirl is seized again and flung against the school flagpole, breaking it off at the base. Supergirl stands up and seizes the flagpole. She looks up at the flickering lightning in the sky. She flies straight upward into the storm with the bare flagpole held in front of her. EXT. THUNDER STORM. LIGHTNING Again and again huge bolts of lightning strike the flagpole. Supergirl's face is contorted with agony as her body absorbs enough electricity to run Las Vegas for a year. She looks down and sees through a break in the clouds the campus far below. EXT. CAMPUS Suddenly Supergirl dives down from the sky, glowing with accumulated electricity. She embraces the monster with a tremendous crackle of energy. The two of them are bathed in brilliant arc light. The monster is briefly made visible again by the energy. But this time it is shrinking, shriveling up into a shapeless lump. The light fades as the energy is discharged. A dark, shapeless lump detaches itself from Supergirl's grasp and flies shrieking away into the night. Supergirl stands alone and exhausted, her muscles trembling with fatigue. She turns and walks unsteadily back toward the dorm. CUT TO: EXT. CAMPUS. NIGHT MR. Danvers drives up the long driveway toward Linda's dorm. He parks his car behind the flattened remains of Lucy's car, and gets out, staring with amazement at the destruction wrought by the titanic struggle. He walks toward the dorm, fear and confusion on his face. INT. DORM. ENTRY. NIGHT Mr. Danvers pushes through the unlocked front door. He glances in the sign-out book for Linda's name. Then he knocks on the door labeled HOUSEMOTHER MRS. MCCLOSKEY. No reply. He opens that door and peeks in. INT. HOUSEMOTHER'S ROOM. NIGHT A slovenly, overweight woman in a housecoat is curled up on her sofa, a bottle of whiskey clutched to her breast. She snores heroically. INT. DORM. HALLWAY.  NIGHT Mr. Danvers walks quickly down the long line of empty rooms to Linda and Lucy's room. INT. LINDA'S ROOM. NIGHT Mr. Danvers pauses at the door and looks in. Supergirl, in her blonde hair and red and blue tunic, is lying asleep on Linda's bed. MR. DANVERS A Supergirl... (to her) Linda...is it Linda? Supergirl looks up at him and smiles, weakly. SUPERGIRL I didn't want anyone to know... but I was so tired...forgot... M. Danvers sits on the side of her bed. MR. DANVERS Are you all right? SUPERGIRL Just need rest, that's all. Sorry about all the damage outside. I had to fight some terrible thing...",

SECURITY OFFICER Okay, what's going on in h-- Selena gestures with the gargoyle box at the men and their guns fly out of their hands and up to the ceiling. The men stare at the ce1ling, astonished. Ethan takes advantage of the distraction to dash out through the open door. Selena turns to look at Ethan escaping and the guns fall to the floor and discharge. The security men run into Ethan's bathroom, slamming the door behind them. Selena ducks out into the corridor. INT. HOSPITAL CORRIDOR Ethan is running away down the corridor. Frightened patients peek out of their rooms. The nurse who was ejected from the room cringes in fear as Selena emerges into the corridor. Ethan dodges past two orderlies who are pushing a HEART-LUNG MACHINE down from the surgery. Selena raises the gargoyle box and points it at the HEART-LUNG MACHINE. SELENA Power of Shadow---seize him. The HEART-LUNG MACHINE comes to life---its lights flash, its array of tubes tipped with needle probes writhe like Medusa's hair, its wheels turn around, and it chases  Ethan down the corridor. Selena laughs her deep throaty chuckle of triumph. Ethan looks behind, sees the machine chasing him and cries out with alarm. A CART OF SURGICAL INSTRUMENTS rolls out of a closet in front of him, its scalpels standing up and pointing at him, quivering eagerly, blocking his path. Ethan dives through a swinging door to his left. INT. OPERATING THEATRE A team of surgeons and nurses are bent over a patient on the table. Ethan runs through in the background. The surgeons continue with their work. The heart-lung machine wheels through after him, followed by the scalpels flying through the air like a swarm of hornets. The surgical team doesn't look up from their work. Several cylinders of anesthetic gas tear themselves loose from the wall and trundle away out of the room after Ethan and the other apparatus. One of the nurses finally looks up. NURSE Doctor, I think you' re going to have a gas problem.",

OF THE BOLTS HOLDING ETHAN'S GONDOLA TO THE FERRIS WHEEL: THE BOLTS UNSCREW AND FALL OUT. BACK TO SCENE Ethan yells as his gondola falls off the Ferris wheel and down onto the tent, which covers the DODGEM CARS. INT. DODGEM CARS TENT He falls through the tent and onto the electrified floor below. The wooden gondola shatters on impact. Ethan sits up, dazed by the fall, and sees a dodgem car painted like the face of a vicious football player heading toward him. Ethan scrambles away on his hands and knees. Another hideously painted car attacks him, and another, and another. He dodges and scuttles around desperately. Finally he manages to climb aboard one of the cars. EXT. AMUSEMENT PARK Supergirl reaches out to seize Selena. But Selena holds up the gargoyle box and is surrounded by an impenetrable, glowing shield of force. Supergirl tries to push through, the shield in vain. Supergirl flies to the little fence made out of steel spikes surrounding the Haunted House. At super speed she rips up the entire line of fence posts and hurls them like javelins at Selena. Selena dissolves her force field and tries to run away, ducking and dodging the rain of javelins. She turns too quickly and the GARGOYLE BOX slips out of her hand and rolls underneath the deck of the carousel. Selena moans with despair, and pauses, reluctant to leave without the box. This is the opportunity Supergirl needs. The fence posts bury themselves in the ground in a perfect circle around Selena---effectively imprisoning her. SUPERGIRL That ought to keep you out of my hair for a while. SELENA A cheap trick.",

The dust has the thickness of a hundred years. Moths have eaten away all the splendid tapestries. Rats cavort along the baseboards. Bats sleep in the chandeliers. In the living room Supergirl finds Bianca crouched in A Corner, gibbering mindlessly. Bianca too has changed: she is dressed in rags, and her wild staring eyes are rimmed with dark circles. When she sees Supergirl she cries with fright. SUPERGIRL Hey take it easy. I won't hurt you. BIANCA I thought .it was her, coming back. Spared me. But I thought. . . maybe changed her mind.

THE CAMERA FOLLOWS HER revealing that she has been talking to Ethan inside the mammoth fireplace of her living room. Her new house is enormous. Where before she lived in a mansion, now she dwells in a palace. The fireplace is seven feet high, the living room floor is wide as a football field, and. the French windows into the garden now tower like the windows in the North transept of Chartres Cathedral. Selena disappears out the imposing portals which lead to the wet bar and butler's pantry--each now the size of a basketball court. Back in the fireplace, Ethan cranes his neck to make sure she has gone, then reaches out toward the glass hanging nearby. He pokes the straw with his forehead. The glass swings slightly. The glass swings close enough for him to bump it with his forehead and set up a rhythm. He gauges the swing of the glass and, at the precise moment, grabs for it with his mouth. He catches hold of the rim of the glass with his teeth and holds it there for a moment as he summons his courage to do what must be done. He bites hard on the rim of the glass with his teeth. The glass shatters and falls to the floor with a crash, leaving Ethan with a small fragment of the rim in his mouth and a trickle of blood down his chin. He leans his head over until it is directly above his left hand tied to the stake two and a half feet below his shoulders. A droplet of blood falls into his hand. He drops the glass fragment down to his hand and catches it. He grins, and sighs with relief. Then spits to clear his mouth. Slowly he saws. at the ropes that hold him with the sliver of glass in his left hand. One by one the strands part. Ethan strains against his bonds and the weakened rope snaps. He quickly disentangles himself from the coils and steps out of the fireplace. He looks around the mammoth room. The coast is clear. He spits a few bits of glass out of his mouth, and dashes out of the doors to the garden. EXT. SELENA'S HOUSE. GARDEN.  CONSERVATORY Ethan sees a green plastic garden hose, which the gardener has left running in a trickle to irrigate the hydrangeas. Ethan remembers that he is very thirsty. He picks up the hose, rinses out his mouth hurriedly, and then takes long, desperate gulps of the water. Behind him he hears Selena's laughter. He drops the hose as if stung by an electric eel and turns to see her emerge from behind a large strangler fig. INSERT ETHAN'S P.O.V. The same effect as when he drank the love potion the first time. The plants of the conservatory swirl and distort in garish nightmare colours. At the centre of his vision is an area of crystal clarity surrounding Selena. She approaches him seductively, fully confident of her power. As she comes nearer, the clear area expands and drives out the visual chaos. Selena speaks, and her voice is a close-miked throaty purr. SELENA I told you I'd win. BACK TO SCENE Ethan is held by the spell of her magic. And yet there is part of him that still resists. You can see him try to turn his head away from the vision of ideal beauty before him, and then give in as she comes closer and I touches him with her hand. A zap of energy passes between them at her touch. SELENA Kiss me. He embraces her roughly and crushes her lips with a kiss. He is filled with a tigerish lust that thrills her deeply. She rakes her long red fingernails across his back and moans with pleasure. EXT. ABOVE THE MOUNTAINS. DAY Supergirl flies over the Rockies toward Selena's house. DISSOLVE TO: EXT. TALIESEN MOUNTAIN. SELENA'S NEW HOUSE. DAY Supergirl flies over Selena's new house. For the first time we can see the enormousness of it: a grotesque, towering monstrosity, that seems to brood threateningly over the landscape. EXT. GARDEN BEHIND SELENA'S NEW HOUSE. DAY Supergirl lands and walks toward the towering French doors of the living room. But something distracts her. She turns and enters the gigantic conservatory to her right. INT. CONSERVATORY Supergirl looks around and sees in the middle of the conservatory a reflecting pool surrounded by exotic plants. She walks closer and looks down into the reflecting pool. In the bottom of the shallow pool she sees Ethan securely bound. His eyes stare wildly. Dead or drowning. SUPERGIRL Ethan! She leaps into the shallow pool, and sinks over her head. A polygonal section of the surface of the reflecting pool detaches itself from the water and rises up perpendicularly. It is a door to the Phantom Zone. Supergirl is trapped behind an impenetrable force field, looking out in despair. Ethan is not there with her. His image has disappeared. The real flesh and blood Ethan appears with Selena from behind the strangler fig. They look in at Supergirl trapped behind the shimmering polygon that la ads to the Phantom Zone. Selena laughs at her, but Ethan stares as if at a long forgotten acquaintance whose name he is trying to recall. Selena notices Ethan's wandering attention and she puts her arms possessively around him. SELENA Enjoy your prison, Supergirl. It's forever. Supergirl calls out to Ethan, her hands and face pressed against the transparent wall of her prison, but no sound can escape the impenetrable force field. INT. PHANTOM ZONE DOOR Supergirl is seen in reverse, beating on the hard crystalline surface of the prison. SUPERGIRL Ethan! Don't let her do this! Beyond the threshold of the zone, Selena in her conservatory kisses Ethan with fierce lust. He returns her , emotion, forgetting all about Supergirl. SUPERGIRL No. No. It isn't true. The image of Selena and Ethan begins to recede, getting smaller and smaller, until it vanishes entirely in infinite blackness. EXT. SPACE The flat two-dimensional polygon that is Supergirl's prison whirls away through space. Behind the transparent surface we can see Supergirl's face stained with tears. EXT. PHANTOM ZONE Another kind of reality. Unlike anything we have ever seen. The crystal prison lands on the ground of the Phantom Zone and shatters. Supergirl picks herself up from among the fragments of her prison and looks around. The landscape is utterly strange and alien, with a feel of stark, oppressive sterility. As far as the eye can see there is no sign of life. Supergirl stands up and raises her arms to fly. She hops into the air about eight inches and lands flat-footedly on the sand. With a shock she realises SHE CAN'T FLY. She hops a few more times, with no more success. She picks up a small rock from the ground. She tries to crush it in her hand. She can't. Angrily she hurls it from her as far as she can. Instead of disappearing into infinity it drops at her feet a few yards away. She scoops up some sand from the ground and holds it cupped in her hand. She takes a deep breath and tries to blow it away. She is barely able to disturb a few grains. She drops the sand and sits down on a rock, forlorn and dejected. Suddenly she hears Alura's voice, very faint and coming from a long distance away. ALURA'S VOICE Kara, where are you?",

UNITED NATIONS, NEW YORK. DAY Establishing shot. INT. GENERAL ASSEMBLY The DELEGATE FROM URITANIA is going on (in Esperanto) denouncing the latest outrage against his peace-loving country. A few bored DELEGATES of various nationalities are sprawled in their seats listening to the simultaneous translation over earphones. The dign1fied PRESIDENT of the General Assembly is sitting on the dais behind the ranting delegate. With a FLASH OF LIGHT and a chok1ng cloud of sulfur fumes, Selena appears beside the podium. She is in her shimmering white robe. The dozing delegates wake up with amazement. The URITANIAN delegate stares at her with his mouth open as she slides him away from the microphone. INT.  TRANSLATOR\"S BOOTH . GENERAL ASSEMBLY Inside the translator's booth, the entire panorama of the enormous hall is visible through the glass window. The eight TRANSLATORS stop translating and stare at the scene below. BACK TO GENERAL ASSEMBLY Selena is about to speak in the microphone, when two SECURITY GQUARDS attempt to step onto the podium. Selena reaches out toward them. A field of force from her hands stops them in their tracks, knocking them backwards off the steps to land on their butts. The delegates gasp at this act of magical violence. SELENA Nations of the world! I bring you tidings of a new age! The President of the General Assembly starts to shout at her and bang on the podium with his gavel. Selena looks over her shoulder with mild annoyance. Instantly the President's gavel turns into a live eel. The President drops it with horror. Selena continues her speech. SELENA I bring you a return to the ancient true worship of Nature, our Sovereign Queen and Mother. And I bring you myself as her representative here on Earth. The URITANIAN suddenly recovers his wits and tries to place a hand on Selena's shoulder. A whirlwind hurls him off the podium into the desks of the front row delegates. The delegates babble in consternation but keep to their seats. Selena raises her voice to be heard over the uproar. SELENA From this moment forth, all science, religion and other unnatural beliefs are forbidden. And in their place I will teach the One True Way of our ancient grandmothers. The President of the General Assembly has recovered enough from the surprise of the eel to interrupt Selena.",

Selena has listened with a mocking smile as he speaks. He finishes to a smattering of applause from some of the delegates. SELENA Threats? I don't need threats to destroy civilisation. I have something better. She snaps her fingers in the air. Immediately a RAIN OF MONEY BEGINS TO FALL ALL OVER THE GENERAL ASSEMBLY. PAPER MONEY AND COINS OF ALL NATIONS. Selena looks at her work with pleasure. Then she disappears in a FLASH OF LIGHT. The delegates blink with astonishment. The only trace of her presence is the tang of sulfur in the air---and the money. One delegate forgets his dignity and starts scooping up money from his desk and stuffing it into his pockets. Suddenly all the delegates are doing the same thing. The only exception is the delegate from the United Kingdom who thinks it might be beneath his dignity, and looks about with mild disapproval. CUT TO: EXT. THE PHANTOM ZONE Supergirl walks across the rolling monotony of the Phantom Zone. We have never seen her like this before: sweating, her hair unkempt, streaks of dirt and grit on her face, exhausted and full of despair. She stumbles at the crest of a low ridge and falls down to the bottom of the slope, banging her head on a rock. She sits there, a big rip in her ,uniform, rubbing her bruised forehead. It is hard to imagine her any worse off. She hears a sound, vaguely familiar. She looks around for its source. She follows the sound, crawling slowly along the base of the ridge. The sound gets louder and as she, approaches. It is a sound of celestial, spiritual beauty: the music of the spheres. Suddenly she comes out into a tiny valley in the Phantom Zone and sees before her the most beautiful sight she could imagine. The harsh monochromatic sterility of the Phantom Zone gives way to a riot of bright colours. A dome-like building protrudes from the ground. All around it are gorgeous singing sculptures in the style of Argo City. A sculptor. in the clothing of Argo City is modeling a glassy statue with a matterwand. He turns and catches sight of Supergirl. It is Zaltar. SUPERGIRL Zaltar. Zaltar drops his wand and comes running over to Supergirl. He kneels beside her on the sandy ground. ZALTAR Kara? Is it you? Supergirl nods. She is obviously exhausted. Zaltar takes the bulb full of liquid off his belt and offers her a drink. She drinks thirstily of the refreshing green liquid, and feels strength returning to her body. SUPERGIRL What is this place?",

DAY MR. & Mrs. Danvers, Lucy Lane, and Jimmy Olsen are imprisoned in four metal cages hanging over the reflecting pool in the conservatory. The ropes that keep the cages from falling into the pool are GIGANTIC GOLDEN SERPENTS, their tails around an overhead beam, and the jaws tightly locked on the tops of the cages. A fifth cage hangs there empty. The water in the reflecting pool has changed colour to an opaque yellow. Selena shows the arrangements to Ethan. SELENA Unless Supergirl agrees to go away forever, the serpents will drop them one by one. Selena puts a small silver whistle to her lips and blows a high, melodious note. The fifth serpent opens his jaws and releases the empty cage into the pool. INSERT: REFLECTING POOL The empty cage lands in the water and is instantly eaten up by the most powerful acid imaginable, leaving nothing but froth and acrid fumes. Ethan looks down into the cool at his reflection distorted by the spreading ripples. BACK TO SCENE ETHAN Why the empty cage? SELENA That one was for you. But I thought I'd wait and see how you behave when Supergirl gets here. I'd hate to lose you, Ethan. Selena steps beside him and puts her hand on his shoulder. Ethan cries out with terror. Selena looks down at what he sees. INSERT: REFLECTING POOL Behind Selena, distorted almost beyond recognition by the ripples on the surface, is a GIANT MONSTROUS SHADOW-BEING, ITS ARMS OUTSTRETCHED, ALMOST ENVELOPING HER, but invisible except in reflections. BACK TO SCENE Selena steps away from the pool, shaken by the sight. ETHAN What...?",
