GASCONY - DAWN                                        1 Dawn. A verdant field in Gascony. BIRDS CALL from tree- tops. The WIND RUSTLES through green leaves. A fox darts into a thick hedge. And last, anti-pastoral, out of place -- the sound of CLASHING STEEL. SUPERIMPOSE:   France, 1625. Suddenly, two young men burst INTO VIEW, sword points cutting brilliant arcs through the morning air. The first is GIRARD, bearded, nearly thirty, a man in every facet. The second, D'ARTAGNAN. Younger in appearance and attitude. Exuberant, handsome. And at just this moment, bounding over a low stone wall with a boisterous cry. They battle across an expanse of turf thick with dew. Girard is the more polished combatant. But d'Artagnan is nearly a force of nature. He whips his sword through the air with wild-hearted abandon. He tumbles and somer- saults. This is fun. Girard and d'Artagnan cross the field, pass over a wooden fence, struggle toward a stable and hayloft. As they fight, both men utilize a variety of props. Handfuls of hay, a wooden spar, quick kicks from heavy boots. Anything goes as the swords cut through the air. D'Artagnan, gaining increasing advantage, forces Girard up against a peaceful country manor. Girard, seemingly cornered, executes a gymnastic flip onto the roof, fights from this high angle. D'Artagnan merely smiles... and follows. 2   ANGLE ON ROOFTOP                                           2 Seen briefly in silhouette against the rising sun, Girard and d'Artagnan scramble up the v-shaped rooftop, pause to exchange swipes at the peak, then slide down the other side, attacking, defending, as they go. 3   INCLUDE INTERIOR                                           3 Inside the manor house, a HANDSOME WOMAN of forty glances up from her writing table, hears FOOTSTEPS on the roof. She reacts -- curious, not afraid -- and steps to an open window. As  if to follow the footsteps to the other side.",

D'Artagnan flies after. The geese scatter, d'Artagnan -- whose wild progress frequently resembles that of a young colt -- stumbles briefly. Girard seeks advantage, thrusts his sword toward the young man's heart. But d'Artagnan parries the blow with a heavy gloved hand, rolls over the offending goose -- glances deadpan apology -- and rises to fight again. The epic battle continues. Girard's modest success de- volves into desperate flight. D'Artagnan's seemingly endless reserves are wearing him down. Then, at the last possible moment, Girard spies escape: a slow- moving HAYCART RUIMBLING up the country road. He runs toward the cart, leaps upon it, turns back to d'Artagnan with a confident smirk -- an expression that vanishes when the young Gascon executes a nearly impossible leap to join him. And still they battle, the clash of swords a kind of music by now, the men, their exuberance, the bright morn- ing all combined into a dazzlingly heroic display. Just then: The haycart crosses a wooden plank bridge. Girard backs from d'Artagnan's sword, weak from exhaustion, he stumbles. D'Artagnan has his man and he knows it. He prepares one last blow -- -- And the haycart shifts, deposits both men over the side and down to the small muddy creek below. A comical antidote to all this glorious swordplay. 5   INCLUDE CREEK                                              5 Girard lands flat on his back, stunned, his sword out of reach. D'Artagnan lands similarly, but recovers with grace, or rather, as much grace as the muddy situation will allow. He rolls toward Girard, sword in hand, and lightly places the sharp gleaming tip against his adam's apple. A long beat. Then a surprise. Girard begins to laugh, long and loud. D'Artagnan responds with a charmed smile.",

What he beholds is Paris as it looked in the early part of the Seven- teenth Century, its steeples and towers rising to meet the sky. For a country boy like d'Artagnan, Paris is a magical place where the wildest of dreams can come true. D'Artagnan's reverie is broken by the sound of THUNDERING HOOFBEATS coming from behind. He turns in response and what he sees is this: Two women on horseback are riding for all they're worth pursued by two men on horseback. 19   D'ARTAGNAN                                                     19 His heroic blood stirs. Women in danger! As the women GALLOP past, d'Artagnan leaps from his horse. Quickly formulating a plan, he clambers up the trunk of a nearby tree and climbs out on a branch that overhangs the road. 14. 20   ANGLE                                                       20 As the two riders pass underneath, d'Artagnan leaps into space and tackles one of them, knocking him out of the saddle. The rider hits the ground and is knocked sense- less. One down. D'Artagnan scrambles to his feet as the second rider re- verses direction and GALLOPS back, charging d'Artagnan. The rider draws his saber. D'Artagnan dodges the horse and the sword. He catches the second rider's arm and yanks him right out of the saddle. The man lands with a painful thud at d'Artagnan's feet. Before he can recover, d'Artagnan is upon him with flying fists. One swift punch -- and the second rider is senseless. Two down. D'Artagnan stands over his two victims, out of breath, but greatly pleased with his performance. He looks up as the two women ride back to see what's happened. The first woman is of noble breeding, a beautiful dark- haired girl in her late teens. Her name is ANNE. Her companion is roughly the same age, titan-haired and equally beautiful. Her name is CONSTANCE. Anne regards the two men on the ground, then d'Artagnan. She shakes her head, laughs with delight and rides off. Constance remains. She smiles down at d'Artagnan from atop her horse.",

Athos takes a Guard named Cahusac, Porthos battles BISCARAT, and Aramis battles with two adversaries at once. D'Artagnan looks for an opponent... and finds himself face to face with Jussac. The fighting style of the Musketeers is an exuberant mix- ture of styles and techniques. Athos is a brutal swords- man, his strokes overpowering and savage. His repertoire also includes swift kicks, solid punches, the occasional elbow when necessary. Aramis is a seamless and graceful technician, he handles his two opponents with balletic ease, an artist working with steel and flesh, rather than paint and canvas. And last, and perhaps the most entertaining of all, Porthos. He is a walking arsenal, carrying a variety of bizarre weapons on his body -- a crossbow, daggers, bolo, nunchucks -- all of which he uses with the polished skill of a master. Add this funhouse of armaments to his already impressive size and strength, and you have a one- man wrecking crew of epic proportions. D'Artagnan's youthful energy is by now familiar. He bounds about like a newborn tiger, encircles his adver- sary, changing stance and shifting his ground with alac- rity. Jussac is having a hard time defending himself against his opponent who seems to be attacking from all directions at once.",

On the jagged cliff above, a black mass of trees is outlined against a stormy sky filled with copper-colored clouds, surreal in effect. A sinister procession approaches the cliff. Porthos leads Milady. She wears a simple white shift, her hair pulled back into a long braid. She looks years younger, the girl she used to be. The Executioner walks behind them. Followed by Armand de Winter, Aramis, d'Artagnan. And Athos. He watches every step. The procession stops at the cliff's edge. THUNDER RUMBLES. Lightning slashes the sky. The Executioner ties Milady's hands behind her. The Executioner removes a bright scimitar from beneath his cloak. Milady catches Athos' eye. He holds her gaze.

Long blonde curly hair that cascades in ringlets to her shoulders, languid blue eyes, and skin as white as alabaster. She is known as MILADY DE WINTER. She is to sex, what Constance is to innocence. D'Artagnan watches as if in a dream. The carriage, the beautiful woman inside it. Paris wraps its arms around the young man's heart. Suddenly: a second face enters the carriage window, replacing hers, jarring by contrast. It is the fierce visage of Milady's Indo-Chinese Bodyguard, PARKER. The bodyguard glares, pulls at the carriage window curtains, taking Milady, the dream, from view. HOLD ON d'Artagnan, bewitched, as the CARRIAGE RUMBLES off into the city.",
