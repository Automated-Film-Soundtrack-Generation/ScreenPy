We see that the figures are a young, dark-haired, beautiful woman, with her hair tied back under a hard hat, and an older man, who is using a tool on a section of the laser, and is also wearing a hard hat. The woman is LORA and the man is DR. WALTER GIBBS. He's wearing a copper bracelet above his digital watch/calculator, and has an intense, almost insane look to his dark eyes, with their bristling white eyebrows.

It's horrible. Beneath the floating cylinder face two inverted cones of light, meeting at their apex, support it. We continue moving forward, the MCP looming over us.

He studies his hands -- and SEES that they're now nonluminescent flesh and blood. He looks out the window and SEES that it's shortly past dawn, with weak sunlight coming in. And, at the SOUND of light MACHINERY at work, he turns to look at Lora's computer terminal, where a hard-copy computer PRINTER is coughing out a long document on wide blue paper. Flynn gets up off the floor, goes over to the printer, and READS the document. As he does so, his eyes widen, and a SMILE appears on his face. The printer finishes its run, clicks patiently. Flynn, exuberant, tears the printout from the machine and rushes to the door with it.",
