As he passes behind Harry he reaches into his coat-- Harry spins lightning fast.  He knocks away the SILENCED PISTOL aimed at the back of his head with a sweeping block, capturing Yusif's arm in an arm-lock.  The shot goes wide, shattering a urinal. Harry slams his palm into Yusif's face like a piledriver, and spins him against the steel stalls.  The silenced pistol goes skittering across the floor. Mahmoud whips a pistol out of his waistband.  Still holding the bear-like Yusif, Harry draws his Glock so fast we can barely see him move.  BLAM!  BLAM!  BLAM!  Three .45 slugs  go through Mahmoud's chest, shattering the mirror behind him.  He flops on his butt, slumping against the wall. Yusif, who is easily Harry's size, bellows and grabs his gun arm.  They smash against the walls, struggling for the gun. Yusif, locked to Harry, hurls him against the stalls.  They hit a locked door, which pops open, banging inward. Yusif drives Harry to the floor.  Harry's head is between the shoes of an OLD GUY sitting on the can, who looks down uncomprehendingly at him. Yusif slams Harry's gun hand repeatedly against the doorframe of the stall.  He twists Harry's wrist brutally.  He even pounds against Harry's hand with his knee.  The old guy winces. That's got to hurt.  Harry cries out in pain and the gun drops. Yusif reaches for it, but Harry kicks it under the stalls. He punches Yusif in the face, driving him back.  They grapple, spinning.  Harry drives Yusif's head into the counter.  Then he elbows him in the throat and they crash together on the filthy floor.  Harry grabs Yusif's hair and pounds his face repeatedly against the rim of a urinal.  In case you haven't noticed, this is a messy, nasty fight.  Survival is like that. Yusif sags into submission.  Harry pulls a nylon zip-strip out of his pocket and uses it like hand-cuffs, securing Yusif's wrists. 83   EXT. MALL - NIGHT Gib is running full out, drawing his gun.  He has one finger jammed in his ear.  His gut is doing the rumba as he runs.",

She is hyperventilating, terrified, but thinking clearly. Malik steps up on the crane, crawling out after her.  He knows she will not drop the key as long as he has the gun.  It is a game which will end when she reaches the end of the boom.  Dana puts the key between her teeth so she can hang on better.  It is windy and the boom is swinging. 306   INT. 20TH FLOOR - DAY The Crimson Jihad warriors hear a thunderous, shrieking roar and look toward the window. 307   EXT.

He must have that key. 310   EXT. ROOF - NEAR HELICOPTER - DAY Malik's TWO REMAINING MEN run to the helicopter, gesticulating to the pilot to get ready to take off.  The pilot revs the turbine and the rotor whirls faster.  The two men jump in, picking up M-60 machine guns. 311   EXT. ROOF - CRANE BOOM - DAY MALIK IS STILL ADVANCING out the crane boom.  Dana slips as she backs up, toppling off the boom.  She is hanging now by her hands over a 20 story drop. Malik is almost to her.  He needs a hand free to grab her.  He sets his gun down on the girder.  He grabs for her wrist. 312   EXT. ROOF - OVERLOOKING EDGE - DAY ANGLE LOOKING DOWN.  Malik, Dana, the street far below.

It tilts and plummets, auto-rotating out of control. 320   EXT. BUILDING - ANGLE AT STREETLEVEL - DAY As the copter hits the ground and explodes.  Fortunately the police had created a cleared perimeter. 321   EXT. HARRIER - DAY THE HARRIER dips and slews, half out of control.  Malik is taking aim with the pistol, right at Harry's head.  Harry grabs his daughter with his left hand, holding her with all his strength and he-- Jinks the stick hard, just as-- Malik opens fire, but-- The plane tilts wildly and Malik topples, screaming-- He slides along the wing, and falls over the leading edge-- Only to catch himself on the only available hand-hold-- The last Sidewinder missile. 322   EXT.
