Two balls and two, and so on. Slight difference.  There are no strings supporting the balls, thus defying gravity.

She notices what appears to be an unusually complex network of bones in the forearm.  Jean looks down and runs her fingers over the traces of three incisions on the backs of Loganis hands.  Jeanis eye moves across his body.  His rippling muscles. Jean uncaps an IV needle and moves to the middle of Loganis arm.  We cannot help but notice a diamond ring on her left hand. Jean starts to put an IV in Loganis arm. Just as she is sticking the needle in his arm HE JOLTS VIOLENTLY. SNAP Loganis hand reaches up quickly, breaking the needle off in his arm.  He grabs a startled Jean by the throat. He is out of bed.  She is unable to speak, choked silent by his grip. He places his fist near her face.  We see the three faint scars just above his knuckles.

And hanging from the other side in a row, are UNIFORMS, much like the ones Cyclops and Storm were wearing in the snow.

He spots another entrance on the far side of the room and, carrying his clothes, he staggers out, still in considerable pain. INT. HANGER - DAY Logan rushes through the door, looking behind to see if he has been seen.  He closes the door and leans back to catch his breath... which stops momentarily as he looks around the massive hanger he has entered. The X-Jet, the stealth plane we saw in Alaska, now sits parked and quiet. Logan walks to the plane and stops -- listening.  We hear a strange THUMPING.  He listens for a second.  The sound picks up in speed and we realize that we are listening to the SOUNDS OF A BASKETBALL GAME coming from above. As Logan tries to digest this, the door that he had just come through begins to open, letting in a shaft of light. Logan looks around wildly for a moment, looking for a place to hide when - BING.

He is stretching not only his limbs, but his unusual appendages in the morning breeze. Sensing something - the boy turns, and sees this shambling ruin of a man in the doorway. Off Loganis expression, we hear the flapping of wings and see his awestruck face following the boy onto the sky. This only holds his attention for a moment.  Logan looks across an expanse of grounds that house the Mansion.  A high, wrought-iron gate surrounds the entire property. He watches as several children play basketball across a large court. Logan shakes his head and is out the closing door. Xavier simply watches from his window. EXT. MANSION - FRONT GATE - DAY Logan heads for the gate. SHOOK -- Logan pops his claws. Suddenly, the gate slowly opens -- Inviting him to leave. He pauses, momentarily confused.  He takes one long look back at the mansion.  And then leaves. Stay for a moment.  Watch him go.

He looks at his own skin - no apparent change.  He shakes his head, blinks his eyes. Sabretooth and Pyro are also a bit struck by the display and they also seem a bit dazed. Magneto walks over and reaches into the still steaming metal device.  His hand comes out holding the dog tag - actually its remains. A frazzled, blackened wire, warped and spent.  Nothing more.  And this turns to dust in his fingers. Magneto has amazed even himself this time. The silence is shattered by a phone ringing.  Sabretooth picks it up.  He listens, then hands the phone to Magneto.",

The waifish young thing who hides so well in the shadows seems more comfortable to be moving through the mansion at night. She passes through the halls and rooms not making a sound in her strangely-swathed body suit. INT. LOGANiS ROOM - NIGHT She creaks a door open slowly, letting a shaft of dim light slice the darkness. The light shines across a nightstand.  Rogue stares down at the notepad, a sketch it.  It is of an animal, small but fierce - a wolverine. She walks in to a figure laying in the bed and stands over him.  Over Logan. He lays under a single sheet, sweating, his eyes moving quickly this way and that in R.E.M.  His hands twitch. Rogue leans closer. PUSH IN ON LOGANiS EYES AS THEY MOVE UNDER THE LIDS. FLASH - DREAM SEQUENCE INT. MILITARY LAB - THE PAST - NIGHT Like none we have ever seen thus far.  In fact, judging by most of the instruments here, we are looking at a laboratory some fifty years old. Logan looks down and we can see his body, naked, strapped to a table. A hand puts a mask over his mouth and - BLACK He awakens - STILL LOGANiS P.O.V. He struggles weakly with restraints as doctors in lab coats and thick, red rubber gloves stand over him taking notes, paying very little attention to him at all. On the other side of the room is a huge vat filled with some kind of molten metal. At the base of the vat is a giant electromagnet generating a huge gyroscope which created enormous friction energy - the apparent source of the intense heat for melting the metal in the vat. AGAIN THE MASK PUTS HIM UNDER AND: BLACK Awake again, but this time sinking into water - restrained completely now. Logan looks down and gets only a glance of his body, seeing that he is a series of incisions from head to toe - literally split open - the flesh held back with hundreds of clamps. HE SINKS INTO THE STRANGE LIQUID - LIKE WATER BUT THICK AND VISCOUS. And the sound of a DROWNING SCREAM. AND THE METAL IS POURED IN AFTER HIM. THE SOUND OF MOLTEN METAL HITTING LIQUID IS UNNERVING. Mixed with screams, it is unbearable. INT. LOGANiS ROOM - NIGHT SCREAMING Loganis screaming as he comes to. Loganis eyes FLASH OPEN.  He looks up and sees a figure looming over him.  In a flash he reacts. THUD.  Nothing more.  Then silence. The door bursts open and Cyclops stands in the doorway shocked.  Frozen.  Jean is next and finally Storm.  They can only stare. Logan sits upright in bed, CLAWS EXTENDED, INTO ROGUEiS CHEST.  She is literally frozen at the end of his arm. Finally, Cyclops breaks the silence and moves to grab her.",

Rogue staggers, she pitches forward and touches his face gently with her hands, as though she would like him to be the last thing she sees on this Earth. Logan and Rogue, locked in a fatal moment of tenderness snaring a look of loneliness that only they can understand. But suddenly, Logan seems to change. And before he can say another word, he begins to tremble, then he starts to howl in pain. Rogue SNAPS BACK, mouth open in a gaping, silent scream. What sound comes out does not match the expression at all.  Merely a gasp, like steam escaping.  Through the huge slash in her clothes, we see the wound on her chest slowly vanish. Before long, she transforms back into a healthy young girl with no sign of injury. Then, her escaping breath begins to accelerate, much in the way Loganis did - too much like Loganis did.  It is as if she has taken in his trait of berserker rage.  Soon she is smashing things all around her.  One hand rakes the wallpaper like claws. Finally, she gets a hold of herself, becoming the introverted Rogue we all know so well. Then she stands slowly, looks at the others. And she runs from the room.  Storm runs after her. The rest turn to Logan, who lays on the floor, convulsing. Jean goes to help him.  She looks back at Cyclops.  His expression makes it clear that his worst fears about Logan have come to pass. EXT. PUBLIC BEACH - DAY A familiar scene of suburban escapism.  Crowded enough that most people can move about unnoticed. In fact, most people do not notice the very large jellyfish shooting through the water at remarkable speed. And only a few notice the COMPLETELY TRANSPARENT MAN emerging from the water. It is Senator Kelly, and he resembles in many ways a jellyfish.  His skin and innards are clear and gooey.  It is only when he comes completely and naked out of the water that he returns to somewhat normal. He walks up to the beach and people recoil from the very sight of him.  Pointing, whispering.  Then just laughing at the naked man. Kelly grabs a towel off an empty chair, a Hawaiian shirt off another. Suddenly, he buckles, grabbing his stomach and lurching away in terrible pain. He barely pauses when he hears a childis voice in semi- whisper: CHILDiS VOICE Mom, is that a mutant? INT. HALLWAY - DUSK Storm and Logan walk down the hall.  Logan is wearing sweats.  He has obviously just woken up.  The sun is low in the horizon and the hall is suffused with an orange glow. Students pass by them.  By now, the students have heard rumors about what happened the night before.  They watch Logan fearfully as they pass by him.",
