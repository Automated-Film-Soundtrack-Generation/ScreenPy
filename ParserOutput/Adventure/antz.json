As if on a spring release, the termite's jaws clamp shut -- and shatter the base of the column.  The walls of the room begin to rumble... The termite turns to eat Z...but is crushed by a stone falling from the ceiling, which gives a final shudder and collapses , raining earth and stones down on the queen.
