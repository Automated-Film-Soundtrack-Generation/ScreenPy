This is COLOSSUS. From a very LOW ANGLE, we look up to see just how massive he is. He seems to fill the Heavens. With his shaved head and giant club, he seems more ogre than man. In the bandstands, a YOUNG BOY's jaw drops in awe. Colossus walks down the row, letting the crowd get a better look at him. Some reach out to touch him, disbelieving. A tight spotlight follows him, revealing faces in the crowd. Colossus passes Edward, who seems unimpressed. He leans with the spotlight, WHISTLING to get the big man's attention. He points to the edge of the stands, where his friend is sitting on the dirt -- KARL THE GIANT stands up, so big the spotlight has to widen just to hold him. He's a good foot taller than Colossus.
