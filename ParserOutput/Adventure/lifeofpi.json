Pi, terrified, grabs an oar and holds it out, trying to prevent an attack. Unfortunately, he also blocks Richard Parker's path back under the tarp. The tiger tries to go around the oar, and when Pi blocks his way, the tiger swings a paw, knocking the oar into the ocean with such force that Pi is spun completely around with his back to the tiger. He falls into a crouch, cowering, prepared to die. Richard Parker's predator instinct takes over. He snarls and pounces on the tarp, menacingly close to Pi - then hesitates, unsettled by the softness of the tarp beneath his feet. The tiger retreats, examining his surroundings. Pi jumps toward the raft. He belly flops into the ocean and rises in a panic, trying to scramble up onto the raft, only to have it flip completely over his head.

A shark slips up alongside Pi and bumps him, sending Pi scrambling back to the safety of the raft. 91    EXT. THE LIFEBOAT - DAY                                     91 Pi pulls the raft to the back of the lifeboat, tying the rope line on one of the tarp hooks. Hands appear on the gunnels. Pi lifts his head over the bow. The tiger is nowhere in sight. Pi quietly climbs aboard. He tries in vain to control his chattering teeth and shaking limbs as he opens the starboard bow storage bench. He sees a duffel bag, zips it open and rifles through the contents. It contains an array of survival supplies - as he lifts it out, his eye falls upon a stack of cans marked \"Water.\" He pops a hole in a water can with the can opener and drinks one, tilting his head back and closing his eyes in ecstasy. He throws a few on the raft. He grabs a couple of boxes marked \"Baked Wheat Biscuits.\" Pi tears open a box and stuffs a biscuit into his mouth. 42. The biscuits are so dry that he is barely able to chew them - crumbs fall from his lips into the supply hatch. A rat skitters out from under the tarp, grabbing biscuit crumbs, then retreating. A low growl. Richard Parker charges out from his den and bounds onto the tarp. Pi staggers in terror and falls helplessly into the storage bench, with only his head poking out above the tarp. The tiger steps toward Pi, then hesitates - again, the softness of the tarp unnerves him. He steps back off the tarp and paces the stern. Pi creeps out of the storage bench - then watches in horror as Richard Parker swivels and charges him again, this time beneath the tarp. The rat scurries back out of hiding and Richard Parker's head follows, looming up out from the gap between the tarp and the storage bench. Pi jumps onto the tarp, out of the tiger's reach. Richard Parker scrambles backward and reappears at the far end of the tarp, roaring, prepared to attack from above - then halts, watching in astonishment as the rat hops around the lifeboat, finally running up Pi's shirt and landing on Pi's head. Pi grabs the rat by the tail and throws it. The rat sails, paws and tail stretched wide, across the boat. Richard Parker opens his mouth and the rat flies in, its tail disappearing between the tiger's lips like a spaghetti noodle. As Richard Parker enjoys his treat, Pi climbs backward over the bow, unhooking the rope, grabbing the water cans and the biscuits and slipping over the side, falling into the water. He drops onto the raft and pushes himself back with his feet. The raft floats back and hits the end of the ropeline with a jerk. Pi remembers the rope and goes back to untie it. Suddenly Richard Parker appears at the bow and lunges at him, almost falling off the front of the lifeboat onto Pi. The tiger scrambles back onto the boat and off the tarp, while Pi paddles the raft away. When he is finally at a safe distance, fear and stress overwhelm Pi - he throws up what little food and water he has taken. 43. 92   EXT.

He tosses it as far as possible; the can splashes down, rippling the water, then bobs, going nowhere. Pi stares at the bobbing can, crushed as he sees the futility of this plan. A defeated pause, and then Pi looks up and sees the majesty of his surroundings. The cloud cover breaks; dawn light glows down on Pi. A grunt from the lifeboat. Pi turns, surprised. He grabs the tow line and reels into the lifeboat. He lifts the tarp; Richard Parker's eyes glow out at him from the shadows, greeting Pi with a low snarl.

He hauls in the netting and wrestles the dorado onto the raft, flailing against the creature's strength and throwing his full weight onto the creature to keep it from sliding back into the ocean, riding it like a bucking bronco. Pi grabs a hatchet from the raft and strikes the fish over and over again.

He moves around to the side of the boat, grabs the dorado by the tail and throws the entire fish over the side and into the stern. It lands with a thud, and from somewhere inside the boat, Richard Parker lets out a grunt of surprise. After a moment, Pi hears the wet mashing noises of the tiger devouring the fish. As Pi pushes away from the lifeboat, he puts the whistle in his mouth, blowing a few sharp blasts to remind Richard Parker who's in charge. 112A   EXT.

All around the raft, the green surface of the water glows with millions of flecks of glowing plankton - and beneath the surface, fish swim past at multiple depths and in multiple directions. Pi brushes his fingers over the surface of the water. The surface ripples where he touched it, the plankton glowing more brightly, the effect moving outward and downward through the water, an ever-expanding ring. Pi hears a faint, rapid succession of blows. He peers into the encroaching darkness but can see nothing. Richard Parker is nowhere to be seen. The blows stop and Pi returns his attention to the light show below. Pi senses movement deep within the water, a cone of rushing energy pressing up toward the luminescent surface. Suddenly, the glowing silhouette of a huge creature wrapped in phosphorescent plankton - a HUMPBACK WHALE - streaks to the surface nearby, its mouth gaping. Fifty feet in length, it thrusts itself up into the air. Pi barely has time to react, gripping the raft and holding on for his life as the whale comes crashing back down into the water.",

He lays the boat hook on the tarp and climbs aboard, crawling forward to free the gaff. As he wiggles the hook free, Richard Parker's head pops out from beneath the tarp only a few feet away.

Some sail clear over the boat; a number crash into the side.   Other, less fortunate fish land in the boat, where they start   a racket of flapping and flailing. Pi yelps in anguish   as he is struck repeatedly. The school of fish is being pursued through the ocean by tuna. It is a feeding frenzy - the ocean boils with jumping fish and snapping jaws. Richard Parker becomes totally absorbed in the kill, leaping, blocking, and batting down as many of the fish as he can. A fat, three-foot long yellowfin tuna lands onboard, cracking hard against the center bench and falling, stunned and twitching, into the boat. Pi sees Richard Parker's head swivel in his direction. In a moment of insanity brought on by hunger, Pi reaches back and grabs the boat hook from the tarp, shoving it aggressively into the tiger's face just as Richard Parker launches forward. The boat hook catches Richard Parker square in the mouth; the tiger staggers back in shock and growls in outrage. Pi rises up to his full height, staring directly into the tiger's eyes and shouting in fury, his gaze wide, his posture defiant.",

'Stop whining and be happy,' he said. \"We need more food or we'll die. That was the whole point.' 'What was the point?' Mother asked. \"You let that poor boy die in order to get bait? You monster!' The cook got furious. He started towards her with his fists raised, and Mother slapped him hard, right across the face. I was stunned. I thought he was going to kill her right then. But he didn't. The cook didn't stop at bait either, no. The sailor, he went the same way the rat went - the cook was a resourceful man. It was a week later that he... Because of me. Because I couldn't hold onto a stupid turtle. It slipped out of my hands and swam away and the cook came up and punched me on the side of the head and my teeth clacked and I saw stars. I thought he was going to hit me again, but then Mother started pounding on him with her fists and screaming, \"MONSTER! MONSTER!\" She yelled at me to go to the raft - \"Nee poda!\" I thought she was coming with me or I'd never have... I don't know why I didn't make her go first. I think about that every day. I jumped over and turned back just as the knife came out. There wasn't anything I could do; I couldn't look away... He threw her body overboard. Then the sharks came. I saw what they... I saw. The next day I killed him. He didn't even fight back. He knew he had gone too far, even by his standards. He'd left the knife out on the bench. And I did to him what he did to the sailor. He was such an evil man, but worse still, he brought the evil out in me. (MORE)",
