We PUSH IN UNDER the railway arch until we can make out a splash of white in the shadows -- the Doctor from the hospital is slumped down against the wall. We PUSH IN ALL THE WAY, so that we CAN SEE that the Doctor is actually Holmes. There is something grotesque about his face, he hasn't completely removed his disguise. Parts of it hang down, obscuring him -- -- but not obscuring the light of instability in his eyes. They begin to overflow with tears. He brushes them away then looks at his wet hand, horrified. 94B-94E OMITTED                                                 94B-94E 95     INT. PUNCH BOWL PUB - ATTIC                                   95 Holmes enters, disturbed, pained.   Emotions swirling. He pulls out a newspaper with the story of Standish's death, the pages and strange sacrificial offerings (bone, hair, feather, fang) from Sir Thomas' house. Gathering himself, Holmes stands in the middle of the bare room and starts to lay out the clues he has on the floor. The Ox bone directly in front of him (at 12 o'clock). The eagle feather to his right (at 3 o'clock). The human hair behind him (at 6 o'clock) and the Lion's fang to his left (at 9 o'clock). Then with a piece of charcoal Holmes draws a circle around each image and a circle directly in the center of the four other circles. He then draws lines which join the circles together in the shape of a cross. In the center circle he draws a pentagram (using wax from a burning candle?). Then he pours a ring of salt around that circle. He lights four candles (one at each point of the cross) then stands in the center of the circle. He pulls a pocket knife from his coat, opens the blade, cuts his thumb and allows the drops of blood to drip onto the ground just outside the circle.
