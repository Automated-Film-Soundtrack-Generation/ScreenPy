GALAXY - PLANET HOTH A Star Destroyer moves through space, releasing Imperial probe robots from its underside. One of these probes zooms toward the planet Hoth and lands on its ice- covered surface.  An explosion marks the point of impact. EXT. HOTH - METEORITE CRATER - SNOW PLAIN - DAY A weird mechanical sound rises above the whining of the wind.  A strange probe robot, with several extended sensors, emerges from the smoke-shrouded crater.  The ominous mechanical probe floats across the snow plain and disappears into the distance. EXT. PLAIN OF HOTH - DAY A small figure gallops across the windswept ice slope.  The bundled rider is mounted on a large gray snow lizard, a Tauntaun.  Curving plumes of snow rise from beneath the speeding paws of the two-legged beast. The rider gallops up a slope and reins his lizard to a stop.  Pulling off his protective goggles, Luke Skywalker notices something in the sky.  He takes a pair of electrobinoculars from his utility belt and through them sees smoke rising from where the probe robot has crashed. The wind whips at Luke's fur-lined cap and he activates a comlink transmitter.  His Tauntaun shifts and moans nervously beneath him.",

Luke hangs upside down, ankles frozen into icy stalactites, his extended arms within a foot of the snow floor.  One side of his face is covered in a dried mask of frozen blood.  He opens his eyes as a chilling moan of the hideous ice creature echoes off the gorge walls.  Luke pulls himself up, grabs hold of his ankles, and futilely tries to unfasten the throngs. Exhausted, he drops back into his hanging position.  As he hangs there, he spies his lightsaber lying near a pile of his discarded gear, about three feet out of reach. He focuses on the saber and, as his hand strains toward the weapon, he squeezes his eyes tight in concentration. Just as the ice creature looms over Luke, the lightsaber jumps into Luke's hand. The young warrior instantly ignites his sword, swinging up, and cuts himself loose from the ice.  He flops to the snow in a heap.  The startled creature moves back, his giant yellow eyes blinking.  Luke scrambles to his feet.  He swings his lightsaber and the beast screams in pain. EXT. HOTH - ENTRANCE TO ICE GORGE - DUSK Luke staggers out of the gorge into the dark and snowy twilight.  Weak and exhausted, he stumbles down a snow bank. EXT. HOTH - SNOW PLAIN - DUSK A small, lone figure riding a Tauntaun races through the hostile vastness of snow and cold.

Running beneath the monstrous machine, Luke fires his harpoon gun at the walker's underside.  A thin cable follows the projectile from the gun.  The magnetic head and cable attach firmly to the metal hull. Still running under the walker, Luke attaches the cable drum to his belt buckle.  Soon he is pulled up the cable and hangs dangling underneath the walker. The walker's giant feet continue to pound onward across the frozen snow.  Stray laser bolts whistle by Luke as he climbs up the cable to the walker's hull, reaching a small hatch.  Hanging precariously, Luke cuts the solid metal hatch with his laser sword. He takes a landmine from around his neck and throws it inside the Imperial machine.  Quickly, Luke starts down the cable and crashes onto the icy ground far below.  He lies unconscious as a giant rear leg passes by - and just misses him. The giant walker stops in mid-step.

The small, gnomish structure radiates a warm glow from its thick glass windows.  As rain tap-dances a merry tune on Artoo's head, the stubby little droid rises up on his tip-toes to peek into one of the glowing portals. INT. CREATURE'S HOUSE Artoo, peeking in the window, sees the inside of the house - a very plain, but cozy dwelling.  Everything is in the same small scale as the creature.  The only thing out of place in the miniature room is Luke, whose height makes the four-foot ceiling seem even lower.  He sits cross-legged on the floor of the living room. The creature is in an adjoining area - his little kitchen - cooking up an incredible meal.  The stove is a steaming hodgepodge of pots and pans.  The wizened little host scurries about chopping this, shredding that, and showering everything with exotic herbs and spices.  He rushes back and forth putting platters on the table in front of Luke, who watches the creature impatiently.",

Luke draws a deep breath, then pushes deeper into the cave. The space widens around him, but he feels that rather than sees it. His sword casts the only light as he peers into the darkness.  It is very quiet here. Then, a loud HISS! Darth Vader appears across the blackness, illuminated by his own just-ignited laser sword.  Immediately, he charges Luke, saber held high.  He is upon the youth in seconds, but Luke sidesteps perfectly and slashes at Vader with his sword. Vader is decapitated.  His helmet-encased head flies from his shoulders as his body disappears into the darkness.  The metallic banging of the helmet fills the cave as Vader's head spins and bounces, smashes on the floor, and finally stops. For an instant it rests on the floor, then it cracks vertically.  The black helmet and breath mask fall away to reveal... Luke's head. Across the space, the standing Luke gasps at the sight, wide-eyed in terror. The decapitated head fades away, as in a vision. EXT.
