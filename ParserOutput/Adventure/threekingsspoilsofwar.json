The Iraqis see the grenade land, they scramble for it.  One of them grabs it up and is about to throw it back out of the gunship. Too late.

Full of poison: WES(CONT) You die! Wes is just about to squeeze back the trigger when a shot rings out.  Wes' body jerks like he's just been hit in the back with a truck.

He yells for the shack: EPPS Hellooooo-- Before Epps can even finish getting the word out machine gun fire erupts from the house and burns towards Epps and Jaeger. They dive for cover, hugging the ground as bullets whistle and ping through the space around them.  They are forced back and down against a narrow stretch of rock, but it offers little protection and is chipped away by the hot lead.  It's just a matter of moments before nothing stands before them and death.  At the top of his lungs Jaeger starts yelling: JAEGER Ashra Ka mahari dahra sahib!  Ashra Ka mahari dahra sahib! Just as quickly as it began the shooting stops.  From the shack we hear some chatter in Arabic, then the door opens.  A few MEN appear in the doorway.  They laugh and beckon for Epps and Jaeger to join them. EPPS What did you say? JAEGER I don't know.  Something Wes had taught me.  I think it means \"Don't shoot. We're your friends.\" EPPS They must be Saudis.  It's a Saudi checkpoint.  Oh sweet, Jesus.  Come on. Come on! Epps hurriedly stumbles in the dark for the shack.  Jaeger is just steps behind him. They enter the dimly lit shack to the good nature of the FOUR men inside.  Epps and Jaeger see a fire in an open hearth and go right to it to warm their bands as the four men go on chattering behind them. JAGER Oh, man, this is good.  What do you think the chances are they've got a whirlpool in this place? As they rub their hands together Epps looks up.  He freezes. Hanging on the wall is a very handsome, nicely framed portrait of Saddam Hussein.  Epps nudges Jaeger who also looks up.  He also freezes. JAEGER(CONT) Oh, God...

EPPS Well, you're going to start with a bang, 'cause you've got four of them to take down. Behind Epps and Jaeger one of the Iraqis asks a question of them in Arabic. JAEGER Can't you-- EPPS I don't have a weapon. Again the Iraqi asks the question.  We can tell by the tone of his voice he expects an answer. EPPS(CONT) Don't go bitch on me now!  You were going to kill me.  Kill them! JAEGER I just said I would.  I don't think I-- EPPS Shoot them! The Iraqis sense that something is wrong.  They move menacingly for their weapons. EPPS(CONT) Shoot them, Jaeger!  SHOOT THEM! Jaeger whips around at the same time pulling his M-16.  He jerks back hard on the trigger spraying back and forth, back and forth. Dig it:  The Iraqis do a death dance in the strobe light of the muzzle flashes.  They do the twist, they do the jerk, then they all fall down. The bullets that miss do a nasty job of redecorating the place; shredding walls, eating up wood. Jaeger keeps firing until his clip is empty.  He stands huffing, eyes glazed like he's a million miles away from what he just did.  Epps steps up and takes the weapon from Jaeger. That's like an alarm clock that brings Jaeger back to the land of the living.  Jaeger takes one look around at all the carnage, then doubles over and gets to puking. Epps just watches this pathetic sight.  When Jaeger is all done: EPPS(CONT) Let's get some sleep. FADE TO: BLACK FADE TO: INT. SHACK - MORNING The sun has just pushed itself well above the horizon as Jaeger comes awake.  The second he does he sees a MAN - Arab, wearing white robes - peering through the window.  Jaeger gives a start, and the man disappears.  Jaeger quickly shakes Epps awake. JAEGER Epp...Epps!  There's someone at the window! This wakes Epps up quick. EPPS An Iraqi? JAEGER I don't know.  He didn't have a uniform on.  He...he had on white robes, like the guys who killed Wes. Epps does some quick figuring, then staying low, scrambles across the floor to one of the dead Iraqis and grabs up his weapon.  He grabs another one tosses it to Jaeger. Carefully, still low, Epps creeps over to the window.  Slowly he raises up and looks out. JAGER(CONT) See anything? EPPS Nothing. Epps lowers himself back down and does some thinking. JAEGER What do we do? EPPS We can't stay here.  Even if that wasn't an Iraqi soldier it's only a matter of time before some show up.  Get all the water you can carry, and we'll head out on foot. JAEGER To where? EPPS Sun rises in the East.  We go the opposite direction.  May not find anything, but at least we'll know we're heading towards Saudi Arabia. As Jaeger gathers up what water he can find, creeps for the door.  With the muzzle of his gun he pulls it open a crack and peers out.  Still nothing.  It's like the man vanished into thin air. Jaeger, stocked up on water, comes over with the gold and Epps' pack which Epps shoulders.",

He doesn't say anything, he makes no threatening moves.  The three stay still as statues for several beats until Epps jerks his head indicating to Jaeger they should move on.

Like something out of an old John Ford western dozens of mounted Arabs suddenly appear over a dune.  They ride fast and hard for Epps and Jaeger like Apaches heading for a wagon train.  They easily overtake our two, momentarily swallowing them amongst the thundering hoofs, and ride on a bit as if playing with them. Epps and Jaeger stop, then bolt in the other direction.  The Arabs ride back, again past Epps and Jaeger swiping them to the ground; the horses kicking up a spray of lose sand over them.  It looks like a cattle round up, and our two are the cattle. Epps and Jaeger get up to make another run of it, and again the Arabs bear down on them.  This time they mean business. They completely surround them, cutting off all means of escape.  The Arabs start screaming something back and forth in Arabic.  We don't know what, but it sounds unpleasant. Epps and Jaeger come skidding to a halt.  They turn in their tracks digging in the scene.  It goes like this:  They are completely outnumbered and out gunned by a mounted force. Doesn't get any simpler. Epps and Jaeger drop their weapons.  Their hands go in the air. CUT TO: EXT. SHI'ITE CAMP - LATER The mounted Arabs lead Epps and Jaeger, hands tied before them and almost literally being towed by the horses, into their camp.  It is similar to the Shi'ite camps we've seen before with several tent dwellings. As the party enters groups of Shi'ites come over to stare at Epps and Jaeger.  They chatter amongst themselves, but our boys have no idea what they're talking about, and that just makes things all the scarier. From our boy's point of view this is all like an unending nightmare:  Being dragged along through a desert, not knowing the language, not knowing what's going to happen.  Their world skews and slides as if they were on a tilt-a-whirl. Finally they reach a tent.  One of the Arabs tosses Epps and Jaeger's packs on the ground just before it.  Another cuts them loose and SHOVES THEM INSIDE THE TENT, then yells something at them in Arabic.  He leaves, and our two are alone. JAEGER What do you make of them? EPPS Shi'ites, I think. JAEGER Is that good, or bad? EPPS I don't know.  They killed Wes. JAEGER Why haven't they killed us!? EPPS I don't know! JAEGER ...Maybe...maybe we can fight our way out. EPPS With what?  Against how many? JAEGER We can't just sit here waiting to die. EPPS You come up with a better plan, let me know. JAEGER Maybe...maybe if we traded them the gold.

Fear gives way to desperation.  Both men whip their steeds hard.  The beasts leap to the embankment and start the wild ride down.

Just then Wes and his men make it back down the trail, and start riding hard for Jaeger. Epps pulls his horse around and takes off for his fallen comrade.  As he rides in he leans to the side and low. Stretching out an arm Epps literally scoops Jaeger, and swings him up behind him.  A couple of rodeo performers couldn't have done it better. Problem is with the extra weight they can't go very fast. Wes and his men close hard now.  The bullets fly fast and furious swarming all around our boys. Epps whips the horse, trying to get everything she's got to give.  This is it:  They get away now, or not at all.  Their horse finds a little something extra.  She goes faster, faster... Suddenly Epps pulls up hard on the reins.  The horse rears up, she goes wild.  It takes everything Epps has to control her.  But better that than if she'd taken another stride. They've come to the edge of a very, very sharp cliff.  Epps may be a good rider for a novice, but no way he could get this beast to fly. Finally he calms the horse down, but it doesn't matter.
