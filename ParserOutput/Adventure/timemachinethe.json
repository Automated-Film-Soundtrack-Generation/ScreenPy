Only the laboratory, a converted greenhouse, is dark, shaded from the moonlight by a majestic, leafless oak. A two-horse carriage, in the style of the turn of the century, lingers in the driveway.

The glass walls are obscured from view from the garden by rows of tall growing plants.  Only the glass skylight is clear.  Thick, dark, low-hanging clouds are pass- ing beneath the moon, dimming its light and leaving the interior a maze of dark shadows.  As the slow mov- ing clouds pass overhead, a shaft of moonlight seeps through and we SEE workbenches, numerous tools, sheets of drawings and scientific instruments situated around the perimeter. But the most conspicuous object in the room is the Time Machine.  It is a duplicate of the miniature model already seen. However, its size gives it a majestic quality.  Nickel, ivory and crystalline quartz gleam and sparkle.  While the miniature possessed a delicate, appealing note, the full size Machine has an ominous look.  The wavering moonlight seems to render it alive and give it the power of movement. CLOSE ON TIME TRAVELLER - MOVING SHOT",

The once clear windows are now dirty and boarded up.  The world outside is completely obscured from view.  Only faint light penetrating cracks indicates that it is day out- doors.  He crosses to the door.  Dust falls as he opens it and enters the corridor. INT. LIBRARY                                           90 The dim light and the protective sheets covering the furnishings previously seen, lend the room a ghostly appearance.  Tilted paintings reveal faded spots on the walls and the dust is inches thick here, as well as in the dining room seen in the b.g.  Cobwebs are everywhere. The floor SQUEAKS on every footfall as the Time Traveller, coming down the steps from the corridor, enters the room and looks about. THE SHELVES - TIME TRAVELLER'S P.O.V.                  91 Among his books still rest the clocks, his once prized possessions.  There is NO TICKING now. The hands of the clocks, each pair indicating a different time, seem to guard the past. CLOSE ON TIME TRAVELLER - MOVING SHOT                  92 Curiosity takes the Time Traveller from the library, through the ENTRANCE HALL, to the front door.  It refuses to respond to his attempt to open it.  Even when he uses his shoulder it does not budge.  He steps back and flings his full weight against it and with a WRENCHING SOUND it gives slightly.  Under continued pressure the nailed boards outside give way and a flood of daylight illuminates the dusty interior.  The Time Traveller moves into the open driveway that is now taken over by weeds. EXT. COTTAGE - LONG SHOT - DAY                         93 The Time Traveller takes a deep breath and looks curiously around.  Everything is overgrown with vines and flowers.  The house is boarded up.  He starts to wander around, thinking, investigating. (NOTE:  The house is situated upon a site with distinctive landmarks that will stay recognizable during his journey into the future, thereby giving a clear conception that time-travelling does not involve geographical movement. For instance, the sharp curve of the River Thames in the distance will remain even after the house itself has disappeared.)

The continued stretch of emptiness builds up a wave of apprehension in the Time Traveller which grows as he moves along.  The apprehension mounts into tension and gradually but inevitably approaches the state of horror that a human being would experience in a strange place where he had just come from an innocent freshly set table of ripe fruits and stepped outside into a beautiful but weird vacuum.

The Time Traveller walks with continued wariness through the trees, glancing from left to right and occasionally stopping dead still and quickly darting a glance behind him at what he imagines to be some sound of movement. But all this is imaginary on his part.  There is nothing that moves or makes a sound in this forest. Suddenly he stops as he distinctly hears a familar and quite HUMAN combination of NOISES.  The SOUND SPLASHING WATER and LAUGHTER.  He hurries to some dense foliage where he stops to cautiously peer out. EXT. THE POOL - LONG SHOT - (DAY)",

Then, sud- denly remembering, he digs his free hand into the pocket of his trouser, drawing out the lever he had removed and looks at it with self-assurance. Returning the lever to his pocket, he drops to his knees and by the light of his torch, scrutinizes the grass. THE GROUND - TIME TRAVELLER'S P.O.V.                   203 The turf has been ripped in parallel grooves as though some heavy object had been dragged across.

TIME TRAVELLER - MOVING SHOT                           204 He straightens slowly, his eyes narrowed. Nervously he looks around, then steps on follow- ing the grooves. BACK TO THE FOOTPRINTS                                 205 THE CAMERA CONTINUES TO FOLLOW the grooves straight across the lawn to the flagstones around the white sphinx.  There are dark scratches on the stones leading to the wide panel in the base of the pedestal.  Here the marks end. AT THE PEDESTAL - MED. SHOT                            206 The Time Traveller pauses, then gives the panel an exploratory KNOCK.  It responds with a HOLLOW SOUND. The Time Traveller thrusts his torch between the claws of the sphinx.  With both hands now free, he tries unsuccessfully to push the panel either to right or left or up or down.  Taking a penknife from his pocket, he runs the blade around the panel's edge hunting for a secret latch.  No success. Then he pauses, searching for a tool, and sees a loosened flagstone.  He picks it up.  With this heavy weight he batters the panel.  At each blow it RESOUNDS LOUDLY, not unlike a gong.  Four times he strikes, and then on the fifth blow the rock shatters in his hands.  He stops in despair. CLOSE ON TIME TRAVELLER                                207 He senses he is under observation by an unseen presence.

TIME TRAVELLER - FULL SHOT                             211-213 He grabs his torch from the pedestal and slowly paces toward the nearest bush.  But as he ap- proaches, the glowing eyes vanish in the haze, followed by a ghostly impression of pale, fleeing creatures. The Time Traveller halts and turns in another direction.  The same thing happens. Then he has an idea.  Bending, he beats the torch against the moist soil and extinguishes it.  Now in the darkness he straightens and waits, peering around until he hears a twig CRACK, then moves into the deep shadow of a tall bush, looking off. THE PATH                                               214 Through the mist in the foliage a pale figure approaches slowly.  It emerges onto the lawn. TIME TRAVELLER - MED.

For a moment there is a struggle and then the other figure lies perfectly still.  The Time Traveller rears back to get a look at it. THE FIGURE ON THE GROUND - EXTREME CLOSE SHOT          216 It is Weena.  The moving shadow of the Time Traveller reveals her pale face, with closed eyes, wearing an expression of helpless terror.  She appears to be waiting for the inevitable end, but when it does not come, she slowly opens her eyes.  She sees the Time Traveller and her face records a wave of relief. The CAMERA WITHDRAWS TO TWO SHOT as the Time Traveller, embarrassed, helps her sit up.",

He drops his unlit torch and whirls in pain. Another whip scares Weena into the chamber of horrors, while several other whips land on the T.T.'s shoulders.

The gloom is relieved only by puffing smoke and waver- ing lights, revealing occasionally vague shapes and grotesque shadows. (NOTE:  DRIPPING WATER from the walls and THROBBING OF",

He grabs Morlock, and hangs on until he can scramble up on ledge again. He clutches at Morlock's throat, banging his head against the rock wall, finally throwing him off ledge.

She screams and jumps back, watching in terror, as the Morlock comes toward her. MED. SHOT                                              351X10 The Time Traveller comes down ramp to meet several Morlocks converging on him.  He tries to fight his way past them. CLOSE SHOT - WEENA AND YOUNG MAN                       351X11 Morlock rushes in, grabs Weena and carrying her over his shoulder starts across toward Feasting Cave. MED.

FULL SHOT                                              351X13 The Time Traveller runs to Weena, pulls her away from Morlock, knocks him against rock.  In the meantime another Morlock runs up on rock and jumps at Time Traveller, knocking him down. The second Morlock rebounds from rock and leaps on the Time Traveller and starts to choke him. CLOSE SHOT - TIME TRAVELLER                            351X14 Looks up toward YOUNG MAN - silently appeals for help. CLOSE SHOT - YOUNG MAN                                 351X15 Stancing in front of group of Eloi returns the Time Traveller's silent plea for help.  Slowly raises his right hand, stares at it as he gradually clenches it into a fist.  Then, making up his mind, raises both hands and strikes Mor- lock hard on the back of his neck. MED. SHOT                                              351X16 As Morlock relaxes his grip the Time Traveller kicks him back to rock, scrambles up and runs to get his torch.  Several Morlocks try to herd Eloi back into Feasting Cave, but led by the Young Man and his newly discovered strength, the Eloi resist them.  The Time Traveller runs back in with torch, and herd the Eloi toward stairs. FULL SHOT                                              351X17 The Time Traveller urges the Eloi up the stairs pushing Weena ahead of him.  They climb up past Cauldron.  Morlocks come in after fleeing Eloi, shielding their eyes from the light of the Time Traveller's torch. CLOSER SHOT                                            351X18 The Time Traveller looks ahead to be sure the Eloi are all on their way out.  Then turns back and drops his torch into the oil flowing into the Cauldron. FULL SHOT                                              351X19 The burning torch catches the Cauldron on fire, which quickly spreads across the floor of the Cavern, to the steaming Machine on the right, which explodes.  The Time Traveller herds Eloi out across Stone Bridge. MED. SHOT                                              351X20 Pursuing Morlock runs up steps in back of burning Cauldron hiding his face from the flames.  He bumps into the Pipe coming down the wall, loses his balance and falls into the burning Cauldron - Flames shoot higher. PAN SHOT                                               351X21 Another Morlock comes from behind machine, as fire creeps across floor, almost reaches machine at same time as fire - and it explodes.  Morlock catches fire and runs across into Feasting Cave. PASSAGEWAY - LONG SHOT                                 352 Smoke is thick as the Time Traveller and Weena run toward a circle of light on the floor far ahead. CIRCLE OF LIGHT - HIGH ANGLE                           353 Weena and the Time Traveller reach the light that comes straight down from above, and look up the shaft.  Smoke belches from the passage- way as he helps her start up the ladder and then he, himself, follows, clambering out of sight. IN THE WELL                                            354 The CAMERA FOLLOWS Weena and the Time Traveller climbing up, COUGHING from smoke.  The light becomes slowly brighter and he looks up. FROM THROAT OF WELL - LOW ANGLE                        355 Gradually the top of the well becomes visible through the swirling smoke.  The Young Man is peering down.  He reaches to help Weena and the Time Traveller. SHOOTING INTO SHAFT - HIGH ANGLE                       356 Weena and the Time Traveller are both dark with soot, near exhaustion.  Far below them red flames pierce through the smoke.  They each in turn grasp the helping hand of the Young Man and climb up out of the well. EXT. THE WELL - MED. SHOT - (SUNSET)",
