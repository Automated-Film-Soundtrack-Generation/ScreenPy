END MUSICAL NUMBER Anya does not see a cute little PUPPY (MEETOO) with a HUGE BONE in his mouth, being chased along the sidewalk by a pack of much larger, vicious DOGS until he bolts across Anya's path forcing her to skid to a stop. She watched him as he scoots into an alley, followed by the angry pack. On reflex, Anya drops the bike and reuns into the alley after him. EXT.  ALLEY - DAY Meetoo is trapped.  The PACK surrounds him, ready to pounce when Anya LEAPS into the middle of the circle. The PACK is startled, but begins to advance on both Anya and Meetoo. Anya doesn't know what to do. She crouches and then. . . growls back at them, making her eyes look as ferocious as possible. The PACK exchange a confused look; there's a girl growling at them. Meetoo stands, suddenly brave, behind her and growls along with her. Suddenly, Anya pounced toward the pack, growling louder. The pack has definately had enough - some start to back out quizzically, others turn and run like hell. Anya turns to Meetoo, who looks up at her gratefully, wagging his tail. Anya picks up the bone and puts it back in his mouth.",

Anya approaches a STERN LOOKING BUILDING with a sign over the door: \"The People's Bureau of Bureaucracy\". She leaps off her bike and heads up the stais. Meetoo, breathing heavily from his run, follows and almost reaches her when the heavy door slams in his face.  He slumps against it, panting, his little paw-to chest. INT.

Dmitri and Vladimir are surprised as Anya walks past them with confidence and throws them a look over her shoulder. \"REPRISE OF VLADIMIR'S SONG (OVER MONTAGE) The tone of the song would now change - - the older, wiser person watching as two younger people are unwittingly falling in love. The tone can still be light, as are the visuals here, but there would be an undercurrent of irony and romance. The song would end as Anya and Dmitri have their first, momentary embrace. MONTAGE: (MOS) ON DECK: Anya, still in her boots, walks gracefully down the deck in spite of the ship's rocking motion. Dmitri and Vlad can't even stand due to the motion. Anya looks back and flashes them a smile. IN THEIR CABIN: Dmitri gets out of the bed he's been sharing with Vlad and walks over, past where Anya is sleeping peacefully, to close the port hole against a cold wind. He closes is and see's Anya - she looks beautiful - he bends down to pull up her covers and she SLUGS him. UNDER A TABLE: Meetoo is walking around sniffing feet. Suddenly, he runs smack into the TWO UGLY PUG DOGS who growl at him. He runs away and finally see's a woman's foot and a pair of pretty feminine shoes, with heels, that she has kicked off. Meetoo grabs them in his mouth and runs. ON DECK: The sea is calm, but Anya - wearing the heeled shoes for the first time - is teetering and wobbling like mad. Dmitri and Vlad watch her with amusement. Anya turns to them. ON DECK: Dmitri has stuffed his feet into the woman's shoes and is barely able to walk as Anya watches him with great vindication. BALLROOM: Anya walks -into the ballroom, steady and graceful in her new shoes, on Vladimir's arm and completes a perfect curtsy in front of Dmitri. Dmitri applauds and moves down to her as she stands and smacks him with her head accidently. THEIR CABIN: Vladimir is directing Anya as she waltzes gracefully in their swaying cabin. Dmitri enters and is directed to join Anya. He does and they dance together, with Anya clearly leading. The boat sways to the left and Anya is thrown closer into Dmitri's arms. Neither of them even try to readjust. END MONTAGE STILL IN THE SCENE Vladimir walks over to Anya and nervously chatters (he knows he interrupted something) as he leads her away from Dmitri.",

She reaches down to pick some pretty flowers, then looks up as it seems to get dark... OMINOUS LOOKING CLOUDS cover the sun. Anya reaches down for another flower when she HEARS A GROWL. Anya spins to see an ENORMOUS BEAR emerge from the trees. (All the animals in the dream sequence have a SLIGHT resemblance to Rasputin.) Anya is frozen with fear as MORE BEARS emerge and head straight for her. She tries to back away as the beautiful FLOWERS GROW LONG AND HORRIBLE THORNS and wrap around her ankles, impeding her escape. It gets darker as the BEAR'S EYES, glowing yellow, multiply and move closer. Anya pulls free of the flowers and rushes to the safety of a large tree  She climbs the tree and escapesthe bears. Looking down, from her perch on a sturdy branch, the ground seems miles away. Suddenly, the BRANCH JOLTS her and almost falling, she hold on to it tightly. But the branch TURNS IN TOWARD HER - no longer a tree branch, but A HUGE UGLY SNAKE with red eyes and huge fangs that come right for her! Anya leaps to another branch, which also turns into a snake. She jolts backward and begins to fall ... toward a HUNDRED YELLOW EYES, FIFTY BLOOD RED MOUTHS AND THOUSANDS OF SHARP TEETH. As Anya falls, she lets out a SILENT SCREAM. A BURST OF SUNLIGHT as Anya lands in a field of soft GOLDEN WHEAT. Unharmed and very relieved, she stands and looks around at the beautiful sunny wheat field. INT. CABIN Reality. Anya's eyes are closed as she smiles in her sleep and sits up in bed. TINY WISPS of smoke still swirl around her head. As she gets out of bed, she unintentionally steps on Meetoo's tail, waking him. Meetoo watches as the sleeping Anya opens the cabin door and walks out. Meetoo rises to follow Anya but the ship pitches, sending him sliding across the cabin floor. EXT. DECK - NIGHT Anya walks out on the deck, the ship pitching violently in the storm, as she smiles. IN HER DREAM Anya is walking through the wheat field to the edge of a BLUFF. A few yards below the bluff, Anya sees a beautiful little pond where a FAMILY frolic's in the clear water; laughing, splashing, swiming happily. Anya climbs over a low flowering wall to look closer. PULL BACK REALITY: Anya has climbed over the railing of the deck and is looking into the black ocean... smiling. DISSOLVE TO: A SMOKY IMAGE OF THE SAME SCENE It's RASPUTIN'S POV as he watches his plan unfold in the reliquary. INT. CABIN Meetoo finally rights himself from his slide across the floor and begins to bark into Dmitri's ear. EXT. DECK Anya is waving happily at the dangerous water. IN HER DREAM Anya is waving to the FAMILY. They turn around toward her and she sees that it's the ROMONOV FAMILY, from the frieze that she saw in the palace. She is delighted to see them as she feels a distance recollection of who they are to her. INT. CABIN Meetoo jumps up and NIPS at Dmitri's hand. Dmitri leaps up with an \"owwww!\" and looks over at the excited Meetoo.",

On the streets they encounter the motley denizens of Paris, as well as people with very familiar faces -- for anyone in the audience in the know, they'll see Josephine Baker, Maurice Chevalier, Rodin, Gertrude Stein, Freud, Lindbergh - people who were in Paris in the twenties.. For those in the audience who don't recognize them, they'll simply be unidentified fascinating \"types\" who SING. As the joyous number progresses, we realize that Dmitri is feeling something else -- the impending loss of Anya to a world where she clearly is at home. He SINGS for a short moment, knowing that he's about to lose her. Anya visits a couturier and comes out with a big dress box for her evening at the ballet. A BIG FINALE as they go off for the evening. Even Meetoo has found some female poodle companionship. But for one last beat, Dmitri's wistfulness cuts against joy. END MUSICAL NUMBER EXT.
