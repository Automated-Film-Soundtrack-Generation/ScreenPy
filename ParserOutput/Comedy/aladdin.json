(She cuddles with RAJAH, enjoying the moment, until she looks up at her angry father. ) Ahem. SULTAN: Dearest, you've got to stop rejecting every suitor that comes to call.  The law says you... BOTH:       ...must be married to a prince. (They walk over to a dove cage.) SULTAN: By your next birthday. JASMINE:    The law is wrong. SULTAN: You've only got three more days! JASMINE:    Father,  I hate being forced into this.  (She takes a dove out of the cage and pets it.) If I do marry, I want it to be for love. SULTAN: Jasmine, it's not only this law.  (She hands him the dove, and he puts it back in the cage.) I'm not going to be around forever, and I just want to make sure you're taken care of, provided for. JASMINE:    Try to understand.  I've never done a thing on my own. (She swirls her finger in the water of the pond, petting the fish.)I've never had any real friends. (RAJAH looks up at her and growls.) Except you, Rajah.  (Satisfied, he goes back to sleep.)  I've never even been outside the palace walls. SULTAN: But Jasmine, you're a princess. JASMINE:    Then maybe I don't want to be a princess.  (She splashes the water.) SULTAN: Oooohhh!  Allah forbid you should have any daughters! (RAJAH looks up and thinks for a second.  JASMINE goes to the dove cage and yanks open the door.  The birds fly off into freedom. She watches them go.  Cut to int. of SULTAN's chambers.) SULTAN: I don't know where she gets it from.  Her mother wasn't nearly so picky.  (A shadow falls over him. He looks up startled and sees JAFAR.)  Ooh, oh. Ah, Jafar--my most trusted advisor.  I am in desperate need of your wisdom. JAFAR:  My life is but to serve you, my lord.  (He bows.) SULTAN: It's this suitor business.  Jasmine refuses to choose a husband.  I'm at my wit's-end. IAGO:   (In the parrot voice) Awk!  Wit's-end. SULTAN: Oh, ha ha.  Have a cracker, pretty polly!  (He pulls a cracker out from his pocket.  IAGO looks terrified.  Then the SULTAN stuffs it in IAGO's mouth.  IAGO grimaces as he tries to eat it.  JAFAR and the SULTAN both laugh.) JAFAR:  Your majesty certainly has a way with dumb animals. (IAGO glares at him.)  Now then, perhaps I can divine a solution to this thorny problem. SULTAN: If anyone can help, it's you. JAFAR:  Ah, but it would require the use of the mystic blue diamond. SULTAN: Uh, my ring?  But it's been in the family for years. JAFAR:  It is necessary to find the princess a suitor. (JAFAR says the word 'princess' with the accent on the second syllable, \"cess.\"  He turns his staff with a cobra head towards the SULTAN.  The eyes of the staff begin to glow. The room darkens, JAFAR's voice slows down and deepens.  The SULTAN's eyes get a hypnotized look.)  Don't worry.  Everything will be fine. SULTAN: Everything...will be...fine. JAFAR:  The diamond. SULTAN: Here, Jafar. Whatever you need will be fine. (The SULTAN removes his ring and hands it to JAFAR. The room returns to normal as JAFAR pulls back the staff.) JAFAR:  You are most gracious, my liege.  Now run along and play with your little toys. SULTAN: (Still hypnotized)  Yes...that'll be...pretty good. (JAFAR and IAGO exit.  We follow them. When they're out of the room, the parrot spits out the cracker.) IAGO:       I can't take it anymore!  If I gotta choke down on one more of those moldy, disgusting crackers...bam! Whack! (JAFAR pulls a rope, which reveals a hidden entrance to his chambers.) JAFAR:  Calm yourself, Iago. IAGO:       Then I'd grab him around the head.  Whack! Whack! JAFAR:  (Speaking over IAGO.)  Soon, I will be sultan, not that addlepated twit. IAGO:       And then I stuff the crackers down his throat!  Ha ha! (The pair pass through a door and slam it shut.  Diss. to ext. gardens at night.  A shadowy figure walks through.  We see it is JASMINE in disguise.  She reaches the palace wall, then begins to climb it. She is tugged from behind by RAJAH.) JASMINE:    Oh, I'm sorry, Rajah.  But I can't stay here and have my life lived for me.  I'll miss you.(She begins to climb again, and is helped up by RAJAH, who begins to whine and whimper.)  Good bye! (She disappears over the wall. Cut to daytime on the street  ALADDIN and ABU are up to their capers again.  They are on top of the awning of a fruit stand.) ALADDIN:        Okay, Abu.  Go! (ABU dips over the edge and looks at the PROPRIETOR.) PROPRIETOR: (To passing crowd)  Try this, your taste buds will dance and sing. (ABU grabs a melon and hangs there, distracting his attention.)  Hey, get your paws off that. ABU:            Blah blah blah! PROPRIETOR: Why, you!  Get away from here, you filthy ape! (He grabs the melon away from ABU.  But in the foreground, ALADDIN dips down and snatches another melon from the stand.) ABU:            Bye bye! (He zings back up.  The PROPRIETOR takes the melon to the front, where he places it on top of a stack.  He looks confused, like he has just done this.) ALADDIN:    Nice goin' Abu.  Breakfast is served. (ALADDIN and ABU on the roof break open the melon and eat.  We see J ASMINE walking through the street.) SHOPKEEPER 1:   Pretty lady, buy a pot.  No finer pot in brass or silver. SHOPKEEPER 2:   Sugar dates, sugar dates and figs!  Sugar dates and pistachios! SHOPKEEPER 3:   Would the lady like a necklace.  A pretty necklace for a pretty lady. (She is charmed by the action, but is startled by a fish thrust into her face.) SHOPKEEPER 4:   Fresh fish!  We catch 'em, you buy 'em! JASMINE:    I don't think so.  (She backs away, but bumps into a fire eater, who is startled into swallowing his fire.)  Oh, excuse me.  (He gulps, then belches fire from his mouth.  JASMINE is disgusted.  He is pleased and taps his stomach.  ALADDIN sees her, and a strange look comes over his face.)  I'm really very sorry. ALADDIN:    (He's obviously deeply in love with her.)  Wow! (She pulls the hood of her cloak over her head.  ABU sees him and jumps up on his shoulder, waving his hand in front of ALADDIN's face.) ABU:        Uh oh.  Hello?  Hello? (JASMINE stops at the fruit stand and sees a young homeless child reaching for a piece of fruit.  She picks one up and gives it to him.) JASMINE:        Oh, you must be hungry.  Here you go.  (The boy runs off.) PROPRIETOR: You'd better be able to pay for that. JASMINE:        (Mystified) Pay? PROPRIETOR: No one steals from my cart! JASMINE:        Oh, I'm sorry sir.  I don't have any money. PROPRIETOR: Thief! JASMINE:        Please, if you let me go to the palace, I can get some from the Sultan. PROPRIETOR: Do you know what the penalty is for stealing? (He takes her hand and pins it down on the table, intending to chop it off.) JASMINE:        No, no please! (The sword drops, but his hand is stopped by ALADDIN's.) ALADDIN:        Thank you kind sir.  I'm so glad you've found her. I've been looking all over for you. JASMINE:        (whispering) What are you doing? ALADDIN:        (whispering back) Just play along. PROPRIETOR: You know this girl? JASMINE:        Sadly, yes.  She is my sister.  She's a little crazy.  (He circles his finger around his ear. She is shocked.  The PROPRIETOR grabs him by the vest.) PROPRIETOR: She said she knows the Sultan! ALADDIN:        She thinks the monkey is the Sultan. (ABU is picking a pocket.  He hears this, then straightens up. JASMINE, playing along, kneels and bows to ABU.) JASMINE:        Oh, wise Sultan.  How may I serve you? ABU:            Well, blah blah blah blah. ALADDIN:        Tragic, isn't it?  (He leans forward, picking up another apple from the cart with his foot.) But, no harm done.  (Walks over to Jasmine.)  Now come along sis. Time to see the doctor. JASMINE:        (To a camel standing nearby) Oh, hello doctor. How are you? ALADDIN:        No, no, no. Not that one. (To ABU, whose pockets are bulging.) Come on, Sultan. (ABU bows to the crowd and everything he's stolen from the cart falls out.) PROPRIETOR: Huh?  What is it?  (ABU picks up what he can carry, and the trio run off.) Come back here, you little thieves! (Cut to int. of JAFAR's lab.  IAGO is running on a gear in a bizarre contraption.  At the top of the contraption is a storm brewing.) IAGO:       (huffing and puffing)  With all due respect, your rottenness, couldn't we just wait for a real storm? JAFAR:  Save your breath, Iago.  Faster!  (He places the SULTAN's ring in the contraption.) IAGO:       Yes, o mighty evil one. (IAGO runs faster.  A lightning bolt streaks through the ring, passing into an hourglass below.  The sands begin to swirl.) JAFAR:  Ah, sands of time--reveal to me the one who can enter the cave.  (The sand in top forms the Cave of Wonders.  It falls through into a storm, but it shows ALADDIN climbing up a ladder, followed by",

(IAGO loses his footing and is sucked into the gears.) JAFAR:  Let's have the guards extend him an invitation to the palace, shall we? (IAGO goes flying past and slams into the wall upside down.) IAGO:   Swell. (JAFAR laughs hideously, and the camera zooms in on the sandstorm with ALADDIN in it.  Finally, we dissolve into the real ALADDIN climbing to the top of the ladder, followed by JASMINE.) ALADDIN:    Almost there. (JASMINE climbs over the top, but trips and falls into ALADDIN's arms. She stands up.) JASMINE:    I want to thank you for stopping that man. ALADDIN:    Uh, forget it.  (He grabs a pole.)  So, uh, this is your first time in the marketplace, huh? (ALADDIN pole vaults to the next building, leaving JASMINE behind.) JASMINE:    Is it that obvious? ALADDIN:    Well, you do kinda stand out.  (He stares at her, still in love.  She returns the look.  But he realizes what he is doing, and returns to normal.) I mean, uh, you don't seem to know how dangerous Agrabah can be. (He lays a plank between the buildings for her to walk over, but as he is leaned down, she vaults over his head.  He looks back in surprise.  She tosses the pole to him.  Both ALADDIN's and ABU's eyes bulge.) JASMINE:    I'm a fast learner. ALADDIN:    Right.  C'mon, this way.  (They go inside the roof of a building, dodging planks and beams as they go.)  Whoa.  Watch your head there.  Be careful. JASMINE:    Is this where you live? ALADDIN:    Yep.  Just me and Abu.  Come and go as we please. JASMINE:    Fabulous. ALADDIN:    Well, it's not much, (he pulls back the curtain and exposes the palace) but it's got a great view. Palace looks pretty amazing, huh? JASMINE:    Oh, it's wonderful. ALADDIN:    I wonder what it would be like to live there, to have servants and valets... JASMINE:    Oh, sure.   People who tell you where to go and how to dress. ALADDIN:    It's better than here.  Always scraping for food and ducking the guards. JASMINE:    You're not free to make your own choices. ALADDIN:    Sometimes you feel so-- JASMINE:    You're just-- BOTH:       (in unison) --trapped. (They look at each other, realizing that they're perfect for one another.  But ALADDIN then realizes where he is, and breaks the look.  He takesthe apple out of ABU's hand and rolls it down his arm into the hand of JASMINE.) ALADDIN:    So, where're you from? JASMINE:    What does it matter?  I ran away, and I am not going back. ALADDIN:    Really?  (He takes a bite from the apple in his hand, then hands it to ABU, who has a disgusted look on his face.) ABU:        Why you! (ALADDIN walks over and sits next to JASMINE.) JASMINE:    My father's forcing me to get married. ALADDIN:    That's--that's awful.  (ABU appears from behind the princess and tries to steal the apple.) Abu! (ABU races up to a higher point, chattering and cursing as he goes.) JASMINE:    What? ALADDIN:    Abu says that--uh--that's not fair. ABU:        What? JASMINE:    Oh did he? ALADDIN:    Yeah, of course. JASMINE:    And does Abu have anything else to say? ALADDIN:    Well, uh, he wishes there was something he could do to help. ABU:        Oh, boy! JASMINE:    Hmm, tell him that's very sweet. (ALADDIN and JASMINE have been getting closer and closer, until ALADDIN leans in to kiss her.  He is interrupted, however, by the GUARDS, who have found them.) GUARD:  Here you are! ALADDIN and JASMINE:    They've found me!  (To each other) They're after you? JASMINE:    My father must have sent them-- ALADDIN:    Do you trust me? JASMINE:    What? ALADDIN:    Do you trust me? (He extends his hand) JASMINE:    Yes. (She takes it.) ALADDIN:    Then jump! (They both jump off the roof, fall and land in a pile of salt.  They try to get away, but the exit is blocked by a GUARD.) GUARD:  We just keep running into each other, don't we, street rat? (Again, the GUARD's turban is pulled down by ABU, but more guards are here and block the exit.  The first GUARD pulls ABU off his head and throws him in a vase.  Three other GUARDS grab ALADDIN.) GUARD:  It's the dungeon for you, boy. ALADDIN:    Hey, get off of me! JASMINE:    Let go of him. GUARD:  (Not realizing she is the princess) Look what we have here, men--a street mouse.  (He throws her down.) JASMINE:    (standing up and pulling off the hood of her cloak) Unhand him, by order of the princess. (The GUARDS suddenly stop and bow, forcing ALADDIN to bow as well.) GUARD:  Princess Jasmine. ALADDIN:    The princess? ABU:        (peeking out from the vase) The princess? GUARD:  What are you doing outside the palace?  And with this street rat? JASMINE:    That's not your concern.  Do as I command.  Release him! GUARD:  Well, I would, princess, but my orders come from Jafar.  You'll have to take it up with him. (The GUARDS drag ALADDIN out, bowing as they go.) JASMINE:    (getting a very pissed-off look) Believe me, I will. (Cut to int. of palace, JAFAR emerging from his secret chambers.  He slides the door shut carefully, but the princess comes storming in before he is finished.  He slams it shut, pinning IAGO inside the door frame.) JASMINE:    Jafar? JAFAR:  Oh, uh, princess. IAGO:       Awk! Jafar, I'm stuck! JAFAR:  How may I be of service to you? (He spreads out his cape, hiding the door.) JASMINE:    The guards just took a boy from the market, on your orders. JAFAR:  Your father's charged me with keeping peace in Agrabah.  The boy was a criminal. JASMINE:    What was the crime? IAGO:       I can't breathe, Jafar! JAFAR:  Why, kidnapping the princess, of course. IAGO:       If you could just--(JAFAR kicks him back inside the door and it slams shut)--wow, that hurt! JASMINE:    He didn't kidnap me! I ran away! JAFAR:  (Walking away as if shocked) Oh, dear!  Oh, why frightfully upsetting.  Had I but known. JASMINE:    What do you mean? JAFAR:  Sadly, the boy's sentence has already been carried out. JASMINE:    What sentence? JAFAR:  (with a sinister tone)  Death.  (JASMINE gasps.) By beheading. JASMINE:    No!  (She collapses to the floor.) JAFAR:  I am exceedingly sorry, princess. JASMINE:    How could you?  (She runs from the room crying.) (IAGO finally makes it out through the door.  He flies up and lands on JAFAR's shoulder, coughing.) IAGO:       So, how did  it go? JAFAR:  I think she took it rather well.  (They both get a sinister smile on their faces.) (Diss. to JASMINE at night, crying at the edge of the fountain.  RAJAH comes over to comfort her.  She pets him.) JASMINE:    It's all my fault, Rajah.  I didn't even know his name. (Cut to int. of dungeon.  Rats scurry by, and we descend until we see ALADDIN chained to the wall.) ALADDIN:    (to himself) She was the princess.  I don't believe it.  I must have sounded so stupid to her. ABU:        (from a distance) Yoo-hoo!  Aladdin? Hello! (ABU appears at the window at the top of the dungeon.) ALADDIN:    Abu!  Down here!  Hey, c'mon--help me outta these. (ABU stops, then begins chattering wildly, dropping to the ground.  He wraps a cloth around his head and makes his eyes big in an imitation of the princess.) ALADDIN:    Hey, she was in trouble.  Ah, she was worth it. (ABU jumps up on ALADDIN's shoulders and pulls a small set of tools out of his pocket, then frees ALADDIN.) ABU:        Yeah, yeah, yeah. ALADDIN:    Don't worry, Abu.  I'll never see her again.  I'm a street rat, remember, and there's a law. She's gotta marry a prince, she deserves it. (ABU finally frees ALADDIN's hands.) ABU:        Ta da! ALADDIN:    (Rubbing his wrists) I'm a--I'm a fool OLD MAN:    You're only a fool if you give up, boy. (We see an OLD MAN sitting in the corner that neither ALADDIN nor ABU have seen before.) ALADDIN:    Who are you? OLD MAN:    A lowly prisoner, like yourself.  But together, perhaps we can be more. ALADDIN:    I'm listening. OLD MAN:    There is a cave, boy.  A cave of wonders.  Filled with treasures beyond your wildest dreams. Treasure enough to impress even your princess, I'd wager. (Listeners will note that the OLD MAN pronounced the word 'princess' as \"prin-CESS\" rather than the standard pronunciation of \"PRIN-cess.\"   The OLD MAN turns his back, and IAGO sticks his head out of JAFAR's \"old man\" disguise.) IAGO:       Jafar, can ya hurry it up?  I'm dyin' in here! ALADDIN:    But the law says that only a prince can marry-- OLD MAN:    You've heard of the golden rule, haven't you boy? Whoever has the gold makes the rules.(He grins, showing a hideously bad mouth.) ALADDIN:    So why would you share all of this wonderful treasure with me? OLD MAN:    I need a young man with strong legs and a strong back to go in after it. ALADDIN:    Ah, one problem.  It's out there, we're in here? (The OLD MAN walks to a wall and pushes open a hidden exit.) OLD MAN:    Mmm, mmm, mmm.,  Things aren't always what they seem.  So, do we have a deal? (ALADDIN looks at ABU, who shrugs his shoulders.) ABU:        Oh, hmm. (Cut to desert scene.  We see ALADDIN leading a horse with the OLD MAN and ABU on it.  Diss. to cave of wonders.) CAVE:       Who disturbs my slumber? ALADDIN:    It is I, Aladdin. CAVE:       Proceed.  Touch nothing but the lamp. (The cave opens up with a roar, and a staircase appears in front of ALADDIN. ) OLD MAN:    Remember, boy--first fetch me the lamp, and then you shall have your reward. ALADDIN:    C'mon, Abu.  (to ABU hiding under the shoulder of his vest.) (ALADDIN begins to descend the staircase.  He reaches the bottom and enters a golden chamber filled with treasure.) ALADDIN:    Would ya look at that! ABU:        Uh oh! ALADDIN:    Just a handful of this stuff would make me richer than the sultan! (ABU peeks out, sees the treasure, then bolts for it.) ALADDIN:    Abu! (ABU stops in mid run, hovering over a rug on the floor.) ALADDIN:    Don't...touch...anything!  We gotta find that lamp. (They begin to make their way through the room when the CARPET rises off the floor and begins following them.  ABU gets the feeling they're being followed.) ABU:        Huh? (He turns, and the CARPET lies flat on the floor.  He continues, and the CARPET begins to follow again.  Again, ABU turns back, but the CARPET is rolled up and leaning against a pile of treasure. ABU runs to ALADDIN and tugs his pant leg.) ABU:        Aladdin!  Aladdin! ALADDIN:    Abu, will ya knock it off? (Again the CARPET follows, but this time, when ABU turns, the carpet jumps to the other side.  It reaches down with a tassel and pulls ABU's tail.  When ABU jumps around, CARPET again goes to the other side.  This time, ABU lands in a karate stance.  CARPET reaches down and plucks ABU's hat off, then puts it on himself.  ABU sits thinking for a second, until CARPET waves a tassel in front of his face.  ABU and CARPET both jump scared, and run away.  ABU tackles ALADDIN and turns his head to look at the CARPET.) ALADDIN:    Abu, what are you--crazy? (The CARPET peeks out from behind a pile of treasure.) ALADDIN:    A magic carpet!  C'mon.  C'mon out.  I'm not gonna hurt you. (The CARPET slowly comes out, shyly, then picks up ABU's hat and dusts it off.  It flies over to ALADDIN and hands the hat to ABU next to him.  ABU screeches, and jumps onto ALADDIN's shoulder.) ALADDIN:    Take it easy, Abu.  He's not gonna bite. (The CARPET again picks up ABU's hat and hands it to him.  ABU shakes his fist and screeches at it.  CARPET begins to walk away, \"sadly.\") ALADDIN:    Hey, wait a minute.  Don't go.  Maybe you can help us.  (CARPET looks back, excited. It then flies over and wraps around the pair.)  Hey, whoa!  You see, we're trying to find this lamp.  (CARPET motions for them to follow it.)  I think he knows where it is. (They pass through a long cave, until they emerge in a giant underground cavern.  In the centre of the room is a tall pillar, with a staircase going up to it.  It is surrounded by water with unevenly placed stones forming a bridge.  At the top of the pillar is a beam of light.  ALADDIN begins to cross the bridge.) ALADDIN:    Wait here! ABU:        Oh.  Huh? (ABU sees a shrine with a golden monkey.  The outstretched paws hold a giant ruby.  ABU is hypnotically drawn to it.   ALADDIN climbs the stairs quickly.  CARPET sees ABU and grabs his tail trying in vain to hold him back.  ALADDIN finally reaches the MAGIC LAMP.) ALADDIN:    This is it?  This is what we came all the way down here to--  (He looks down and sees ABU break free of CARPET's hold and lunge toward the jewel.)  Abu-",

CAVE VOICE: You have touched the forbidden treasure.  (ABU places the jewel back into the paw, but the jewel and the shrine melt into lava.) Now you will never again see the light of day! (ALADDIN races down the steps, but they flatten into a ramp, and he skies down until he flies into the air.  The water has turned into lava.  He is falling toward it, when all of a sudden CARPET appears and catches him.   ABU is standing on one of the rocks of the bridge. He looks left and right and sees rocks exploding into lava. Then CARPET races over and ALADDIN grabs him, just as the last rock is exploding.) ALADDIN:    Whoa!  Carpet, let's move! (Together, they race back through the caves dodging walls and falling debris.  ABU grabs ALADDIN's head and covers his eyes.) ALADDIN:    Abu, this is no time to panic!  (He pulls ABU off his head and sees they are flying into a wall.) Start panicking. (CARPET goes into a dive, then through another cave.  Finally, they emerge through the internal entrance.  Outside, the cave begins to growl and close.  CARPET and company are almost to the top when a boulder drops on carpet, sending it to the floor.  ALADDIN  grabs onto the rock wall and holds on.  He sees the OLD MAN at the top, within reach.) ALADDIN:    Help me out! OLD MAN:    Throw me the lamp! ALADDIN:    I can't hold on.  Give me your hand. OLD MAN:    First give me the lamp! (ALADDIN reaches in and pulls out the MAGIC LAMP.  He hands it up, a nd the OLD MAN raises it above his head.) OLD MAN:    Ha ha ha ha!  Yes!  At last!  Ha ha ha ha! (ALADDIN has climbed out with the assistance of ABU.  But the OLD MAN kicks aside ABU and grabs ALADDIN's wrist.) ALADDIN:    What are you doing? OLD MAN:    Giving you your reward.  (JAFAR returns to his normal voice.) Your eternal reward. (He pulls out a crooked dagger and is about to stab ALADDIN, when ABU bites him on the wrist.  He screams, but lets go of ALADDIN, who falls into the cave.  OLD MAN throws ABU into the cave as well.  They fall.  CARPET sees this, but is pinned under a boulder.  It struggles to break free, then does.  It races up and catches ALADDIN, but he has already hit the wall several times, and is unconscious.  On the surface, the cave roars one final time, then sinks back into the sand.  JAFAR pulls off his disguise.) JAFAR:  Heh heh heh! It's mine.  It's all mine! I (He can't find it in his pocket)--- where is it?  No. NO!! (Kiss fade to JASMINE's bedroom.  She is sitting on her bed, next to RAJAH who looks sad. The SULTAN walks in.) SULTAN: Jasmine?  Oh, dearest.  What's wrong? JASMINE:    Jafar...has...done something... terrible.  (She looks as if she's been crying.) SULTAN: There, there, there, my child--we'll set it right. Now, tell me everything. (Cut to int. of cave.  ALADDIN lies unconscious on the CARPET. ABU tries to wake him.) ABU:        Oh, oh. Aladdin?  Wake up.  Aladdin. (CARPET rises up, lifting ALADDIN up.  He awakes slowly.) ALADDIN:    Oh, my head. (He looks at the entrance sealed in.) We're trapped.  (Angry, shaking his fists at the entrance) That two faced son-of-a-jackal!  (Calmer) Whoever he was, he's long gone with that lamp. ABU:        Aha! (ABU pulls out the MAGIC LAMP.) ALADDIN:    Why, you hairy little thief!  Looks like such a beat-up, worthless piece of junk.  Hey, I think there's something written here, but it's hard to make out. (He rubs the LAMP.  Suddenly smoke comes out of the hole, the LAMP begins to shake and glow, but ALADDIN holds onto the LAMP, and our wonderful friend, the GENIE comes out.) GENIE:  Aaaaahhhhh!  OY!  Ten-thousand years will give ya such a crick in the neck!  (He hangs ALADDIN on a nearby rock.  Then he pulls his head off and spins it around, yelling as he does so.  CARPET pulls a",

(A neon sign lights up with ALADDIN's name on it, circled by chase lights.  The sign changes to reflect the GENIE's upcoming line.) Hello, Aladdin.  Nice to have you on the show.  Can we call you 'Al?' Or maybe just 'Din?'  Or how bout 'Laddi?'  (GENIE disappears, then a dog wrapped in plaid jumps in.) Sounds like 'Here, boy! C'mon, Laddi!' ALADDIN:    (Shaking his head) I must have hit my head harder than I thought. GENIE:  (Still a dog) Do you smoke?  Mind if I do? (Dog poofs into smoke, then back to the GENIE.  ABU screeches wildly.)  Oh, sorry Cheetah--hope I didn't singe the fur!  Hey, Rugman!  Haven't seen you in a few millennia!  Slap me some tassel!  Yo! Yeah!

Look at me from the side--do I look different to you? ALADDIN:    Wait a minute!  I'm--your master? GENIE:  (Slaps a diploma in ALADDIN's hand and a mortarboard on his head.)  That's right!  He can be taught!! What would you wish of me, (as Arnold Schwarzenegger)  the ever impressive,(inside a cube) the long contained, (as a ventriloquist with a dummy) often imitated, (tosses the dummy aside) but never duplicated-- (He multiplies into multiple GENIES who surround him.) DUP. GENIES:    Duplicated, duplicated,  duplicated, duplicated,  duplicated,  duplicated, duplicated, duplicated, duplicated. GENIE:  (Says it like a ring announcer at a boxing match.) Genie!  Of!  The Lamp!  (Goes into Ed Sullivan)  Right here direct from the lamp, right here for your enjoyment wish fulfillment. Thank youuuuu! ALADDIN:    Whoa!  Wish fulfillment? GENIE:  Three wishes to be exact.  And ix-nay on the wishing for more wishes.  (Turns into a slot machine, arm pulls down and three GENIEs appear in the windows.)  That's it--three.  (Three GENIE caballeros come out of the slot.)  Uno, dos, tres. (Changes into b/w Groucho Marx.)  No substitutions, exchanges or refunds.  (The duck drops with the secret word \"Refunds.' ALADDIN:    (To ABU) Now I know I'm dreaming. GENIE:  (Music for \"Friend Like Me\" begins) Master, I don't think you quite realize what you've got here! So why don't you just ruminate, whilst I illuminate the possibilities.  (GENIE lights up like a fluorescent light) Well Ali Baba had them forty thieves Scheherazadie had a thousand tales But master you in luck 'cause up your sleeve You got a brand of magic never fails! (GENIE produces 40 thieves who surround ALADDIN with swords. GENIE appears in his vest, then sticks his arms out and boxes the thieves into submission.) You got some power in your corner now Some heavy ammunition in your camp You got some punch, pizzazz, yahoo and how See all you gotta do is rub that lamp And I'll say (Boxing ring appears, ALADDIN in the corner, being massaged by GENIE.  Then GENIE turns into a pile of fireworks and explodes.  Then GENIE appears inside lamp and grabs ALADDIN's hand and rubs lamp with it.) Mister Aladdin sir What will your pleasure be? Let me take your order, jot it down You ain't never had a friend like me No no no! (GENIE produces a table and chairs, then writes down things on a note pad, like a waiter. ) Life is your restaurant And I'm your maitre' d! C'mon whisper what it is you want You ain't never had a friend like me. (GENIE appears as a plate of chicken, then returns to normal, but enlarges his ear to listen to ALADDIN.  Finally, he explodes into four duplicate GENIEs.) Yes sir, we pride ourselves on service You're the boss, the king, the shah! Say what you wish, it's yours!  True dish How about a little more Baklava? (The GENIEs give him a shave, haircut and manicure, then ALADDIN appears in a comfy chair (eh?)  surrounded by the treasure and being fanned by women.  The GENIE appears and fills the screen with baklava.) Try some of column 'A' Try all of column 'B' I'm in the mood to help you dude You ain't never had a friend like me (ALADDIN rises up on a column of food with a giant A on top, then jumps to another column with a B on top.  He falls off and is caught by a cushion held by GENIE.  He opens his mouth, and his tongue turns into a staircase.  A miniature GENIE dressed like a magician comes out.) (The mini GENIE does a little dance with the GENIE's two giant hands.  At the end, they surround the mini GENIE and squish him into nothing.) Can your friends do this? Do your friends do that? Do your friends pull this out their little hat Can your friends go poof! Well looky here Can your friends go Abracadabra, let 'er rip And then make the sucker disappear? (The GENIE pulls off his head, duplicates it, then juggles them. He tosses them to ALADDIN, who juggles with one hand and spins one of the heads on his fingertip like a basketball.  He tosses the heads back onto the GENIE, who proceeds to try and pull himself out of a hat at his base.  He spirals around and around until he turns into a white rabbit.  The rabbit transforms into a purple dragon (very reminiscent of Figment from EPCOT Center). The dragon breathes fire, which turns into three HAREM GIRLS, who dance around ALADDIN.  Just as he begins to enjoy them, they disappear.) So don't you sit there slack jawed, buggy eyed I'm here to answer all your midday prayers You got me bona fide, certified You got a genie for a charg? d'affairs! I got a powerful urge to help you out So what you wish I really want to know You got a wish that's three miles long, no doubt So all you gotta do is rub like so, and oh! (GENIE imitates what he is calling ALADDIN, then turns into a certificate which rolls up and surrounds ALADDIN.  GENIE pulls a list {written in Arabic} out of ALADDIN's ear, which he uses to rub his behind like drying off after a shower.) Mister Aladdin, sir, have a wish or two or three I'm on the job, you big nabob You ain't never had a friend, never had a friend You ain't never had a friend, never had a friend You ain't never...had a... friend... like...me! You ain't never had a friend like me! (The dancing HAREM GIRLS reappear, and ALADDIN leans in to kiss one. She turns into the GENIE, who zaps four dancing elephants into existence.  To the other direction, he zaps in four dancing camels, and a grand finale dancing number ensues.  ABU grabs as much gold as he can, but the GENIE wraps everything up in a cyclone and zaps it away until they're all back in the cave.  GENIE has a neon \"APPLAUSE\" sign on his back. ABU turns his hat over and sees that is is empty.) GENIE:  So what'll it be, master? ALADDIN:    You're gonna grant me any three wishes I want? GENIE:  (As William F. Buckley) Ah, almost.  There are a few provisos, a couple of quid pro quos ALADDIN:    Like? GENIE:  Ah, rule number one: I can't kill anybody.  (He slices his head off with his finger.)  So don't ask.  Rule two: I can't make anyone fall in love with anyone else.  (Head turns into a big pair of lips which kiss ALADDIN.)  You little punim, there. (Lies flat, then gets up and transforms into a zombie.) Rule three: I can't bring people back from the dead.  It's not a pretty picture, (He grabs",

What do you need? Poof! What do you need?\"  To be my own master, such a thing would be greater than all the magic and all the treasures in all  the world! But what am I talking about, here?

ALADDIN:    No, really, I promise.  (He pushes the nose back in and GENIE's head returns to normal.) After make my first two wishes, I'll use my third wish to set you free.

MAJOR:  Hey, clear the way in the old bazaar, Hey you, let us through, it's a bright new star, Now come, be the first on your block to meet his eye! Make way, here he comes, Ring bells, bang the drums. You're gonna love this guy (The MAJOR mingles amongst different crowd members.) Prince Ali, fabulous he, Ali Ababwa! Genuflect, show some respect Down on one knee (ABU the elephant marches through town, with ALADDIN (ALI) on his back.) Now try your best to stay calm Brush up your Sunday Salaam And come and meet his spectacular coterie. (IAGO is dancing to the music until JAFAR glares at him.  The MAJOR \"wheelbarrows\" six men up onto ABU's trunk.  They stand on each other's shoulders as ALI shakes hands.) Prince Ali, mighty is he, Ali Ababwa! Strong as ten regular men, definitely He faced the galloping hordes A hundred bad guys with swords Who sent those goons to their lords, why Prince Ali! (The pile collapses on ALI, but a GENIE (tm) brand lightning bolt zaps the pile and he ends up holding them all up in an acrobatic wheel formation.  The GENIE turns into an old man, then a child and speaks the last two lines to the crowd.) CHORUS OF MEN:(Carrying the camels) He's got seventy-five golden camels! (In pops a typical parade commentator) HARRY:  Don't they look lovely, June? CHORUS OF WOMEN:    (On a float)  Purple peacocks, he's got fifty-three! (In comes another commentator.) JUNE:   Fabulous, Harry, I love the feathers! GENIE:  (GENIE is off screen, a giant balloon gorilla proceeds down the parade) When it comes to exotic type mammals Has he got a zoo, I'm telling you It's a world class menagerie! (GENIE pops in as a leopard, then a goat, and speaks the last two lines to the two children from earlier.  We cut to a balcony, where three HAREM GIRLS are joined by the HAREM GENIE.) GENIE:",

                    "raw_text": ": (in couterpoint) Prince Ali, Handsome is he, Ali Ababwa There's no question this Ali's alluring That physique, how can I speak Never ordinary, never boring Weak at the knee Everything about the man just plain impresses Well, get on out in that square He's a wonder, he's a whiz, a wonder Adjust your veil and prepare He's about to pull my heart asunder To gawk and grovel and stare at Prince Ali! And I absolutely love the way he dresses! (JASMINE has been watching from the balcony of the palace.  She humphs it off, then leaves.) CHORUS: He's got ninety-five white Persian monkeys! (He's got the monkeys, let's see the monkeys!) And to view them, he charges no fee! (He's generous, so generous) He's got slaves, he's got servants and flunkies! (Proud to work for him) They bow to his whim, love serving him They're just lousy with loyalty to Ali!  Prince Ali! (ALADDIN throws gold coins out to the people, who rush over to collect them.  ABU and the parade march up the steps of the palace and inside.  The SULTAN runs back inside to the door to the throne room, but JAFAR stands in front of the door. Suddenly, it bursts open, with ABU leading the way, and crushing JAFAR and IAGO behind the door.) GENIE:  Prince Ali! Amorous he!  Ali Ababwa Heard your princess was a sight lovely to see! And that,good people, is why He got dolled up and dropped by With sixty elephants, llamas galore With his bears and lions A brass band and more With his forty fakirs, his cooks, his bakers His birds that warble on key Make way for Prince Ali! (More and more fanfare build up until ALADDIN flies off ABU's back on MAGIC CARPET and flies down to the SULTAN.  JAFAR slams the door shut.) SULTAN: (Clapping) Splendid, absolutely marvelous. ALADDIN:    (Takes on a deeper voice.)  Ahem.  Your majesty, I have journeyed from afar to seek your daughter's hand. SULTAN: Prince Ali Ababwa!  Of course.  I'm delighted to meet you.  (He rushes over and shakes ALI's hand.) This is my royal vizier, Jafar.  He's delighted too. JAFAR:  (Extremely dryly) Ecstatic.  I'm afraid, Prince Abooboo-- ALADDIN:    --Ababwa! JAFAR:  Whatever.  You cannot just parade in here uninvited and expect to-- SULTAN: ...by Allah, this is quite a remarkable device. (He tugs at the tassels, and they tug his moustache.)  I don't suppose I might... ALADDIN:    Why certainly, your majesty.  Allow me. (He helps the SULTAN up onto the CARPET, and he plops down. JAFAR pins the CARPET down on the floor with the staff.) JAFAR:  Sire, I must advise against this-- SULTAN: --Oh, button up, Jafar.  Learn to have a little fun. (He kicks away the staff and CARPET and SULTAN fly away.  IAGO, who was standing on the head of the staff, falls down, repeatedly bopping the staff with his beak as he descends.  SULTAN and CARPET fly high into the ceiling, then begin a dive-bomb attack, flying under ABU, scaring him.  The flight continues in the background, while JAFAR and ALI talk in the foreground.) JAFAR:  Just where did you say you were from? ALADDIN:    Oh, much farther than you've traveled, I'm sure. (He smiles.  JAFAR does not.) JAFAR:  Try me.  (IAGO lands on the staff.) SULTAN: Look out, Polly! (They all duck in time as the CARPET whizzes centimetres over their heads.  CARPET returns and the SULTAN chases IAGO around the room.) IAGO:       Hey, watch it. Watch it with the dumb rug! (The CARPET zooms underneath IAGO, who sighs, wipes his brow, and crashes into a pillar.  He crashes to the floor, and his head is circled by miniature SULTANS on CARPETS, saying \"Have a cracker, have a cracker.  The real SULTAN begins his final approach.) SULTAN: Out of the way, I'm coming in to land.  Jafar, watch this!  (He lands.) JAFAR:  Spectacular, your highness. SULTAN: Ooh, lovely.  Yes, I do seem to have a knack for it.  (CARPET walks over to ABU dizzily, then collapses.  ABU catches it.)  This is a very impressive youth. And a prince as well.   (Whispers to JAFAR) If we're lucky, you won't have to marry Jasmine after all. JAFAR:  I don't trust him, sire. SULTAN: Nonsense.  One thing I pride myself on Jafar, I'm an excellent judge of character. IAGO:   Oh, excellent judge, yeah, sure...not!!! (JASMINE walks in quietly.) SULTAN: Jasmine will like this one! ALADDIN:    And I'm pretty sure I'll like Princess Jasmine! JAFAR:  Your highness, no.  I must intercede on Jasmine's behalf.  (JASMINE hears this and gets mad.) This boy is no different than the others.  What makes him think he is worthy of the princess? ALADDIN:    Your majesty, I am Prince Ali Ababwa! (He pricks JAFAR's goatee, which springs out in all directions.)  Just let her meet me.  I will win your daughter! JASMINE:    How dare you!  (They all look at her surprised.) All of you, standing around deciding my future?  I am not a prize to be won!  (She storms out.) SULTAN: Oh, dear.  Don't worry, Prince Ali.  Just give Jasmine time to cool down.  (They exit.) JAFAR:  I think it's time to say good bye to Prince Abooboo. (Diss to JASMINE on her balcony at night.  We tilt down and find ALADDIN and company in the courtyard.) ALADDIN:    What am I going to do?  Jasmine won't even let me talk to her.  I should have known I couldn't pull off this stupid prince wish.  (ABU struggles with his elephant paws to open a banana.  He squishes it, and the banana squirts into his eye.  He then tosses the banana peel into a heaping pile of the same.) GENIE:  (to carpet, playing chess) So move!  (CARPET does, knocking a black piece off the board.)  Hey. That's a good move.  (As Rodney Dangerfield) I can't believe it--I'm losing to a rug. ALADDIN:    Genie, I need help. GENIE:  (as Jack Nicholson) All right, sparky, here's the deal.  You wanna court the little lady, you gotta be a straight shooter, do ya follow me? ALADDIN:    What? GENIE:  (Back to normal, wearing a mortarboard. He points out his words on a blackboard)  Tell her the...TRUTH!!! ALADDIN:    No way!  If Jasmine found out I was really some crummy street rat, she'd laugh at me. (He puts on his turban, which lights up as the GENIE.) GENIE:  A woman appreciates a man who can make her laugh! (ALADDIN pulls the chain turning off the light.",

Okay, I'm gonna go see her.  I gotta be smooth, cool, confident.  How do I look? GENIE:  (Sadly) Like a prince. (ALADDIN flies up to the balcony on CARPET.  JASMINE is on her bed, sighing.  RAJAH is by her side.) ALADDIN:    (From a distance) Princess Jasmine? (RAJAH looks up and growls.) JASMINE:    Who's there? ALADDIN:    It's me--Prince Ali.  Ahem--(Then he jumps to his deep voice) Prince Ali Ababwa. JASMINE:    I do not want to see you. ALADDIN:    No, no, please princess.  Give me a chance. (RAJAH growls and advances on him.) JAFAR:  Just leave me alone. ALADDIN:    Down kitty! (Over the edge of the balcony, CARPET is watching with GENIE below.) GENIE:  How's our beau doing? (CARPET cuts his neck with his finger.) ALADDIN:    Good kitty, take off.  Down kitty. (He takes off his turban to brush RAJAH away.) JASMINE:    (She looks at him thinking she has seen him before.)  Wait, wait.  Do I know you? ALADDIN:    (Quickly replaces his turban) Uh, no, no. JASMINE:    You remind me of someone I met in  the marketplace. ALADDIN:    The marketplace?  (A bee buzzes around his head.) I have servants that go to the marketplace for me. Why I even have servants who go to the marketplace for my servants, so it couldn't have been me you met. JASMINE:    (She looks disappointed.)  No, I guess not. BEE:        (It's the GENIE) Enough about you, Casanova.  Talk about her! She's smart,  fun, the hair, the eyes. Anything--pick a feature! ALADDIN:    Um, Princess Jasmine?  You're very... BEE:        Wonderful, glorious, magnificent, punctual! ALADDIN:    Punctual! JASMINE:    Punctual? BEE:        Sorry. ALADDIN:    Beautiful. BEE:        Nice recovery. JASMINE:    Hmm.  I'm rich too, you know. ALADDIN:    Yeah! JASMINE:    The daughter of a sultan ALADDIN:    I know. JASMINE:    A fine prize for any  prince to marry. ALADDIN:    Uh, right.  Right.  A prince like me. BEE:        (Buzzing in his ear) Warning! Warning! JASMINE:    Right, a prince like you.  And every other stuffed  shirt, swaggering, peacock I've met! BEE:        (Rear end on fire, wearing goggles and crashing) Mayday! Mayday! JASMINE:    Just go jump off a balcony! (She turns and walks away) ALADDIN:    What? BEE:        Stop her! Stop her! Do you want me to sting her? ALADDIN:    (Swats at bee) Buzz off! BEE:        Okay, fine.  But remember--bee yourself! (BEE buzzes into his turban) ALADDIN:    Yeah, right! JASMINE:    What!?! ALADDIN:    Uh, you're right.  You aren't just some prize to be won.  (He looks disappointed.)  You should be free to make your own choice.  (JASMINE and RAJAH look at each other in confusion.)  I'll go now. (He steps up on the ledge and drops off.) JASMINE:    No! ALADDIN:    (Pokes his head up from over the edge) What?  What? JASMINE:    (Now she's amazed) How--how are you doing that? (She looks over the edge and sees the CARPET.) ALADDIN:    It's a magic carpet. JASMINE:    It's lovely.  (CARPET takes JASMINE's hand with a tassel.) ALADDIN:    You, uh, you don't want to go for a ride, do you? We could get out of the palace, see the world. JASMINE:    Is it safe? ALADDIN:    Sure.  Do you trust me? JASMINE:    (She looks at him at the saying of that all- important line) What? ALADDIN:    (Extends his hand the same as before) Do you trust me? JASMINE:    (Gets a sly grin on her face) Yes. (She takes his hand and gets up on CARPET.  It zooms into the sky, knocking them both into sitting positions.  The music of \"A Whole New World\" swells.  JASMINE looks back and sees RAJAH looking up at her questioningly.  She gasps as they fly over the palace wall and into the sky.) ALADDIN:    I can show you the world Shining, shimmering, splendid. Tell me princess, now when did you last Let your heart decide? (CARPET zooms down through the town, stopping slightly to pick a flower.  It gives the flower to ALADDIN, who gives it to JASMINE. She smiles.) I can open your eyes Take you wonder by wonder Over, sideways, and under On a magic carpet ride (CARPET does as ALADDIN sings, then zooms into the clouds.) A whole new world! A new fantastic point of view No one to tell us no Or where to go Or say we're only dreaming (JASMINE looks back and watches Agrabah disappear from sight.  CARPET flies in and out of the clouds.) JASMINE:    A whole new world A dazzling place I never knew But when I'm way up here It's crystal clear That now I'm in a whole new world with you! ALADDIN:    Now I'm in a whole new world with you! (They each catch a small cloud as CARPET continues the flight.  It then circles a pillar of clouds, giving a swirly look to it.) JASMINE:    Unbelievable sights Indescribable feeling Soaring, tumbling, freewheeling Through an endless diamond sky (They join a flock of birds in the sky.  One of them looks terrified and squawks.  CARPET does somersaults and flips, at times putting ALADDIN and JASMINE in free-fall, but catching them.  They then zoom above the clouds where a starry night awaits them.) JASMINE:    A whole new world! ALADDIN:    Don't you dare close your eyes JASMINE:    An hundred thousand things to see ALADDIN:    Hold your breath--it gets better! JASMINE:    I'm like a shooting star, I've come so far I can't go back to where I used to be! (They zoom down over a river, apparently the Nile, for beyond the ship's sails are the Great Pyramids.  They wave at a worker sculpting the complete nose of the Sphinx.  He smiles, but chisels too much and breaks off the front section of the nose.) ALADDIN:    A whole new world! JASMINE:    Every turn a surprise ALADDIN:    With new horizons to pursue JASMINE:    Every moment, red-letter (They fly alongside wild horses running.  JASMINE pets one of them.) BOTH:   I'll chase them anywhere There's time to spare Let me share this whole new world with you A whole new world That's where we'll be (They fly through Greece, where ALADDIN grabs an apple from a tree and rolls it down his arm to JASMINE, who is now sure she is dealing with ALADDIN, not PRINCE ALI.) ALADDIN:    A thrilling chase JASMINE:    A wondrous place BOTH:       For you and me! (CARPET hovers along over a lake, and we see the reflection of the moon in the lake.  Fireworks burst and we see the couple at a Chinese New Year celebration, sitting on a rooftop.) JASMINE:    It's all so magical. ALADDIN:    Yeah. JASMINE:    (She looks at him and decides to burst the bubble) It's a shame Abu had to miss this. ALADDIN:    Nah.  He hates fireworks.  (CARPET looks up realizing what is happening.)  He doesn't really like flying either. (And now ALADDIN realizes it) That is...oh no! JASMINE:    (She pulls off his turban) You are the boy from the market!  I knew it.  Why did you lie to me? ALADDIN:    Jasmine, I'm sorry. JASMINE:    Did you think I was stupid? ALADDIN:    No! JASMINE:    That I wouldn't figure it out? ALADDIN:    No.  I mean, I hoped you wouldn't.  No, that's not what I meant. JASMINE:    Who are you?  Tell me the truth! ALADDIN:    The truth? (He looks at CARPET who wave him on, giving up hope.)  The truth...the truth is...I sometimes dress as a commoner to escape the pressures of palace life.  (CARPET slumps down in defeat.)  But I really am a prince! (The feather on his turban falls down over his eyes.) JASMINE:    Why didn't you just tell me? ALADDIN:    Well, you know, um...royalty going out into the city in disguise, it sounds a little strange, don't you think? JASMINE:    Not that strange. (She flicks up the feather and cuddles with him.  CARPET puts a tassel under his \"chin\" and looks mystified.  Dissolve to ext. of palace balcony, where ALADDIN and JASMINE return.  CARPET forms a set of steps and she descends.  ALADDIN then descends just below the balcony.) JASMINE:    Good night, my handsome prince. ALADDIN:    Sleep well, princess. (They slowly lean forward to kiss, but CARPET bumps him up and they kiss sooner than expected.  She walks away slowly then turns and looks at him. Finally she enters her room through the curtain.) ALADDIN:    Yes!  (He falls back onto the CARPET, who descends to the ground.) For the first time in my life, things are starting to go right. (He looks up at JASMINE's balcony, and four sets of hands grab him.) ALADDIN:    Hey!  What?  (A gag is tied around his mouth. Muffled words) Abu!  Abu!  (We see the elephant hanging from a net tied in a tree.) GUARD:  Hold him! (Shackles are placed on his feet and his hands.  Another GUARD ties CARPET in a knot around a tree.) JAFAR:  I'm afraid you've worn out your welcome, Prince Abooboo.  (Walks away.)  Make sure he's never found. (A GUARD hits him in the head, and he falls unconscious.  Cut to a cliff, where GUARDS laugh as ALADDIN's body drops into the water. He is conscious now, but his feet are tied to a rock.  The rock hits the sea bottom, then the turban lands and the lamp tumbles out.  He sees this and struggles to rub the lamp.  However, he loses consciousness and falls to the floor.  The lamp, unsettled by his movement, rolls down and rubs against his hands. It shakes, and GENIE emerges with a bath brush, rubber duckie, and shower cap) GENIE:  Never fails.  Get in the bath and there's a rub at the lamp.  (Squeaks the duck)  Hello.  (Sees unconscious ALADDIN) Al?  Al!  Kid, snap out of it! You can't cheat on this one!  I can't help you unless you make a wish.  You have to say  \"Genie I want you to save my life.\"  Got it?  Okay.  C'mon Aladdin!!  (He grabs ALADDIN by the shoulders and shakes him.  His head goes up, then falls.)  I'll take that as a yes.  (Head turns into a siren.) Wooga!  Wooga!  (Turns into a submarine.)  Up scope!  (He babbles in something that sounds like German.  On the surface, a giant water spout emerges, and lands on top of the cliff.  ALADDIN reawakes and coughs the water out of his lungs.) Don't you scare me like that! ALADDIN:    Genie, I--uh, I-uh...(He can't think of how to say it, so they just hug each other.)  Thanks, Genie. GENIE:  Oh, Al.  I'm gettin' kind of fond of you, kid.  Not that I want to pick out curtains or anything. (Cut to JASMINE in her room, humming \"A Whole New World\" and brushing her hair.  The SULTAN appears in one of the double doors,hypnotized.) SULTAN: Jasmine! JASMINE:    Oh, father--I just had the most wonderful time. I'm so happy. SULTAN: (Still monotone from the hypnosis) You should be, Jasmine. I have chosen a husband for you. JASMINE:    What? SULTAN: (The other door opens and reveals JAFAR.)  You will wed Jafar. (JASMINE gasps at the sight of him.) JAFAR:  You're speechless, I see.  A fine quality in a wife. JASMINE:    I will never marry you.  (She goes to the SULTAN) Father, I choose Prince Ali! JAFAR:  Prince Ali left! (A quick pan finds ALADDIN standing in the doorway to the balcony.) ALADDIN:    Better check your crystal ball  again, Jafar! JASMINE:    Prince Ali! (JAFAR gasps at the sight of ALADDIN.) IAGO:       How in the he--(back to parrot-ese)--uh, awk! ALADDIN:    Tell them the truth, Jafar!  You tried to have me killed. JAFAR:  What?  (He goes to the SULTAN)  Ridiculous nonsense, your highness.  He is obviously lying. (He brings the staff close to the SULTAN's face.) SULTAN: Obviously...lying. (ALADDIN sees the staff with its glowing eyes.) JASMINE:    Father, what's wrong with you? ALADDIN:    I know! (ALADDIN grabs the staff and smashes it on the floor. JAFAR flinches and the spell is broken for good.) SULTAN: Oh, oh, oh my! ALADDIN:    Your highness, Jafar's been controlling you with this!  (He advances the staff) SULTAN: What?  Jafar?  You, you traitor! (The trio advances on JAFAR.) JAFAR:  Your majesty, all of this can be explained. SULTAN: Guards! Guards! IAGO:       Well, that's it--we're dead, forget about it.  Just dig a grave for both of us.  We're dead. (But JAFAR sees the lamp in ALADDIN's pocket.  He makes a move, but is grabbed by guards.) SULTAN: Arrest Jafar at once. JAFAR:  This is not done yet, boy! (JAFAR pulls a vial from his pocket.  ALADDIN sees this and rushes him, but JAFAR throws the vial to the floor.  A large red cloud appears.  When it is gone, so is JAFAR.) SULTAN: Find him, search everywhere! ALADDIN:    Jasmine, are you all right? JASMINE:    Yes. (They lean in to kiss, but the SULTAN barges between them.) SULTAN: Jafar, my most trusted counselor, plotting against me all this time.  Just horrible.  How will I ever- (He stops in mid sentence and looks at the pair.) Can it be true?  My daughter has finally chosen a suitor? (She nods) Ha ha!  Praise Allah!  You brilliant boy, I could kiss you!   I won't--I'll leave that to my--.  You two will be wed at once! Yes, yes.  And you'll be happy and prosperous, and then my boy, you will be sultan! ALADDIN:    Sultan? SULTAN: Yes, a fine upstanding youth like yourself, a person of your unimpeachable moral character is exactly what this kingdom needs!  (ALADDIN looks concerned at this.) (Cut to int. of JAFAR's chambers.  JAFAR and IAGO enter.) IAGO:       We gotta get outta here!  We gotta get--  I gotta start packing, your highness.  Only essentials. (IAGO starts throwing things out of his cage.",

ALADDIN:    Genie...I can't. GENIE:  Sure you can.  You just go \"Genie, I wish you free.\"  (He grabs ALADDIN's head and uses him as a mock ventriloquist's dummy.  ALADDIN pulls away.) ALADDIN:    I'm serious.  Look, I'm sorry--I really am. But they want to make me sultan--no!, They want to make Prince Ali sultan.  Without you, I'm just Aladdin. GENIE:  Al, you won! ALADDIN:    Because of you!  The only reason anyone thinks I'm anything is because of you.  What if they find out I'm not really a prince?  (Quietly)  What if Jasmine finds out?  I'll lose her.  Genie, I can't keep this up on my own.  I can't wish you free. GENIE:  (Sarcastically) Hey, I understand.  After all, you've lied to everyone else.  Hey, I was beginning to feel left out.  Now, if you'll excuse me, master. (He says the last word in disgust, then poofs back into the lamp.) (ABU and CARPET are watching from the window.) ABU:        Ohhh. ALADDIN:    Genie, I'm really sorry. (A tongue comes out of the spout and raspberries him.)   Well, fine. (He slams a pillow on top of the LAMP.)  Then just stay in there!  (He looks at ABU and CARPET.)  What are you guys looking at? (They both leave.) Look, I--I'm sorry.  Wait, Abu-- wait--I'm sorry, I didn't-- wait, c'mon.  (He sighs.)  What am I doing? Genie's right--I gotta tell Jasmine the truth. JASMINE:    (From a distance)  Ali, oh Ali--will you come here? ALADDIN:    (Putting on his turban) Well, here goes.  (He walks into the garden.)  Jasmine?  Where are you? (We see IAGO wearing a beak and standing on stilts next to a FLAMINGO in the pond.  He is imitating JASMINE's voice.) IAGO:       Ahem--In the menagerie, hurry. ALADDIN:    I'm coming. (We see ALADDIN hurry past, not noticing the birds.  IAGO laughs, then turns back and looks into the face of a FLAMINGO, who is panting.) FLAMINGO:   D'uh! IAGO:       Ya got a problem, pinky?  (He sweeps the bird's feet out from under it. IAGO runs into the palace and finds the lamp under the pillow.)  Boy, Jafar's gonna be happy to see you!  (Stretches his face like JAFAR's and imitates it.)  Good work, Iago! (Normal) Ah, go on.  (JAFAR) No, really--on a scale of one to ten, you are an eleven! (Normal) Ah, Jafar--you're too kind.  I'm embarrassed, I'm blushing.  (He flies away with the lamp.) (Cut to the palace entrance.  The SULTAN is standing on top, making an announcement to the people.) SULTAN: People of Agrabah, My daughter has finally chosen a suitor! (Cut to behind the curtain, where JASMINE is peeking.  ALADDIN appears at the bottom of the stairs.) ALADDIN:    Jasmine? JASMINE:    Ali, where have you been? ALADDIN:    There's something I've got to tell you. JASMINE:    The whole kingdom has turned out for father's announcement! ALADDIN:    No! But Jasmine, listen to me, please! JASMINE:    Good luck!  (She pushes him out onto the platform with the SULTAN, where he overlooks the entire crowd.) SULTAN: ...Ali Ababwa! ALADDIN:    Oh, boy! (Far above, IAGO and JAFAR watch through a window.) IAGO:   Look at them, cheering that little pipsqueak. JAFAR:  Let them cheer. (He lifts the lamp and rubs it.  GENIE comes out.) GENIE:  You know Al, I'm getting (turns and sees JAFAR) reallyyyyyy--I don't think you're him.  (He descends and consults a playbill.)  Tonight, the role of Al will be played by a tall, dark and sinister ugly man. JAFAR:  I am your master now.  (He throws GENIE to the ground and puts his foot on GENIE's face.) GENIE:  I was afraid of that. JAFAR:  Genie, grant me my first wish.  I wish to rule on high, as sultan!!! (Cut to ext where dark clouds circle the castle.  The castle shakes. The roof rips off and the SULTAN and ALADDIN duck.) ALADDIN:    Whoa! SULTAN: Bless my soul.  What is this?  What is going on? (His turban lifts off his head.  When he grabs it, his whole body flies up, then is stripped of all his clothing except his boxer shorts.  The clothing reappears on JAFAR.) JAFAR:  Heh heh heh! SULTAN: Jafar, you vile betrayer. IAGO:       That's Sultan Vile Betrayer to you. ALADDIN:    Oh, yeah?  Well, we'll just see about that!  (Pulls off his own turban, but finds it empty)  The lamp! JAFAR:  Finders-keepers, Abooboo. (They both look up and see a gigantic GENIE lift the palace into the clouds..  ALADDIN whistles and CARPET flies up to greet him. They fly up near the GENIE's head.) ALADDIN:    Genie!  No! GENIE:  Sorry, kid--I got a new master now.  (He places the palace on top of a mountain.) SULTAN: Jafar, I order you to stop! JAFAR:  There's a new order now--my order!  Finally, you will bow to me! (The SULTAN bows, but JASMINE does not.) JAFAR:  We'll never bow to you! IAGO:       Why am I not surprised? JAFAR:  If you will not bow before a sultan, then you will cower before a sorcerer!  (To GENIE)  Genie, my second wish--I wish to be the most powerful sorcerer in the world! (GENIE extends his finger.  ALADDIN tries to stop him, but he cannot, and another GENIE (tm) brand lightning bolt  strikes JAFAR, returning him to his normal look.) IAGO:       Ladies and gentlemen, a warm Agrabah welcome for Sorcerer Jafar! JAFAR:  Now where were we?  Ah, yes--abject humiliation! (He zaps JASMINE and the SULTAN with his staff, and they both bow to him. RAJAH comes running at him. He zaps RAJAH, and the tiger turns into a kitty- cat.)  Down, boy!  Oh, princess--(lifts her chin with his staff)--there's someone I'm dying to introduce you to. ALADDIN:    (off-camera) Jafar!  Get your hands off her! (JAFAR zaps ALADDIN.  CARPET flies away.) JAFAR:  Prince Ali Yes, it is he, But not as you know him. Read my lips and come to grips With reality (JAFAR brings the two of them closer in the air.) Yes, meet a blast from your past Whose lies were too good to last Say hello to your precious Prince Ali! (JAFAR zaps ALI back to ALADDIN.) IAGO:       Or should we say Aladdin? ALADDIN:    Jasmine, I tried to tell you. JAFAR:  So Ali turns out to be merely Aladdin Just a con, need I go on? Take it from me His personality flaws Give me adequate cause To send him packing on a one-way trip So his prospects take a terminal dip His assets frozen, the venue chosen Is the ends of the earth, whoopee!
