He      whips out his pair of imaginary six shooters, spins them on his fingers and     returns them to-their imaginary holsters, making gun sound effects. He's very      happy.-He passes the Security Guard - he draws his gun on him - zero reaction     the Guard just raises his eyebrows and yawns. BEAN heads on through the gallery merrily - but suddenly, his good mood is broken, when he notices 3 schoolgirls entering a new exhibition, called The Ultra-Human Form. This worries him - and we soon see why - BEAN heads in to the room where all the paintings are very graphic nudes, and the 3 girls are having a good giggle. BEAN quickly rushes over and with his hand covers the breasts of the painting they're inspecting. Two girls then move on to the next painting - which unfortunately also has breasts. BEAN stretches and just manages to cover them with his other hand. Now the third girl    heads on, so BEAN can drop the hand on the first painting - but now has to try    to cover the breasts on the third painting, which is a real long stretch away.     He can't quite make it, so he takes off his shoes, which gives him the extra    3 inches. Again, safe. Just. Now, all three girls leave the paintings - but, to BEAN's chagrin, head over to a classical nude sculpture in the middle of the room. It's like the 3 Graces, 3 naked women back to back. BEAN thinks fast. He quickly whips off his 12 Belt and rushes over to the statue, where he succeeds in looping it round to cover all six nipples. Unfortunately the girls have already lost interest and head over to the other side of the gallery. To BEAN's horror. Because at that moment we reveal what is on the other side of the room. A epic painting in the style of the others - with literally 40 graphically naked people. BEAN sprints across the room, stands on a chair, and desperately tries to cover a particularly lurid example of a gentleman's manhood. At which    moment the teacher of the party and 40 other schoolgirls appear and scream in    chorus. BEAN thinks that it is the painting that has caused offence and is in    outraged agreement with them. He turns. Cut wide to reveal that they are    screaming because he's beltless trousers    have fallen down. CUT TO: EXT.   GRIERSON GALLERY.     AMERICA - DAY. 8.30 am California time. A modern building with plenty of glass. Large, modern sculptures are spotted around its grounds, including a dramatic one of two huge old cars, head down in the ground, backs protruding into the air. THOMAS GRIERSON, owner of the gallery, wearing a slick expensive suit, walks with DAVE LEARY and BERNIE, both in casual jackets and ties. GRIERSON is a vain, slightly pedantic and pompous man - maybe short - always just trying to show he's Boss. The three are strolling towards the main entrance.

BEAN enters the plane and turns    right, into the body of the plane. After walking right down the plane, he    is directed by a hostess back up to first. As he walks back, we notice the'    ridiculous contrast, from totally cramped accommodation with hundreds of   children and muzak, to the elegance, and space of First class. BEAN couldn't be more thrilled.    There follows a sequence of short moments from this nightmare flight. 1/ The Old Tea-Drinking Lady is being helped with her ,luggage.    A hostess slides it into the compartment above her head.",

Doesn't quite go - so he pushes     it violently. We hear crunching cracking sounds. Finally, it's almost there     - BEAN slams the locker door. One final definitive, though muffled, smash.      The OLD LADY looks at BEAN suspiciously. 2/ BEAN sits down - and who should be his next door neighbour? The Grand Man, whose name is REYNOLDS. BEAN smiles merrily. The affection is not mutual. Champagne comes    round instantly. BEAN takes it, along with a small bowl of nuts, and clinks    glasses with his unsmiling partner. BEAN tries to impress him by throwing    nuts up into the air and catching them in his mouth (a well practised art).     No response. BEAN then switches on the noisy overhead air blower. Then can't turn it down again. It's very stuck. He manages however to push it away from his face - straight into REYNOLDS' . REYNOLDS looks annoyed, BEAN guiltless.",

REYNOLDS picks up his champagne to have his first proper sip. And whapp! The spitball, under high pressure, shoots into it, sending champagne spraying all over REYNOLDS.     Not a good start. 3/--BEAN is reading the in-flight magazine. There's an annoying sound. He looks sideways - it is the headphones of the YOUNG BOY in the seat across the aisle. He's fallen asleep with his headphones on. BEAN looks annoyed. Then suddenly decides to cut his fingernails with a little pair of scissors he carries. He holds out his hand to snip the nail - and accidentally on purpose simply cuts the wire of the boy's headset. That's better. 4/ Night. Wide shot of the plane - everyone is asleep except one pool of light. It's Mr BEAN still up, reading. But even he is   wilting. His eyes close, and his body starts to waver towards sleep. Next to    him, REYNOLDS is in a total lying position - and unfortunately,   as BEAN slowly tips over, his mouth comes into direct contact with REYNOLDS'   flies. From across the compartment, a hostess sees what's happening. She's shocked, comes over and taps BEAN on the ,,shoulder. He shoots up, and nearly strangles her in shock. She calms him down, shows him how to put his chair back - and leaves him to sleep. CUT ON.... 5/ REYNOLDS still asleep. With BEAN asleep completely on top of him. Completely. His hand is spread on REYNOLDS' face. REYNOLDS' eyes open.         He sees what's happened. His arm goes up and rings for the Hostess. 6/ Morning has broken. REYNOLDS is still trying to sleep - BEAN is wide awake. The Hostess approaches, and the MOTHER of the YOUNG BOY says her son isn't very well. BEAN decides to cheer him up. He mimes an aeroplane which makes the boy feel more ill. Then does a rather good lizard impersonation by sticking bits of paper to his tongue and eye-lids and fluttering them. He then brings out a scrunched up bag of Dolly Mixtures and does his trick of throwing a sweet in the air and catching it in his mouth. The boy is too ill to be impressed. BEAN tries to cheer him up with his imaginary gun pretending to be a cowboy and then a tough American Cop. Nothing. Then he has an extremely fun idea. He empties the Dolly Mixtures from the paper bag and pockets them. 22 He then blows up the empty bag and is about to pop it to wake REYNOLDS, when he sees it's got a hole in it. No fun. Meanwhile, the Boy has taken out his sick-bag. BEAN is delighted - yes, that's perfect. He turns away for a split second to scrunch up the useless bag, while, unseen to him, the boy vomits into his bag. BEAN turns, grabs the bag from him - blows into it, puts it right into REYNOLDS' face at arms length, and smacks his hands together. CUT at just the right moment. CUT TO: INT.   AMERICAN AIRPORT.

A random bunch of people are waiting - relatives, limousine drivers - and, rather strangely, three 30 year old women dressed in curly red wigs from the musical, 'Annie'.

On the table are two, large, shiny, hard backed books, wedged up    at one end and sloping away at right angles to one another. Each book has a     pair of rulers set, parallel to one another, in Play-Doh. They each form     a canal. Between one pair of rulers sits a small box of salt. Between the    other pair is a miniature bust of BEETHOVEN. As the phone continues to ring     and vibrate the table, these items judder along the canal, an inch at    a time. The box of salt teaches the bottom of the book and topples over the edge of the table. ( The BEETHOVEN bust' teeters on the edge of its book). The salt lands in a plastic funnel, taped to the top of a bamboo stick. The bottom of the stick sits on the BBC 2 button of a T.V. remote control. Close-up of its infrared L.E.D. as it flashes once. The phone stops ringing. CUT TO: the T.V. comes on at the start of a documentary about grizzly bears. A voice-over begins a narration. CUT TO: close on TEDDY sitting in his cardboard box hotel.    Flickering light from the T.V. plays on his face. CUT TO: INT.   THE LEARY HOUSE.    KITCHEN - DAY Bean hangs up happily, then approaches the toaster, stuffs a pair of wet socks into it and pulls down the start lever. Satisfied, he now turns to the family.",

He turns towards it at just the moment a man exits from a booth - BEAN turns back to the sink to hide his trousers, as the man swiftly does his hands, goes to the paper dispenser, and takes the last towel.

Another Man enters. Again, BEAN is 1 compromised - pretends it's even more exercises. That man also enters a booth. 4/ BEAN suddenly notices the hand drying machine! He turns it on. A healthy blast of warm air. Annoyingly, it's also rather too high. He tries jumping and bouncing to get his waist to the right height. It's not going to work. Brainwave! He climbs up on two sinks. Now the drier is blowing in exactly the right place. BEAN sways to let the air cover the whole area. It's working excellently. 5/ At which moment, one of the men exits from         a booth and sees him in the mirror. BEAN is in an immensely compromising          sex-with-machine position. He pretends he's there to change the light bulb         above, which he takes out calmly and polishes. The man leaves, BEAN smiles.           But as he exits, BEAN's face transforms - he's totally scalded his fingers         on the scorching bulb. 40 6/ BEAN rushes to the sink, puts his fingers under the tap, pushes on the water - and soaks himself all over again.

He takes a handkerchief from BEAN's pocket, and gets BEAN to guess which hand the hanky's in. It's not in the left. Not in the right. BEAN isn't the slightest bit impressed - he just reaches round and takes the hank-y from where it's tucked into the MIME's trousers - and heads away. As he moves off, the MIME touches h' on the shoulder. BEAN turns and the MIME starts a mocking gun duel. He draws his guns. BEAN is pretty unimpressed. The MIME turns his back and walks the 10 paces to draw. 4 He turns .... But now BEAN decides to settles it once and for all. In a brilliant piece of big mime, he puts together the biggest gun ever seen outside an Arnold Schwarzenegger movie. He sets up a pedestal - opens a case ~ lifts out a hugely heavy gun - then the 7 bits that click on that gun. Then opens another case, and takes out the huge artillery shell to load it. The MIME is getting very frightened. Then BEAN pulls up an imaginary stool to sit behind his mega-Gatling Gun. The MIME begins to run away. BEAN twirls in his imaginary seat, and lines up his sights, following the terrified MIME.",

The ROBBER has to scrabble under a car for them- BEAN thinks of final joke - and niftly swaps the ROBBER's bag, for one of the Old BAG LADY's bags. A few dollar notes spill out of it. When the ROBBER emerges with the keys, BEAN 's waiting to escort him to his car. He opens the door - then spots a tourist hiding and puts his arm around the ROBBER and gets him to take a photograph of them. BEAN removes the ROBBER's mask as the picture is taken. Forgetting himself, the ROBBER smiles for the camera. The ROBBER, jolted back to reality by the sound of approaching Police car sirens, jumps in the car and drives away. BEAN waves goodbye to the convertible as a couple of Police cars screech up. COPS jump out. DAVID approaches the scene with groceries and roses. What kind of hell has BEAN caused now? But instead of trouble, he sees the passers-by are getting to their feet, applauding BEAN and whistling! They crowd round the COPS explaining what a hero BEAN has been. BEAN hands over the gun to a COP. He doesn't really understand what all the fuss is about. He notices the BAG 48 LADY wandering away with her bags. Should he tell her that he has swapped one of them for the ROBBER'S? No. He's getting too much attention to be bothered. A COP comes up to BEAN. It is COP 1 from the airport scene.",

He chooses a can, too rusty to read its label, takes off the lid and sniffs. This smells like the right sort of stuff. He pours the liquid on to a rag and rubs it on the face of Mrs. Whistler. The solvent effortlessly removes the ink stain. Whistler's Mother looks as good as new. BEAN is so, so, relieved. But then he notices something else happening.      The liquid did not stop with removing the stain. It is now busy removing Whistler's Mother's face entirely. As Bean watches-in frozen horror, America's most famous painting turns back to a blank canvas. BEAN thinks for a second - and then has a desperate thought.     Removing the pen that started all the trouble, he decides to try to draw back    on Whistler's Mother's 'face. He doesn't have much time. It shows. Where       once was a sublime oil painting, is now a biro line-drawing which looks    a little like Danny de Vito. Bean lifts it against the wall to check how it's worked.

THE LEARY HOUSE.    BEAN'S ROOM- NIGHT. BEAN is lying, fully dressed, in the darkness, on his back. Thinking. Worried by what he's heard. Then suddenly an idea comes into his eyes.      The music is like his brain He jumps off the bed. There follows a version of the classic tooling up for action sequence. But the 'tools' here are distinctly bizarre. BEAN picks up his suitcase, and in quick cuts, rushes through the house and collects.... DAVID'S PLASTIC KEY CARD A PAIR OF Y-FRONTS A TORCH. SOME OF KEVIN'S CHEWING GUM. 6 EGGS A COOKING BASIN A CUP A LARGE PAINT BRUSH A BOTTLE OF CLEAR NAIL VARNISH DAVID'S LARGE TIN OF LAXATIVE.     A HAIR DRIER AN ACTION MAN DOLL A POSTER OF THE GIRL AND HER BOTTOM WITH THE TENNIS BALL. TWO OVEN GLOVES A SKATEBOARD AND 4 VOLUMES OF THE ENCYCLOPAEDIA BRITANNICA. Fully tooled, he snaps the suitcase shut. CUT TO: 72 EXT.   GALLERY.   NIGHT. The building is floodlit by ground spots. BEAN arrives silently, with suitcase, on the skateboard. Soon his full plan will be revealed. The Gallery is empty, apart from the one Security Guard, BUCK, visible through the glass front of the building, drinking coffee, watching his 12 security monitors. BEAN swallows at the sight of BUCK - he is a massive gorilla of a man. CUT TO: INT.   GRIERSON GALLERY.    RECEPTION - NIGHT. BUCK is casually watching his screens, when suddenly, horror of horror, the huge silhouette of a person hanging .themselves from a tree outside appears, the shadow of the limp body thrown across the floodlit gallery wall. BUCK frantically rushes out. And BEAN subtly slips in. CUT TO: EXT.   GRIERSON GALLERY - NIGHT. BUCK is looking for the body amongst the trees. He finds nothing. Because he fails to notice the tiny ACTION MAN swinging gently in front of one of the ground-level floodlights. CUT TO: INT.   GRIERSON GALLERY - NIGHT'. Inside, BEAN is casually pouring the entire       contents of DAVID's large laxative tin into BUCK's coffee. He also swaps two        keys on the board of keys by the desk. He then takes the opportunity to put        the oven gloves on his feet, one shaped like a pig, one like a crocodile, so       he can move silently. BUCK returns. He sits down, and takes a long gulp of coffee. Pause. BEAN watches. BUCK feels something uncomfortable in his stomach. He takes a key from his rack of keys, and sets off and rounds a corner- On a monitor screen, BEAN watches him break into a canter - as he passes through another monitor BUCK is at full sprint. BEAN giggles. BEAN is satisfied he'll be uninterrupted for a while. He goes to the key- rack, borrows two keys, and sets off on his mission. The next 3 minutes of film are a sequence of cuts between three scenarios: 73 FIRST: BUCK - his next 10    minutes    are not happy ones. When he reaches the toilet, the key he chose    does not    unlock it. He has to sprint back, grab all the keys, and charge back    again to    the door. Then he has to try out every single key. We never see     him find    the right one. SECOND scenario - all the    activities of the night shown on the security monitors. BUCK sprinting     desperately through shot - BEAN casually going about his business and, on one    occasion, BUCK running right past BEAN, but not seeing him - he has other    things on his mind. THIRD scenario - we actually see BEAN's Big Plan. He unlocks the merchandise shop. So he can see properly and have his hands free, he puts the y-fronts on his head, and wedges the torch into them, like a head-lamp. He then takes a poster of Whistler's Mother and replaces it with the rolled-up Tennis Ball Girl. He unrolls the Whistler and places the 4 encyclopaedias on its corners to hold it down. He separates the yokes from the eggs, mixes the whites with clear nail varnish and varnishes the-poster with it. Dries it off with the hair drier. ,With the now stiff poster, he heads up elevators and escalators to get to the Whistler Room itself, all the time chewing gum frantically. Once there, he unlocks the final cupboard with David's plastic key, takes the Whistler down and removes the destroyed Mother from its gilded frame, and its wooden support frame. He uses the chewed gum to stick the new one down to the old frame. He then puts the very convincing forgery back into the security cupboard and relocks it with DAVID's key card. The job is done.     He scrunches up the old, torn picture, pops it in a dustbin, and heads off. CUT TO: EXT. STREET.    NIGHT- BEAN zipping along on the skate board with his suitcase. CUT TO: INT.   GRIERSON GALLERY.      UTILITY ROOM - NIGHT. BUCK, trouserless, is sitting, reading a newspaper next to a noisy washing machine. CUT TO: 74 INT.   THE LEARY HOUSE.      BEAN'S ROOM.    NIGHT.

He sweeps dangerously round a few turns - but just manages to keep the car in tact. Finally he reaches the top floor where there is one quite small space left. BEAN is a good driver in a car that is, unfortunately, one foot wider than the one he's used to. He takes out the comb he always used to measure space with his Mini, and measures the space. Yes. Seems large enough. He moves the car in. It isn't large enough. With a hideous scraping of metal against metal, the Rolls Royce squeezes in between the two cars, losing its wing mirror and door handle in the process. BEAN looks a tadge concerned. CUT TO: INT.
