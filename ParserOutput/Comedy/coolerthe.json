Former Geovassi family underboss from \"back east.\" The guy's a relic from the days before MBAs became the weapon of choice in the \"family\" business. He wears his corporate makeover like a bad coat of paint with traces of Mulberry Street primer showing through. Nicky's accompanied by a pair of CORPORATE TYPES in Hugo Boss threads. Shelly glances their way with a look that suggests he's working himself into a full-on sphincter wind- up. Bad news x2. Shelly's muscle, LOU stands off to one side with an apologetic expression.",

Buddy works the room, leaning in real close to the ladies, delivering the requisite eye contact. When their companions react with mock outrage, Buddy raises his fists playfully in a boxer's defensive stance. It's classic Buddy Stafford schtick. From somewhere across the lounge, an ATTRACTIVE WOMAN jumps up and throws her panties at Buddy. Buddy catches them and waves them in the air... just as another pair whizzes by...

An EXPLOSION OF LIGHT and SMOKE... and JOHNNY CAPPELLA makes his entrance. Decked out in a reflective suit that picks up every light in the house and throws it back at the audience. Johnny's got the style of a Harry Connick Jr. and the moves of Ricki Martin. The energy this guy brings to the stage makes the last twenty years of Buddy Stafford's reign seem like suspended animation. The women in the audience start fanning themselves with delight. It's a new dawn in Paradise. And the panties are coming fast and furious. We see Shelly watching from the back of the room. He shifts his attention to Nicky, Larry and Marty at a primo table. They're having a grand time. Nicky pats Larry on the back of the head. \"Good work, kid.\" Larry turns and raises his drink to Shelly. Shelly stares right through him. A declaration of war.",
