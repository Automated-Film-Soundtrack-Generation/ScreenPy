They sadly shake their heads at the sight, as if they are witnessing a funeral. As we draw closer, we see the center of commotion. It is an ugly sight. Someone had wrecked Charles Jefferson's Blue Scholarship Mustang and welded it to the flagpole. Spray-painted on the side was the message: LINCOLN SURF PUNKS RULE. EXT. RIDGEMONT BLEACHERS - NIGHT The Ridgemont football bleachers are full of cheering students. We see the same basic groups from lunch court, and many more. The cheerleaders are on the field -- Cindy Carr, Dina Phillips and company -- and their cheerleader \"husbands\" sit directly in front of them in the stands. Linda and Stacy sit in the bleachers with some of the Swenson's girls. The Rat and Damone sit several rows above them, watching. The teachers sit together in another section. ANGLE ON BRAD HAMILTON who is again sitting alone in the bleachers. Watching. Several old lunch court friends pass by, on their way to the concession area.",
