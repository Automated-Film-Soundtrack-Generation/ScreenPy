And on the stage steps SANTANICO PANDEMONIUM. This Mexican goddess is beautiful, but not the beauty that Stendhal described in \"As the Promise of Happiness,\" but the beauty of the siren who lures men to their doom. She dances to the raunchy music, not like she owned the stage, but like she owned the world. And if the patrons of the Titty Twister are her world, the world is proud to be her possession. All activity in the bar, save Santanico, stops. Even the Fuller/Gecko table falls under her spell. Especially Richard, Scott and Kate. Seth knows this song and accompanies from the table with the guitar. When the music builds to its explosive section. Santanico LEAPS from the stage, LANDING in the middle of the room. She does an eyes-closed voodoo dance in perfect step with the beat. As the music continues to play, a very fucked-up looking Chet Pussy walks in. He goes over to Razor Charlie and points at Seth's table, describing what happened. As the last verse plays, Santanico, like a snake, comes up from the ground, on top of the Fuller/Gecko table. Richard, Kate and Scott are enraptured. Santanico scans the table, zeroing in on our boy Richard. She STANDS OVER him. While moving her body to the music, she lifts up the whisky bottle from the table, and pours the whiskey down her leg. She lifts up her foot, with the whiskey dripping from her toes, and sticks it in Richard's face.",

Jacob recites the verse from the bible in a threatening, mean, mother fucking, servant of god tone. As he speaks with authority and strength, he sees Frost lying on the ground, bat-things on him like ants on a candy bar. But Jacob is too much in control to let even this repugnant sight trip him up.

Seth and Scott saw the bats into wooden stakes. Kate fills the Uzi squirt guns with tap water from the backroom sink. Jacob, with Seth's knife, etches a cross into every bullet in the .45 automatic's last full clip of ammo. Vampires all start converging on the back room door, getting their courage back. Kate makes water balloons. Scott sharpens the stakes to a point with the tools. Seth attaches a wooden stake to the end of a jackhammer. Jacob blesses the water in the squirt guns and balloons, turning it into holy water. Our heroes work together, preparing for the battle to come. The back room door, barricaded with crates and boxes, begins to be pounded on by the undead on the other side.
