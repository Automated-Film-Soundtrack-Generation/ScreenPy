Alarmed now, Dana hurries after it, but the buggy keeps rolling down the street at ever increasing speed. SIDEWALK Dana chases the buggy down the street, shouting to passing pedestrians for help, but every time someone reaches out to stop it, the buggy swerves and continues unchecked. INTERSECTION Cars, trucks, and buses speed by in both directions as the buggy races toward the corner. DANA She puts her head down and sprints after the buggy like an Olympian. EXT.

EAST 77TH STREET - BABY - DAY Its eyes are wide open with excitement. EXT.

BUS The bus driver reacts in helpless horror as he sees the buggy enter the intersection at high speed. BUGGY It comes to a dead stop right in the middle of the street.  The bus continues missing the buggy by inches. INTERSECTION Cars and trucks swerve and hit their brakes as Dana runs into the intersection and snatches up the baby.  She hugs it close, deeply relieved, then looks at the buggy with the dawning awareness that the supernatural has re-entered her life.",

It's glowing and moving!  It's -- it's a river of slime!! STANTZ He dangles from the end of the cable, holding his feet up as high as he can.  He unhooks a device from his utility belt and pulls the trigger on it, shooting out a long telescoping fishing-pole with a scoop on the end. Reaching down, he scoops up a sample of the slime and starts retracting the pole. SLIME Suddenly, a grotesque arm with a long skeletal fingers reaches up out of the slime and snatches at Stantz's dangling feet.  He jerks his legs up as several more arms poke up out of the slime and reach for him.",
