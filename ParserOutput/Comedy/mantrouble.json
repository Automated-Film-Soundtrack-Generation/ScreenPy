Duke, in a frenzy, leaps at her, then runs toward the glass doors. He hurls himself at the glass, then returns to Socorro. Thinking he's gone rabid, she screams and tries to hide behind one of the weight racks. The above course of procedure continues, with Duke trying desperately to indicate his intentions, chasing Socorro around and over the press benches and exercise paraphernalia. X64C   EXT. ANDY'S HOUSE/GARAGE - NIGHT                           X64C (Helen SCREAMING OVER:) The hooded man has Joan up against the garage wall. One of his hands is on her throat and the other is held over her mouth. In the struggle, she manages to sink her teeth into his hand. He pulls it free and hits her across the face. She reaches to a flower pot on a potting shelf and pole-axes him on the top of the head. It staggers him briefly and enables her to move out of his grasp. She immediately grabs an iron rake from the garden rack and turns fiercely toward him. Now standing, vanquished, breathing hard, and apparently having had enough, he begins to back away from her. When he reaches a safe distance, he turns and moves quickly off, disappearing into the dark. X64D   INT.

He goes through the bureau drawers, the closet shelves, a pair of suitcases, then crosses to one of the two nightstands. Finding nothing in the drawer, he moves around to its mate on the other side of the bed. CLOSE ON HARRY He opens the drawer, glances inside and starts to close it when he sees: POV OF DRAWER A gift envelope with his name on it rests on a small wrapped box. He picks it up, opens the envelope and takes out a plain white card with a handwritten message on it: CLOSE ON CARD \"Thank you for everything you've done for me, Harry, and mostly, for being in my life. I love you, Joan.\" BACK TO SCENE Harry sits down on the bed, feeling the utter deficiency of heart implicit in this act of treachery and deception. He stares blankly into space for a moment. Then he puts the card back, picks up the box and without removing it from the drawer, gives it a little shake. 72A   EXT.
