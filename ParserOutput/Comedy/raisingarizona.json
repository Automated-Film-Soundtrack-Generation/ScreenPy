Hi hurriedly lifts him back out. He looks desperately around the room. The room is wallpapered with nursery rhyme characters. There are toys strewn around. There is one adult-sized easy chair in the corner. Hi carries the baby over to the chair, stepping on and reacting to the squeal of a squeeze-me toy on the way. He sits the baby deep in - the chair and then returns to the crib to deal with the second crying baby. He lifts the baby out of the crib and gently bounces it. This baby stops crying. Another one in the crib starts bawling. Hi sets the second baby down on the floor and gives it a rattle to keep it pacified. He reaches for the third baby in the crib. Sweat stands out on Hi 's brow. He is desperately chucking the third baby under the chin when we hear a muffled PTHUMP! He whirls to look across the darkened room. The first baby has dropped off the easy chair and is energetically crawling away toward a shadowy corner.",

His head is covered with mud, although the driving rain is already starting to wash it away. We are beginning to track in an arc around Gale's head, who is now struggling, working to get his shoulders and arms up out of the mud. The end of the 180-degree arc and a flash of lightning reveal, way in the distance, the wire-topped walls of a penitentiary. Still bellowing, as if in some primal rage, Gale has gotten his muck-covered arms up out of the earth and is now pushing down to haul up the rest of his body. It comes with much effort, and with the loud sucking-popping sounds of the fiercely clinging mud. Finally he is free. With a great cry, the mud-covered man plunges his right arm straight back down into the earth, all the way up to his shoulder. He gropes intently and then, apparently having grabbed hold of something underground, he starts pulling. His arm comes slowly back up out of the mud. Clasped in his hand is - a human foot. Bellowing with effort he continues to pull, liberating the foot... leg... torso of his companion, and finally his head. As the rain starts to wash the mud off his companion's head we see that it is his friend Evelle. Both are bellowing. Mud sucks and pops. Thunder crashes.",

We reach the top and hurtle - THWAP! - through the white curtains of the open second-story window into the nursery to reveal Florence Arizona, her back to us, screaming over the crib. We are rocketing toward her. She is turning to us, hands pressed to her ears, mouth stretched wide in an ear-splitting shriek and we are rushing into an extreme close-up of her gaping mouth and her wildly vibrating epiglottis and we",

We are pulling back to reveal the feet-the shiny black patent leather shoes and blue pants cuffs - becoming quickly spattered - of several policemen milling about the hole. German shepherds sniff around also. With a roar, motorcycle wheels enter frame. The bike's jackbooted rider casually tools around the hole once; police step back and dogs skitter away to give him room. He backs toward the camera and stops, standing astride the bike. The burning stub of a cheroot is dropped into frame; it hisses angrily and dies in the mud. We start to crane up. The whipcracking Biker cue mixes up. The Biker's motorcycle idles with a deep rumble, like the roar of fire on the sun. We are now framed looking over the Biker's shoulder. The policemen's attitude to him seems to be deferential. One cop in front of him is pointing a direction. The Biker is shaking his head; he doesn't think they went that way. Suddenly, with a loud whipcrack effect, the Biker's head snaps to profile. He is staring across the field, stock-still, having heard, smelled or sensed something. The dogs milling around the hole also react, snapping to attention, a split second after the BIKER.",

Hi's knuckles scrape painfully against the plaster of the too - low ceiling. Skin is flayed, plaster crumbles. Hi grabs at his knuckles in pain. Gale lunges with a mid- body tackle that sends Hi crashing into the wall. Gale, still on top of him, reaches back to throw a punch. The reach-back sends his elbow crashing through a window but doesn't stop the punch. It connects with Hi's jaw. Gale throws another quick punch, all his weight behind it. Hi's head bobs sideways just in time and Gale's fist goes through the wall. It is momentarily stuck there. Hi uses the opportunity to grab Gale's one free arm with both of his. He is twisting it to make Gale, roaring with pain, twist around and present his back to him. Hi climbs aboard, grabbing Gale's face. Gale, still roaring, is pulling his fist out of the hole. He grabs a lath exposed by the hole and pulls; it tears out of the wall and snaps free, giving him a length of about two feet. Gale is rampaging around like a grizzly bear hemmed in a too- small space. Hi is hanging on for dear life, his own feet flailing this way and that, knocking over lamps and wall fixtures as Gale bends and twirls about, trying to shake him loose. Gale crashes and bounces off the walls, roaring in pain and fury. Close shots of Gale's face show his features impossibly and grotesquely contorted by Hi's hand, squeezing, gripping and clutching at it. Evelle is dancing around with the baby, dodging crashing furniture and flailing body parts.",
