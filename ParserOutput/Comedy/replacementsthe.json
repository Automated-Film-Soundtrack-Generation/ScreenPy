Bateman dives on two more Bikers, and viciously head-butts one of them. He stuffs the other's head into the meth mixture, pulls him out and clubs him with a big police blackjack, three quick times: Rap! Rap! Rap! The guy goes down like lead. Bateman looks around and spots a big BIKER cowering in a corner. The Biker is terrified. Bateman takes two stops toward the guy when suddenly three more COPS wearing windbreakers run in, out of breath. They look around at the unconscious Bikers.",

B)   SHANE rolls left off the shotgun, fights off a cornerback and throws back across field, complete to Lamont coming out of the backfield. C)   PATRIOT is calling for a fair catch on a punt. He catches the ball but Bateman flies INTO FRAME and decks him. Flags fly. D)   ANDRE AND JAMAL are blocking side by side, pushing their men back as Lamont squeezes through with the ball. E)   EVANS is pass blocking like the all pro that he is. He knocks his man flat and then doubles up on Cochran's man. F)   BATEMAN is pursuing a running back.   He knocks down an official and runs right over him. Then he gets his hands on the running back and pushes him out of bounds and then knocks over a photographer. G)   SHANE pumps once and then drills a twenty yard spiral. Clifford Franklin beats his man and dives for the ball. He bobbles it, and then squeezes it to his stomach as he hits the ground.",

As he turns around from locking his door, he stops dead in his tracks. All of Clifford's neighbors, all the way down both halls, are standing in front of their doors. They all start applauding. Clifford smiles from ear to ear. MONTAGE A)    ANDRE AND JAMAL are trying to hail a cab on Wisconsin Avenue. Suddenly, one cab, then two, then four SLAM on their BRAKES. Cabbies hop out to open their doors for the brothers. B)    ROLAND LAMONT walks down G Street with Brian Murray. Brian spots something in a store window and stops Roland. Roland gasps as he sees himself duplicated on ten TV screens in an appliance store. He's on tape being interviewed at a Redskins' practice. C)    EARL WILKINSON dressed in casual chic, is moving quickly through Lord and Taylor's Department Store    with two sales clerks in tow. He stops,    grabs four cashmere sweaters, smells    them, hands them to one clerk and moves    on. D)    LOU PACIFICO is standing in front of the White House. He has a line of ten people who are paying five bucks for an autographed picture of himself that he hands out from a huge stack. CUT TO: EXT. PALM RESTAURANT - ESTABLISHING - NIGHT We see Shane walk in the door. INT. PALM - NIGHT The Scabskins are all being served dinner in a private room. Mickey Lee is served a steak the size of a briefcase. Andre and Jamal get lobsters big enough to be pets. Ed O'Neil is being fed pureed asparagus by Augustine.

McGINTY Alright, listen up: There have been a lot of rumors about the regular players crossing the picket lines. They are not rumors. Many union players have now seen the error of their ways and are coming back in droves. Apparently, they have been struck with the realization that it is a blessing to be playing professional football. There is dead silence in the room.   Everybody thinks it's over. McGINTY But they had their chance. Now it's your turn. Mister O'Neil and I have agreed to ban all striking players and to continue to go with you guys. There's a beat and then everyone breaks into cheers. Suddenly, the door flies open and a REPORTER and a cameraman step in and start filming. The Reporter shoves a microphone at McGinty.",

They catch him pretty easily at the twenty, but Lee represents a lot of weight. Lee staggers across the ten, shaking players off left and right.

Hi, I'm Al Michaels and we are witnesses to a unique matchup tonight as Shane Falco and a contingent of strike players go up against the entire regular squad of the Dallas Cowboys. Yes, you heard right: every Cowboy has now crossed the picket line, some as late as this afternoon, and they will all play tonight. Can a rag tag group of hasbeens and castoffs stand up to what was once called America's team? And what about the strike itself? It has been so ineffective that many predict it will be over before this game ends. Stay tuned as Boomer and Dan join me for strike ball, D.C. style. EXT. STADIUM - MAGIC HOUR Eddie Martel, Wilson Jones and other regular Redskins take their seats on the fifty yard line. CUT TO: INT. REDSKIN LOCKER ROOM - NIGHT Everyone is just about dressed in their uniforms and ready to go. Lou Pacifico enters in street clothes and starts undressing quickly. He looks worried. Shane watches Lou for a beat. We see Shane shift his upper body and grimace. McGinty enters and pulls Shane aside. McGINTY Congratulations. It's official. You're staying on after the strike. Shane smiles in spite of the pain. McGINTY It's probably better that you not say anything to the rest of the guys until after the game. Okay?",

A defensive back intercepts. Dallas's ball. C)   BALL Boom! The ball goes through the uprights for a Dallas field goal. ON SCOREBOARD Dallas 10, Washington 0. D)   AUGUSTINE massages O'Neil's feet as the old man watches the game. He looks worried. E)   PACIFICO smokes and stalks the sidelines. He looks up into the stands and sees the mafioso type looking down at him. F)   SHANE steps up in the pocket. He looks downfield but in the face of the pass rush, he throws the ball weakly out of bounds. G)   LEE is pass-blocking but the first guy spins him around and the second guy runs right around him. H)   BATEMAN is double-teamed on a pass rush. He spins but he can get no leverage against his opponents. When the play ends, he pushes one of them. A penalty flag flies by. I)   ROLAND LAMONT takes a    pitch out, is immediately hit hard and    loses the ball. A cornerback picks it    up and takes it all the way for a Dallas    score. J)   WILKINSON steps up and bats a ball away from a Dallas receiver. A flag flies. Wilkinson argues the call. K)   COCHRAN is lined up across    from Butler. On the snap, Butler slaps    Cochran in the face mask with his big,    fat club of a hand. Cochran disappears    OUT OF FRAME. L)   DALLAS KICKER Boom!
