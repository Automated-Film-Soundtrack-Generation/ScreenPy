ALLEY - NIGHT Sykes catches sight of the two aliens just as they round the corner at the far end of the alley.  He takes off, quickly cranking up to full speed. EXT.  BACK STREET - NIGHT Sykes rounds the corner.  Doesn't see them anymore.  He slows... moves along this street with some caution.  Lots of shadows, lots of hiding places.  Sykes HEARS a NOISE, looks up... just in time to see Raincoat on a high, huge billboard.  He cuts loose with the shotgun.  Sykes dives. Huge chunks of the crate he dives behind fly off into the night.  Sykes, on his belly, scrambles deeper among the crates. Raincoat's shotgun CLICKS empty now.  He drops it, swings down off the fire escape, runs off. Sykes is up again in a flash, pounding after him. EXT.  TUNNEL STREET - NIGHT Sykes rounds this second corner, races down the street. The only route they could've taken is through a tunnel up ahead.  Sykes approaches the tunnel, all senses wide open. INT.  TUNNEL - NIGHT The murkiness of the tunnel engulfs him as he moves through the mouth.  He tries to control his breathing so he can hear.  The only SOUND is his own shoes scuffing along the asphalt. Then he HEARS -- another set of FOOTSTEPS.  Rapid footsteps, coming toward him, ECHOING.  He can't tell from which direction!  He spins, just as a LARGE SHAPE lunges for him with an alien CRY. It's the wired Raincoat alien.  Sykes gets his gun up just in time and FIRES -- once, twice, three times.  Raincoat alien is knocked backwards to the wet asphalt by the blasts.  Sykes approaches the body slowly.  With an inhuman ROAR, the alien snaps forward, lunging at Sykes with outstretched arms.  Sykes jumps back, startled, and FIRES twice more at the pale figure.  Raincoat goes down and stays down. Sykes relaxes for the briefest moment.  Then he HEARS it... a distinctive CLICKING SOUND, metal on metal.  Sykes looks up and -- Kipling drops down on him from directly above!  Sykes goes down in a heap.  He's managed to hold onto the gun and as Kipling comes for him, he swings the gun hand around.  Kipling sees it, lashes out, slamming the gun from Sykes' hand.  Sykes tries to get to his feet, but the alien grabs him and flings him down the tunnel. A SIREN is HEARD approaching in background. Kipling moves in to deliver the coup de grace.  As he draws near, Sykes HEARS that distinctive CLICKING SOUND again. SYKES' P.O.V. Though his vision is BLURRED, Sykes still gets a good look at an exotic silver bracelet on the alien's wrist.  The strands of this bracelet are what make the CLINKING NOISE. ANGLE The alien rears back, and as he does, the approaching SIREN suddenly WAILS louder as a backup patrol car swings onto the street heading this way.  Kipling sees this and leaves Sykes, running off down the dark tunnel. ON SYKES dazed, struggling to rise.  WE HEAR running FOOTSTEPS approaching.  Sykes turns, his eyes wild and unfocused. SYKES' P.O.V. An OUT-OF-FOCUS ALIEN FACE looming over him. ANGLE Sykes whips around in a roundhouse swing with all his weight on it, pistoning his fist straight into the alien face.

Left-over take-out Chinese food cartons. Left-over take-out burger wrappers. The answering machine message begins -- he glances over his shoulder as he HEARS his daughter's VOICE.

STREET - FRONT OF SYKES' BUILDING - DAWN The slug-mobile parked at the curb.  Silence, then the RUMBLE of a heavy truck... and a tow truck turns onto this street at the corner. The tow truck glides to the curb in front of the slug- mobile.  The driver stays inside as his passenger alights carrying a tool kit and a paper bag.  The human is Quint. Quint uses a slim-jim to open the slug-mobile door, then slides behind the wheel. INT.  SLUG-MOBILE - DAWN Quint slides the contents from the paper bag.  It is a packet of C-4 plastic explosives, with a primer cap, and two lead wires with their ends bared.  Quint bends down, starts to work under the dash.  As his head disappears from FRAME, suddenly another head appears above the seats... George Jetson sitting up groggily in the back seat.  A blanket slips off his head and shoulders.  He sits there blinking, rubbing his eyes, feeling lousy. Under the dash, Quint starts to whistle as he works. Mistake. Jetson, with a puzzled expression, leans forward and sees this guy in the front seat.  Before he can jump-start his brain, Quint sits up, sees him, and hammers him in the face with his fist.  Jetson is knocked back, holding his face.  That was the last thing he needed. EXT.  STREET - FRONT OF SYKES' BUILDING - DAWN Meanwhile Quint is shouting and bailing out of the car. He runs and leaps into the already moving tow truck. It is sliding around the corner out of sight just as Jetson stumbles out of the car.  He whips out his gun from the unfamiliar shoulder rig and it flies out of his hand. Jetson sags against the side of the car, mumbles an alien phrase, clearly the equivalent of \"Fuck it...\".",

We MOVE with him as he walks to the n.d. van (from the beach scene) parked in front of the limousine.  Kipling is just sliding out of the passenger side of the cab.  Quint exits the driver door.  Kipling slides open the van's side panel, reaches in for-- -- a large black suitcase.  He slides it out.  Harcourt nods.  He and Kipling start into the club, followed by Quint. INT.  ENCOUNTERS - NIGHT The club is deserted tonight as Harcourt and entourage move toward the back. EXT.  SECOND FLOOR CORRIDOR - NIGHT Harcourt and the others move up the stairs to the second floor.  Cassandra, wearing a slinky dress, is at the top of the stairs waiting for them.  She's very uncomfortable dealing with Harcourt.  Kipling and Quint continue on toward the office door.  Harcourt pauses with Cassandra. He touches her neckline of her dress, letting his fingers linger against her flesh.",
