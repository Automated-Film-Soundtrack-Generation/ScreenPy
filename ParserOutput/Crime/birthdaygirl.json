Hands stacking bank notes into the back of a cash machine. Fast, mechanical. At the bank, John walks to his desk. His phone rings. He answers it. Silence. Then soft breathing. John listens intently and looks around. \"Nadia...?\" -- John sits there, surrounded by his colleagues, listening to Nadia breathe. Close up on a man's hands tying a tie tight a-round a woman's wrist. Pull back to a close up of Nadia's face, her eyes fixed on John. John running by the river. John watches Nadia rise from his bed after sex and leave the room. He stares out the window. Nadia's fingers, knitting skillfully. Nadia sits on her bed alone, pulling on black stockings and attaching them to suspenders. The street cricketers run for cover as a thunder storm breaks over the close. Rain coming down in John's garden. The pair sit under the shelter of the back porch. John has his hands out as Nadia is winding red wool it into a ball. The jumper is half finished. The rabbits shelter from the rain under broad leaves. John in a pub with a four colleagues from the bank. He sips his half, half listening to the conversation. It all seems so dull. He finishes his drink and looks at his watch. They ask him if he's staying for another. A knitting needle is drawn from a row of red stitches on the nearly-finished jumper. Nadia kneels over John holding the knitting needles. She presses one to his skin and we watch it drawn across his chest in close up, up to his neck. His eyes are fixed on hers. Close up on Nadia's face. Her mouth is gagged and she's lying on her front, head half-buried in a pillow. We can just make out John behind, on top of her. Both are lying still and breathing hard, covered in sweat. Catching her breath Nadia yanks the gag off and wriggles out from underneath him. She snatches up a towel and covering herself hurries to the bathroom. The guitar theme ends.",
