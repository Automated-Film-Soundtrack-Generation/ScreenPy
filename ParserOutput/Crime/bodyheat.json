THE BEACHFRONT - NIGHT The hottest January in fifty years has brought the crowds to the beach in search of relief. But they've been disappointed. Even the breeze off the ocean seems blown from a hair dryer. Still, the nights are a trifle better and the Beachfront, the penny arcades, the ice cream stands and bars are busy, even now in the middle of the week. Racine comes out of a bar and lights a cigarette, idly watching the passing parade. There is a free band concert in progress at the band shell. Racine wanders in that direction. EXT. THE BAND SHELL - NIGHT The Miranda Beach High School Orchestra is playing to a full, sweating house; the audience is a sea of orange programs fluttering away as fans. People come and go frequently. The atmosphere is as innocent and informal as the music the band is playing now. Racine leans against the back rail, smoking, his eyes playing over the scene with no expectations. Then, down near the center aisle, a WOMAN rises. As the band plays on, this extraordinary, beautiful woman, in a simple white dress, moves down the aisle. She moves wonderfully. The dress clings to  her body in the heat. Racine watches, mesmerized, as she walks directly toward him. She passes within a few inches of him, her eyes lowered. Racine's body sways a moment as she goes by, as though buffeted by some force. But they do not touch. She goes out onto the Beachfront walkway. EXT. THE BEACHFRONT WALKWAY - NIGHT The Woman, MATTY, has walked to the rail. She stands there now lighting a cigarette. She presents her face to the ocean, hoping for a breeze.    We move in on her, with Racine. Racine lights a new cigarette and smiles at her. She looks at him and, for an instant, her eyes race over his body, then she looks back at the ocean.

MEN'S ROOM Racine comes in, snaps some paper towels from the rack and turns on the water. The room is full of smoke. A fifteen-year-old Boy is leaning against the wall. After looking Racine over a second, he brings the smoking joint he's been holding behind his back into view and takes a toke. He nods at Racine, who nods back and stands up with his wet towels. As he walks out, Racine takes a deep breath. EXT. THE BEACHFRONT - NIGHT Racine comes out of the structure. And stops. Matty is gone. Racine  looks around without much hope. Finally, he puts a wet paper towel to the back of his neck. We begin to HEAR a strange, measured thumping, and then -- EXT. THE BOARDWALK (82ND STREET) - DAWN Racine is running. The THUMPING is the sound of Racine's battered running shoes hitting the weathered wooden planks of the Boardwalk. Converted to PDF by www.screentalk.org",

The raised wooden walk works its crooked way through lush, tropical vegetation, first coming close to the wide, white beach, then jutting back inland, swallowed by greenery, then shooting out again toward the sea. Racine hits this last stretch at top speed and launches himself flying out onto the gleaming sand. EXT. BEACH - DAWN Racine is running on the sand now, on a raised, hardened section that bisects the beach. His shoes make a weird whooshing SOUND each time they break the compacted surface and sink an inch below. The sun is just rising from the ocean to his right, yet the day is already broiling. Racine's shirt is drenched. The WHOOSHING is hypnotic, steady; his expression indicates that it is just this sound which keeps him going. EXT. THE BAND SHELL/THE BEACH - DAY Further on, Racine runs by the Band Shell where he'd seen Matty. EXT. THE PIER - DAY The THUMPING returns, as Racine runs the long, straight pier directly out to sea, toward the rising sun. A lifeguard boat with an outboard motor is on the left of the pier. Racine watches it as he runs until it disappears beneath him, then reappears on his right and turns out to sea, so that it is running beside him. Racine speeds up, really kicking, racing the boat to the end of the pier. The Lifeguard on board isn't even aware of Racine, but he beats the runner nonetheless, then veers off to continue his business. Racine pulls up, breathing hard. He walks it off a bit, watching the boat, then turns and starts walking back along the pier. He reaches into the waistband of his shorts and takes out a pack of cigarettes. INT. RACINE'S OFFICE - DAY Racine is behind the desk. Occupying the two seats in front are a married couple rapidly approaching divorce. They are arguing now, each trying to convince Racine of their view. Racine nods occasionally, looking from one to the other. But he is also looking between them, through the open door out to the reception room, where his secretary Beverly is kneeling before the lowest drawer of a filing cabinet. Her back is turned and her jeans are tight across the bottom. There's nothing especially provocative about her pose. She's just there. Working away. Converted to PDF by www.screentalk.org",

He shakes it hard, but it's solid. He looks to his left. There are windows down the wall there. He moves to them. They go into the living room but their shutters are closed. He looks through a broken slat at Matty, who watches him from the same spot, through the living room door. Racine tries them. They won't budge. Racine moves to his right past the front door, to the windows off the dining room. He pushes at them as his eyes lock with Matty, who watches from the hall. The windows won't move, Racine spins and picks up the nearest object, a wooden rocking chair. He lifts it, turns and smashes the big window. Glass showers into the dining room. Matty watches.

There are more wind chimes on the    second floor of the verandah, which is off this room, and   Racine is listening to their TINKLING. Racine looks over    in that direction. RACINE'S POV. The moonlit, sheer white curtains on the window roil to a light breeze. Racine's gaze travels over the luxurious bedroom; here too, it is in the Thirties style. Their clothes are haphazardly thrown across a divan and on the floor nearby. A delicate fern sways in the wind. Finally, he is looking at a lovely writing desk against the far wall. Some tissue-thin stationery flaps in the breeze, kept in place by the weight of a pen. Then, as he looks, the paper stops flapping and the chimes gradually STOP TINKLING. Racine looks toward the window. It is still open, but the air had died. Converted to PDF by www.screentalk.org",

It's the same for him. He wipes her cheeks with his hand. CRACK, CRACK-CRACK, CRACK. EXT./INT. WALKER HOUSE (SERIES OF SHOTS) - NIGHT WATERWAY/BOAT HOUSE -- The water laps against the pier. Gently. The quiet sound almost overpowered by the insistent buzz of the night insects. The CAMERA MOVES toward the house. LAGOON/GAZEBO -- A giant palmetto bug leaps from a lily pad into the water, creating a tiny ripple. The CAMERA MOVES toward the house. STAIRWELL/HALLWAY -- Quiet and dark. The CAMERA MOVES along the shiny white posts of the stairs. Upward. INT. MATTY'S BEDROOM - NIGHT Racine and Matty are in bed. Matty is sound asleep, her back close to Racine. But he is not asleep. He is propped up, looking down at her. We've never seen his face like this before. Never this open, never so much in repose. She stirs, and then is still again. He touches her hair lightly. She sleeps. INT. STELLA'S COFFEE SHOP - DAY Same courthouse/cop crowd as before. Racine finishes a sandwich at a table as Lowenstein sits down with two tall glasses of iced coffee, both of which he drinks down. Converted to PDF by www.screentalk.org",

He lights a flashlight   and makes a notation in a small  notepad. INT. \"THE BREAKERS\" - NIGHT Racine's footsteps creak through the blackness.

In his office, Racine hangs up, disgruntled. His feet up on his desk, he has been toying with the fedora Matty gave him. Now he sails it across the office at the hook of a coatstand. It hits and bounces off onto the floor. Racine gets up, walks over and picks it up. He walks away from the coatstand, then turns and floats the hat through the air to land on the hook. From his new position, he can see out into the reception area. Beverly is working at her desk. Racine watches her small movements. Beverly looks up and sees him. G. Evening. Heather is happily watching television in the enclosed side verandah in the Walker house. Matty is in a big chair. She watches Heather, not the television. She puts a cigarette in her mouth then reaches out to strike a wooden match against the rough surface of the porcelain match holder. As it bursts into flame, it becomes -- H. The flame at the end of Racine's match. He is drinking alone at a bar and now lights another cigarette. EXT. FRONT TERRACE - WALKER HOUSE - NIGHT Matty comes out. She's wearing a light, simple shift. She walks over to a small table and begins putting some dirty dishes and glasses on a small tray. Suddenly, Racine takes her into his arms from behind. She GASPS in terror; he turns her to him. He is wearing only cut-off blue jean shorts and his body is wet, glistening. His hair is soaking, slicked straight back. He looks different. She sees who it is and kisses him deeply. They whisper -- MATTY My God, you scared me. You shouldn't be here. Heather's still here. She's upstairs.",

As he bends to unlock   the Stingray, he looks around and a passing car catches his   attention. RACINE'S POV, PANNING with the car as it drives by him. There is only one thing extraordinary about this particular car. The driver, hunched and intent on the road ahead, is a Clown, in full costume and makeup. Racine watches as the car disappears.

Edmund reacts instinctively, raising his arm, the arm that holds the gun, to protect himself. The wooden plank smashes down -- half its force taken by Edmund's forearm, half by his head. The gun BLASTS once. One small window in the front door shatters and the bullet continues into the night. Edmund's revolver slides across the hall floor into a corner. Edmund is on the floor, blood pouring from his scalp. But he is coming on like a crazed beast. His glasses askew, but still on his head, he has grasped Racine around the legs. With a powerful lunge, he pulls Racine's legs out. Racine crashes to the hall floor, losing the wooden plank. Matty, frozen at the stair railing, cries out. Edmund is pulling Racine toward him with all his might, crawling up Racine's body as they both slide on the wood floor. Edmund reaches out one huge hand, and pulls Racine even closer. Racine puts his left hand into Edmund's face, his thumb flat against the lens of Edmund's glasses and pushes his head back. The glasses fly away and Racine loses his hold. Edmund comes on. Racine's right hand gropes -- gropes -- finds the wooden plank. He swings it up. The wooden plank describes a perfect arc into our view, and then out, finding its mark with a HORRIBLE THUD. Matty, up the stairs, turns away. Racine falls back on the floor. Converted to PDF by www.screentalk.org",

Suddenly, a police  SIREN pierces the night, followed by the appearance of a flashing red light on the street behind the Cadillac. INT. CADILLAC - NIGHT Racine's eyes jump to the rear view mirror and the flashing red light growing in it. Racine pulls over. The police car slows as it reaches the Cadillac, pulls alongside, and then speeds on ahead, SIREN squealing. A light goes on in the house in front of which Racine has stopped. He pulls away. EXT. FOUR-LANE INTERSTATE - NIGHT The Cadillac pulls up to the interstate from the side street. Converted to PDF by www.screentalk.org",

The lights  penetrate the FOG at orderly intervals, barely illuminating the bridge. A huge FOG HORN fills the air from not far way. EXT. \"THE BREAKERS\" - DELIVERY DRIVEWAY - NIGHT The deserted hotel looms ghostly in the FOG. The Cadillac, lights out, rolls silently to a stop in the half-hidden delivery driveway. INT. \"THE BREAKERS\" - SUPPLY AREA - NIGHT Racine, carrying only a flashlight, has made his way to the supply area he visited before. His beam probes dark corners, responds to random CREAKING. Satisfied that he is alone, he moves a wooden crate and reaches into the hole in the wall which it hid. He brings out Teddy's incendiary device and places it on the floor in the middle of the room. EXT. \"THE BREAKERS\" - DELIVERY DRIVEWAY - NIGHT Racine grunts under the weight of Edmund's corpse, flung over his back. He stumbles back toward the hulking hotel. The trunk of the Cadillac is closed. INT. \"THE BREAKERS\" - CORRIDOR - SUPPLY AREA - NIGHT Racine sits down hard. He is streaming with sweat under the enormous dead weight. He adjusts the plastic sheet so that Edmund's bloody skull won't contact the wall. Racine gathers his strength and half-lifts, half-drags the body down the corridor, his silhouette that of a twisted, double-headed monster. His flashlight glows from ahead at his destination. IN THE SUPPLY AREA, Racine has dropped Edmund's body over some tipped shelves. Now he lifts the  heavy ceiling beam he spotted earlier. He has to change  its angle only two feet in order to let it drop -- now -- on Edmund's head. Racine walks over to the incendiary device. He pulls out the lever and straightens up. As he does he looks down a connecting hallway. He sees movement. He snatches up the flashlight and the wooden plank and rushes down that hallway. AT THE END OF THE HALLWAY, Racine slides to a halt, breathing hard. Again he sees the movement. A horrible, sweaty figure confronts him -- there is a broken mirror attached to the wall. Racine looks at himself a long moment and the tension seems to drain away... Someone speaks in the shadows! Converted to PDF by www.screentalk.org",

END OF THE PIER - NIGHT Lowenstein is there, all alone, silhouetted in the moonlight. He uses the rail like a ballet bar, returning to it each time he finishes a small combination of dance steps. The moves are not extravagant, there is not highkicking. Just a nice, smooth little combination that Lowenstein is repeating, again and again. He HUMS his own accompaniment. Then, softly at first, from the distance, comes the THUMPING of running shoes on old wood. It grows as Lowenstein completes another repetition. When the THUMPING has gotten close, it slows, then stops raggedly. Lowenstein looks that way.",

Racine peers inside one final time. He is looking through the new glass in the same little window shot out by Edmund's gun. The wind chimes TINKLE loudly. EXT. INTERSTATE 95 - DAY Racine's Stingray whips south in the morning light. INT. RACINE'S CAR - DAY Racine is shaved and showered and wearing a tie, but he doesn't look fresh. His mind is elsewhere. He looks off to his left. Miami sits on the horizon. INT. ELEVATOR - SKYSCRAPER - DAY The elevator is packed with lawyers. They're heading out to lunch. They wear expensive suits. Racine is backed into a corner. He watches them, as though from a distance. He looks different from them. INT. LOBBY - SKYSCRAPER - DAY The lawyers pile out of the elevator. A few carry briefcases. Racine finally appears. He too carries a briefcase. He looks across the huge lobby at the entrance to a restaurant/bar. INT. RESTAURANT/BAR - SKYSCRAPER - DAY Racine sits at the bar with a drink. Once more, he glances diagonally to the end of the bar, at a guy in a three- piece suit. The guy seems to be looking at Racine whenever he isn't watching the front entrance. Finally the guy can control himself no longer. He picks up his drink and walks around the bar to the space next to Racine. His name is MICHAEL GLENN and he's bright, successful and irritating. The two men are on the edge of remembering each other.",

GAZEBO -- WALKER HOUSE - NIGHT Close on Racine's watch -- ten-o-five. The wind chimes on the gazebo TINKLE. Racine sits smoking in the shadows. He takes another drink from a glass of liquor. All the lights on the lawn, gazebo and boathouse are off. Racine hears something and peers toward the driveway. Headlights move very slowly up the drive toward the house. It is Edmund's Cadillac, glowing in the moonlight. The Cadillac stops in front of the house and for several moments nothing happens. Then Matty gets out of the car Waterway. She is wearing the same white dress she was wearing when Racine first saw her and she is luminous in the moonlight. Racine watches from the blackness of the gazebo. Silently. Matty walks twenty feet past the gazebo and stops when she can make out the boathouse in the gloom. She stares at it a moment then turns back toward the house. Racine steps to the edge of the gazebo. Matty seems startled for only a split second.",

Grace pulls his own gun from a shoulder holster and raises it. He is about to call out, when Matty disappears completely in the gloom. Racine lowers the revolver wearily and stares out toward the boathouse. Grace lowers his gun and looks out there too. He moves slowly forward. Close on Racine's face. It's changing now. It's not just that he's very tired. The hardness is going out of his look. As the seconds tick by, and Matty does not reappear, he begins to lose faith in his view of the world. He begins to be afraid. Afraid for Matty. Even now. A sudden breeze starts the wind chimes TINKLING loudly.",
