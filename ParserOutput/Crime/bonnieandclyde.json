She's far off in the cornfield, stalking off, looking neither to right nor left, carrying a brown paper sack that has split, from which she has occasionally lost clothing.  CLYDE screams, \"BONNIE.\" She apparently doesn't hear. Angle on cornfield.  Day.  As CLYDE gets closer.  BONNIE herself suddenly breaks into flight, the paper bag splitting completely, the remaining clothes spilling out.  There is a real chase where they each try to get the advantage.  CLYDE is so exhausted from his run that he has real trouble cornering her as they maneuver up and down the rows of corn. Finally CLYDE catches up. Extreme close-up.  BONNIE & CLYDE.  Day.  As they tumble into the stalks of corn, mowing them down.",

Inside the armored truck.  Two men in the seat.  Sounds of gunshots coming from everywhere, piercing light.  From inside the truck, we suddenly see the windshield shattered from bullets fired by BONNIE and C.W.  The driver is hit, and he slumps over the wheel.  His body hits the horn, which starts blasting and continues throughout the battle.  The other man, quickly, ducks under the dashboard for protection. Inside the garage.  CLYDE standing by the car.

Camera pans across the motel to the other door.  It opens, BUCK and BLANCHE come out, holding a double bed mattress in front of them for protection.  This makes their running awkward--the mattress is heavy.  BLANCHE carries the front end, BUCK the back with one hand, the other firing his gun. They get halfway to the car and then BUCK is hit, shot in the head.  He falls to the ground; BLANCHE and the mattress fall too since she has lost balance.  Both are under the mattress. CLYDE dashes out of the car and drags BUCK into the back seat.  BLANCHE follows, hysterical.  All guns on all sides are still firing.  They fling themselves into the car and from a standing start, the car starts out at 60 mph down the driveway.  One of the lawmen stands blocking the way with a double-barrele rifle, but the car keeps coming, about to run him down.  He jumps out of the way and fires at the side. The glass cracks and we see BLANCHE fling a hand to her face, which is bloody.  A piece of glass has lodged in her eye.  We hear her scream.  The horn is still blasting. INT. THE CAR SWERVING MADLY.

BONNIE is yelling at everybody to shut up. 94. Only CLYDE, driving with both hands clenched on the wheel, is silent.  The car is doing 90. EXT. SUBURBAN STREET.  NIGHT. The car from the outside, a half hour later.  They have eluded the police.  They are barreling down the road at top speed on a nice suburban street with proper homes.  It is the middle of the night, utter silence.  CLYDE stops the car, points to ca car in a driveway--it is a beautiful, shiny new and expensive automobile.  C.W. runs out, runs up the driveway, peers inside, gets in, quietly backs it down the driveway and pulls behind the gang's bullet-riddled getaway car.  Suddenly they both zoom off down the road together. INT. OF THE NEW CAR.  NIGHT. C.W. driving alone.  He is crying, mumbling, wiping his eyes and nose with one hand while he controls the wheel with the other. EXT. RING OF FIRS.  NIGHT. A wide field in the country.  This is Dexter, Iowa.  It is quiet.  We see, in a long shot that takes in everything, that this is a meadow surrounded by a ring of trees, a dense forest that circles them.  The meadow, however, is large. The two cars drive into the middle of the field, headlights on.  They stop and the Barrow gang gets out.  They are in horrible shape--we can finally have a look at them.  Half- dressed in their pajamas, bloody, dirty, in tatters.  Those that can stagger out do so, others are carried.  A far shot of all this. Closer shot.  Moving closer to them, we see CLYDE and C.W. lay BUCK down on the ground.  CLYDE begins to administer to his wounds as best he can, mostly just wiping him off.  BUCK is semi-conscious.  All are in a semi-daze.  BLANCHE falls to her knees, still clutching her eyes.  She is totally hysterical.",

The odds are; CLYDE on a uke, b.g., BUCK, and BLANCHE--gathered around C.W. who sits in the only stuffed chair in the room.  Their o.s. raucousness is clearly shattering to BONNIE who, at a key moment in the scene, ends up spearing her cuticle with a file, spurting a little board and a lot of temper. Other angle.  CLYDE--BUCK--BLANCHE--C.W.  Day.  A naked lightbulb (the lampshade has been removed) glares down on C.W.'s chest--where a pair of bluebirds have been tattooed with a rocco flourish.

The thought strikes the audience at the same time it strikes the gang--they must get to that car. Med. shot of the second car, sitting in the field, shining in the sun.  The lawmen also realize what must be done--cut off this escape.  Though BONNIE, CLYDE and the others are heading toward it, they suddenly train all their fire on the car rather than the gang. The car fills the frame of the screen.  Bullets begin to hit it.  It starts to quiver under the impact.  For the next minute, we see the car die in front of our eyes.  We see the beautiful machine fall to pieces--windows smash, tires torn apart, body riddled.  The death of the car is as painful to watch as the willful death of a human being.  The execution is paced deliberately to show the ritualistic tempo of the destruction. EXT. WOODS. The camera pulls back, way back and slightly above everything to reveal the entire field.  On the left of the screen, BONNIE, CLYDE and C.W. are scrambling toward the edge of the woods.  In the center BUCK and BLANCHE have taken cover behind a fallen log.  In the foreground, police begin to emerge from the woods.  The camera zooms rapidly in with them toward BUCK.  BLANCHE is screaming.",

The gun fight takes just seconds during which law fires eight-seven shots at BONNIE and CLYDE, giving them absolutely no chance.  The sound is rapid, deafening. At no point in the gun fight do we see BONNIE and CLYDE in motion.  We see, instead, two still photographs cut into the sequence: one of Clyde, half out of the car, taking careful dead aim with his gun, just as he did in the teaching scene: one of BONNIE, in terror, a pack of cigarettes in her hand clutched tight, looking as fragile and beautiful as she can be. The noise stops at once.  Utter silence.  It has been a massacre.  BONNIE and CLYDE never had a chance to return the gunfire.  We see the car, a complete shambles.  We never see BONNIE and CLYDE dead, though for a moment we discern their bodies slumped in the car. The camera pulls above the car until it is on a level with the opposite side of the road.  Then, slowly, the six lawmen stand up in the trench.  On the faces of the five deputies, horror and shock at what they have just done.  HAMER, however, registers no emotion.  His face is a blank.  He lights a cigarette.  Slowly, slowly, the five men begin to edge closer to the car to see the result.  Music, the wild country breakdown music, begins on the sound track.",

BONNIE is in the back seat, her legs wrapped in a plaid blanket, writing poetry.  She looks like Elizabeth Barrett Browning.  With one essential difference--her arm is in a sling and she is wearing bandages on the shoulder.  CLYDE is in the front seat, reading a newspaper.  He is also partially bandaged.  On the dashboard is a box of ginger-snaps which he eats while he reads.  They look domestic.",
