For these men, ten minutes relief is worth far more than the life of another human being.  Torture, the pain they inflict, the screams of the victim, are all part of the ritual that gives them a brief respite from their own psychic pain.  And then the depression, the forgetting, the feeling of sadness and despair begins the cycle all over again.

It's like the murderer walked off the edge of the earth.  And you never know.  But you keep asking yourself -- when you read about a new murder -- is he back? M.J. stands.  She has noted Ruben's reaction to Helen's story.  There is an edge of sarcasm in her voice... M.J. That's amazing.  A whole new book, thought up in a minute.  Very good.
