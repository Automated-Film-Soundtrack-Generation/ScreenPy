Blomkvist scrolls through the Courier negatives he has converted into positives and has loaded into Photoshop. He was right. Many more parade pictures were shot that day. Several at street level - a marching band, floats, children with balloons, some in better focus than others. He reaches the first of the higher-angle shots from the floor above the haberdashery, scans the crowd lining the street. Harriet isn't in it. But in the next she appears at the edge of the frame with her school friends. In the next, she's further into frame. And the next, standing in the same spot he stood earlier today. 124   OMIT - INT.

The first few, accompanied by the default music, Minuet in G, dissolve at two-second intervals. Too long. Too distracting with the music. And too wide. He adjusts the size function - closer on Harriet gets rid of the dissolve effect and music and reduces the time- interval to make the transitions as quick as possible. He hits `play' again and watches a short jerky `silent film'- a kind of electronic flip-book: Harriet arrives with her friends. Moves along the street. Stops and faces the parade. Says something to her friends. Laughs. Watches the float with the harem girls on it. Smiles. Sees something to her left. Turns her head slightly toward it. Her eyes widen in fear. She looks down. She moves off. Her friends look after her confused. And then she's gone. Blomkvist backs up to the frame of Harriet looking off with fear in her eyes, and for the first time believes without a doubt what Vanger has believed for 40 years: She was murdered. Whoever she saw across the street followed her and killed her. The cat watches him. 126   INT. BJURMAN'S APARTMENT - NIGHT                         126 Bjurman slowly comes to.",

Sticks of furniture. Old water-stained books strewn around. Beer bottles and other debris left by intrepid Hedestad teenagers. It's creepy, even if you weren't alone in it, knowing what you know. He kneels to look at some of the books. Mickey Spillane, a bird guidebook, something called The Evil Empire about the USSR, a children's book.

A piece of the stone wall next to his head suddenly erupts. As fragments tear into his scalp, he hears the delayed crack and echo of the rifle shot - He throws himself to the ground. Crawls desperately around and behind the ruins. Sees his shirt is bloody but can't feel a wound under it. Touches his face and finds the blood is coming from his forehead. He can see no one, and is almost relieved since if he could it would mean they were walking toward him, which would mean he would soon be shot dead, point blank. He has to get out of here before that happens. Behind him - the rocky cliff he just climbed. Ahead of him - a clearing leading to woods. Really only one choice - He runs for the trees.

But all that really interests Salander is the date. The article was published one day after the paper printed the story of the discovery of Rakel's battered naked body. Salander flips through the handwritten notes she made during her talk with the retired detective in Landskrona - and finds that part-time palm reader Rakel's main job was as a cleaning woman for Carlen Construction. The detective interviewed her co-workers, but no one from Vanger Industries, including that firm's representative in town for a few days, Gottfried Vanger. Gottfried Vanger ... which one was he again? Salander brings up on her laptop photographs she took of the wall of the cottage: the Vanger family tree. Gottfried Vanger, Son of Margareta & Richard the Nazi Husband of crazy Isabella, Father of Martin and Harriet Of all the Vangers - at least back in 1950 when Harriet was born - Gottfried was the most handsome. Clark Gable good looks. She puts a check next to Rakel's name and returns to Mari Holmberg and the 1954 Vanger files. 210   INT. COTTAGE - EVENING                                     210 Blomkvist flips through one of Morell's reports stating everyone's whereabouts on the day Harriet's disappeared. INSERT: Across from Martin Vanger's name it reads: \"Arrived on 4:30 train.\" He brings up the Photoshop-enhanced Brannlund parade photo on his laptop - INSERT: The figure with the blazer and pocket patch standing near the watch repair clock, which reads: 2:00. And the photo Harald let him take with him of `Gottfried's useless boy' - INSERT: Young Martin with the search party, the emblem clearly visible on his blazer pccket. He shuffles through copies of articles in Salander's victims' files. Looks at the last one, Lena Andersson, 1967. The photo is a school wallet photo - 117. 117. INSERT: She's wearing a sweater with the same Uppsala Prep School lion emblem as Martin. He looks at Mildred's parade photo of the figure standing near the watch repair clock. It reads, 2:00. And the photo Harald let him take with him of `Gottfried's useless boy' with the search party. In it and the parade photo, he's wearing the same blazer. He shuffles through copies of articles in Salander's victims' files. Looks at the last one, Lena Andersson, 1967. The photo is a school wallet photo - in a sweater with the same Uppsala Prep School lion emblem as Martin. 211   INT. VANGER ARCHIVES - EVENING                             211 Knowing what she's looking for now, Salander finds it fairly quickly: A clipping about a timber company Vanger Industries bought in Kalmar and an interview in its local paper with Gottfried, two days after Mari's murder. She jumps to 1960 - Magda Lovisa Sjoberg - Karlstad - and an article in its local paper - this time with a photo of Gottfried - about a union dispute at its factory there. 212   EXT. COTTAGE - EVENING                                     212 Blomkvist comes out with his cell phone, tries to make a bar or two materialize on it. Dials but only gets a beep that asks him if he wants to `retry.' He doesn't. Instead, under the darkening sky, he looks off to the point. Martin's house is small in the distance, but he can see there's no car in the driveway and no lights on. He stares at it for a long time ... 213   INT. VANGER ARCHIVES - EVENING                             213 Salander pulls a 1962 Uddevalla paper from the files. Same day this time, the same page of the newspaper: Lea Persson's horrific murder and an story quoting Gottfried about an expansion project to the town's harbor. She regards Gottfried's newsprint photo: His face looks more than 8 years older than the one in Kalmar but that's what drinking to excess, and murder perhaps, does to you. 214   INT. COTTAGE - EVENING                                     214 Blomkvist lays the Lena Andersson article - and the photograph of the figure at the parade - atop the rest of the junk on the desk - and quickly scrolls through photos on his laptop, leaving on the screen for Salander to see when she returns: Martin's recent Vanger Industries PR portrait ... 118. 118. 215   INT. ARCHIVES - NIGHT                                     215 Salander has hit a snag. Gets up. We stay to have a look at the problem she leaves: the victims list - now with \"Gottfried\" jotted down next to all but one name: 1967 - Lena Andersson - Uppsala Next to it, the newspaper article about the murdered girl, with a school photo. And, next to that, the reason there's no \"Gottfried\" notation: his obituary in a Hedestad Courier clipping: 1965. We listen to the fading echo of Salander's footsteps - 216   INT. ARCHIVES - SAME TIME - NIGHT                         216 As annoying as the older woman was, it was less creepy with her around. Salander is alone in the old building now, wandering through it looking for vending machines. She finds some. Drops coins in one. A cup fills with coffee. She gets a candy bar from another. The coffee machine finishes. The place again plunges into silence. She starts back with her snack down a hallway - 217   EXT. HEDEBY ISLAND - NIGHT                                217 Trying to look like he's just out for a stroll, Blomkvist walks past Martin's dark house, then turns around, walks up the front path to the porch and makes a show of knocking on the door, just in case anyone on the island can see him, which is doubtful in this darkness. He tries the door. Locked. Comes down off the porch as if leaving, but then veers off the path and walks around to the side of the house. He peers through a floor-to-ceiling window, but can't see much inside. Comes around to the back and looks in another window. Tries the back door. Unlocked. 218   INT. MARTIN'S HOUSE - CONTINUOUS                          218 He can't see a lot in the dark, but doesn't dare switch on any lights. He crosses through the kitchen, but we stay behind to regard a closed basement door ... We pick him up again as he comes into the living room, follow him to a wall of glass. It's pitch black outside. We follow him down a hallway - but stop at a bedroom doorway as if this is as far as we care to go. We stay at the threshold and watch him go in and look around. As he begins rummaging around the recesses of a closet - 119. 119. 218A   EXT. THE BRIDGE - NIGHT                                 218A A pair of headlights comes across the bridge. 218B   INT. MARTIN'S HOUSE - NIGHT                             218B Blomkvist comes back to the wall of glass. Still no lights out there. Heads off to the hall again. 218C   EXT. HEDEBY ISLAND - NIGHT                              218C The car parks fifty yards from Blomkvist's cottage.   The headlights blink off. Someone climbs out. 218D   INT. MARTIN'S HOUSE - NIGHT                             218D Blomkvist comes into a study. Lots of books and framed photographs. He begins looking around. 218E   EXT. HEDEBY ISLAND - NIGHT                              218E The headlights come up the road leading to the point. 218F   INT. MARTIN'S HOUSE - NIGHT                             218F Blomkvist approaches a gun case in the study. Hunting rifles. Three of them - and an empty space for a fourth one. The trees outside the study window flare with light. A moment later, Blomkvist hears a sound of tires on gravel. Martin is back, and Blomkvist is in his house. We rush back down the hall with Blomkvist. Hopefully Martin will enter through the front door because we're going to try to get out the back one - Blomkvist trips over something in the dark and we go down with him. Then up again - through the kitchen - past the basement door - grabs a knife from a drawer - shoves it in a back pocket - hurries out the rear door - 219    EXT. MARTIN'S HOUSE - CONTINUOUS                         219 Blomkvist tries to steady his breathing as he slinks around the side of the house. As he passes a window, it lights up - and we again hit the ground with him. He hurries across the yard, trips over something in the dark - a sprinkler? - and goes down again into wet muck. He gets up and starts down the road as if returning from a leisurely evening walk - which would be more convincing without the limp - not daring to look back as he goes. 120. 120.",

It's stupid, but she's writing under the pre-printed \"Merry Christmas\" inside, a personal note that's more sincere than she thought herself capable. She blows on the ink, puts the card in its envelope, neatly writes \"Mikael\" on it, gets up - 298   EXT. STOCKHOLM - EVENING                                   298 Snow's falling, but unlike the brutal winter storms last year, it's just heavy enough to dust the city in white powder that reflects the Christmas lights in the trees. The beauty of her city pleases Salander as she rides through it on her motorcycle. Or maybe it's something she's feeling as she turns onto Blomkvist's street. She parks. Gathers the garment bag and card, walks under construction scaffolding toward his apartment building. From around the corner ahead, Blomkvist and Erika appear. He says something and she laughs, puts her arm around his waist and lays her head against his neck scarf. Salander stops mid-stride, ducks into an alcove under the scaffolding, waits as long as it should take them to get inside the building, then peers out again - They're not inside. They've stopped just outside the building's entrance. They're embracing. And the longer they stand there together, the sharper the pain stabs at Salander. Finally they separate, but only to allow Blomkvist to unlock the door. Erika takes his hand then, and they disappear inside.",
