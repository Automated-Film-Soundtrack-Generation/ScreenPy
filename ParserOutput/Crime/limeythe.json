Glances at a street sign as he goes by.  Picks up the map book on the seat beside him to check his route. EXT. BOULEVARD.  DAY. Wilson makes a sudden lane change to avoid getting fed in the wrong direction.  Gets HONKED by another driver. EXT. A STREET DOWNTOWN.  DAY. Wilson cruises past a particular building.  We don't have to really clearly see it just yet (we saw it in the flash cuts) -- more important we see him seeing it.  Casing it with the eyes of a professional.  Sniffing it out; the instinct of a predator after prey. INT. CAR.  DAY. Parks it.  Produces the little leather travel kit we saw him unpack at his motel.  Unzips it.  Under the usual assortment of clippers, razors, etc., is a hidden layer -- storing still more personalized items:  a set of select slim lockpicking/cutting tools. EXT. SIDE STREET.  DAY. Wilson locks the car.  Walks away.  STAY with him. AROUND THE CORNER He walks down the block.  A nice long walk.  What we get out of it besides a sense of Wilson -- cool cat; ambling along; loner; sun beating down; not bothered; his shadow doubling him -- is this: The building approaching.  The one he has his eye on.  The target.  It's across the street.  A kind of flat windowless warehouse with adjoining loading yard.  Loading yard surrounded by a chain-link fence -- topped with barbed wire. The actual geography of where he left his car in relation to this building.  Safely around the corner.  And how he might practically get back to it, either this same way or via a more circuitous route round another block. The sense you get in downtown L.A. on a lazy Saturday afternoon that you're in a ghost town.  Particularly in this shabby kind of industrial section. EXT. THE BUILDING. Wilson crosses over to it now.  From sunny to shade. Walks past the chain-link fence.  The padlocked gate, big enough to accommodate the (couple of) trucks parked within the compound. Walks past the closed security door which would appear to be the building's main entrance. Round the next corner -- SEES there's a steel back door as well. Comes around this block again.  Looking surreptitiously around now.  Streets here utterly deserted.  Not even a passing car. Crappy residential building on an opposite corner, SPANISH MUSIC blaring from one of the open windows, but not with a direct view on the loading yard fence on this side.  Wilson nearing it now -- taking something out of his pocket.  One of the mysterious metallic tools from his travel kit.  Snaps his wrist, unfolding the tool with a CRACK.  Wire cutters. He doesn't go for the gate, the padlock, like we might have thought.  He suddenly drops to one knee, in shadow where the fence meets the adjoining building.  SNAP, SNAP, SNAP, SNAP, SNAP -- so quick, with great dexterity, though his face grimaces with the strength he has to exert with each application of pressure -- he cuts just as many links as he knows he needs to push in a little flap of fence and roll under.  Whole thing accomplished in seconds. LOADING YARD Walks fast to the cover of the trucks.  Passes.  Looks around.  Cement loading docks and bays.  Shuttered doors.  He jumps up to one, puts his ear to the metal.  Listens awhile. WILSON Scans the wall for any sign of an alarm box or anything. Then cocks an ear upwards... CAMERA CRANING UP to show us what he hears:  an air-conditioning unit HUMMING away.  Which means someone must be inside. Wilson looks back at his entry options.  Not the loading doors -- but a conventional door at one end, with a conventional lock his eye zeroes in on.  Gets out his tools, going over. INT. WAREHOUSE HALLWAY. A SCRATCHING at the door.  It opens.  He's in. Waits.  Cautious.  Nothing.  He starts along the hallway. INT. WAREHOUSE. A SUPERVISOR (the one from the flash cuts) does a double take as Wilson passes.",

As Valentine greets her, he glances outside where Gordon is approaching Wilson on the deck. EXT. DECK. Wilson SEES Gordon approaching.  Gets ready to greet him. Removes cigarette from mouth, drops it to floor of deck, presses it out under his shoe.  Limbers up his shoulders in a subtle way. Gordon coming towards him.  As if to challenge Wilson's legitimacy as an invited guest.  Closer.  About to speak. But Wilson doesn't even give him a chance to do that.

Valentine had turned his attention back to Adhara and her Girlfriend.  When he glances back to the deck he's a little concerned not to see Gordon anywhere out there anymore -- just Wilson coming back in. WILSON Adjusting his jacket, walking back through the house.  Behind him, people are rushing to the railing and looking over.  A few yells of \"Call an ambulance!\" etc. are heard. VALENTINE Moves that way. WILSON Moving across the room towards the front door.  They are heading right toward each other. WILSON AND VALENTINE Pass each other, eyes locked, almost dream-like.  Wilson's eyes cold, though with the hint of a smile.  Valentine throws a last look back before reaching the deck. EXT. DECK. Valentine pushes through to look over the railing. HIS POV Gordon -- a crumpled, inert heap way down the hill below. VALENTINE Turns to look toward the front door.  Wilson not to be seen. Valentine pushes through the crowd toward the door. EXT. VALENTINE'S HOUSE.  AFTERNOON. Valentine emerges in time to see Ed and Wilson pulling away. Wilson looks at him, impassive, through the passenger window. AVERY Is just arriving in his car.  Valentine gestures at him. Suddenly we HEAR a loud, bass-heavy WHHUUUMMMPPP. Valentine (and a few others) turn toward the sound, which came from: THE GARAGE There is smoke coming from under the door. EXT. CANYON ROAD.  AFTERNOON. Wilson's car practically tobogganing back down the hill. BOOM!  We hear an explosion from back UP the hill. INT. WILSON'S CAR. Ed jumps -- though he's driving.

ADHARA Hits the ground.  She won't be retaliating. WILSON In agony, spinning, trying to reach the knife in his back, but IT'S JUST BEYOND HIS REACH. VALENTINE Scrambles through the sliding glass door. EXT. BIG SUR HOUSE.  BACK PORCH.  NIGHT. Valentine stumbles out.  Notices Avery slumped on the deck, mortally wounded.  Goes to him -- as if concerned -- but actually just to take the gun.  Then runs off the porch toward the STEPS that lead down to the sea. WILSON Comes out after him, the knife still in his back.  So intent on catching Valentine he fails at first to notice Avery lying in the shadows. AVERY Has just barely managed to reach Stacy's pistol.  Raises it weakly.  Points it at Wilson. WILSON Seems to feel it.  Turns.  Locks eyes with Avery.  Avery could already have shot him.  But there's a momentary sense of recognition:  both of them just foot soldiers for fat cats -- and Avery's is not worth saving. AVERY Lowers the gun.  Nods in the direction Valentine went.",

Trying not to slip in the darkness, though there are tiny Malibu lights illuminating the steep and winding wooden framework. EXT. BEACH.  NIGHT. A rocky cove.  Valentine looks back up the way he came, HEARING the FOOTSTEPS coming down after him.  Backs away a few paces on the slippery rocks.  Falls. Lands on the crumpled, dead body of LARRY, the bodyguard, who was thrown off the cliff.  Valentine recoils.  When Wilson appears, Valentine FIRES at him.  A wild shot that only makes Wilson duck momentarily.  Valentine scrambles to his feet, runs on. WILSON Jumps down from the steps.  Stops for a moment and leans his back against the railing.  Bends at the knees slightly. THE KNIFE The handle is forced upward just enough to be reachable now. WILSON Grimacing, pulls the knife out and discards it. FURTHER DOWN THE BEACH Valentine runs.  Or tries to.  It's dark and the ground is treacherous.  The beach runs out pretty soon.  Now just rocks.  Maybe he thought he could get around the rocks on the point at the other end.  But he can't see very far ahead. And the tide is in, water making any escape extremely difficult.  He tries to scramble over some rocks.  They're wet, slippery.  He falls, cries out as he literally breaks an ankle. WILSON A dark figure.  Coming into focus.  Walking inexorably this way. VALENTINE Painfully rights himself.  A small bone protrudes from his broken ankle.  He FIRES at Wilson, gun in one hand, other hand gripping his wrist to try and steady it.  Doing his best to aim.  But the SHOTS miss their mark. WILSON Steadily coming. VALENTINE Out of bullets now.  Gun CLICKING crazily on empty.  He simply drops it. WILSON Now stands before him. THE TWO OF THEM Both breathing hard.",
