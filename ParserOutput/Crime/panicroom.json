He's carrying a bag of some kind. He goes to the door, and we drift down toward the doorknob. We hear a key slide into the door, rattle. But the lock doesn't turn.  The key slides out, back in again, jiggles.  Still won't open the door. The Man steps away from the door, goes to the kitchen window, which is heavily barred, and peers inside, right at us. Can't see anything, it's darker in here than it is out there. He turns, looks both ways on the street again, then steps up, onto the window ledge.  Now we can only see his legs, can't tell what he's doing.  He's reaching up, stretching for something.  It drops into view with a metallic SCRAPE. The fire escape. The Man climbs, his feet disappearing from our field of vision. We turn around, facing the other way in the kitchen.

Sealed water bags stamped \"PURE FIVE YEARS FROM DATE.\" Tinned food. Flares. Pillows, fireproof blankets (we know because the bags are stamped FIREPROOF BLANKET). A complete tool kit. As Sarah explores, she discovers something in the far wall at the end of the room, down on the floor at eye level. It's a small round portal, about eight inches across, with a four-pronged cloverlike seal.  The portal is closed tight, as Sarah pokes and scrapes at it idly with a finger or two, it resists her attempts to crank it open. Meg notices.",

Sarah is crawling around the base of the wall, near to where she was before, clawing at the strange portal thing again. Finally, she finds a small metal handle, folded back into the clover-leaf seal on the portal.  She unfolds it, twists it. The portal cranks open, revealing it to be at the end of a tube, about a foot long, an emergency ventilation source directly through to the exterior of the house.  She bends down and looks through it.  It's covered by a metal mesh at the opposite end, but she can see and smell the outside through it. She sits up, gestures to her mother to bend down next to her. She does, and they both jam their mouths up near the end of the tube, gulping fresh air greedily. Meg looks at Sarah, good job, and they both drop to the floor at the portal and suck air.  It's temporary, but it works.",

She selects one, snatches up a screwdriver. Sarah looks at her, has a vague idea of what she's thinking, but can't believe it.  She shakes her head vehemently. In response, Meg picks up two or three of the fireproof blankets and piles them over Sarah, right up to her disbelieving eyes.  She bends down, takes another gulp of air.  but she's getting woozy.  This can't go on much longer. She staggers across the room, hoists herself back up onto the shelf she stood on before, and gets right up next to the vent.  Holding her breath to avoid breathing the toxic gas, she unscrews the vent cover. The duct is wide enough to put your arm in.  She reaches in, past a bundle of multicolored wires that run down through the wall.  She reaches all the way in, lighter in hand.",

She SCREAMS, he SLAMS the door, she takes off down the hall, reaches the end, throws the door open -- INT.  MASTER BEDROOM - NIGHT -- and races into the master bedroom, where Raoul is motoring, fast, headed for the panic room, where she can already see Burnham, standing in the middle of the open doorway, in front of Sarah, wearing Harris's shirt and a grim \"tricked you\" expression. Meg hurls herself at Raoul, lands clinging to his back.  She claws and wrestles with him, gets one hand on his ski mask, tears it from his head.  He reaches up to try to stop her from pulling it off -- -- his gun slips from his fingers, falls to the floor -- -- and caroms off his boot, spinning across the floor away from them. Raoul flips her off his back violently, she CRUNCHES to the floor, clutching his mask and getting a good long look at his face.  He makes a move toward his gun, but she's faster, she's already pawing herself frantically across the hardwood toward it. Raoul measures the distance, knows he'll lose, and sprints for the panic room instead.  Meg turns, looks down at the medicine in her hands, then at the door to the panic room, where Raoul is right now reaching up to push the button that controls the steel door. She makes a fast decision and lunges, hurling the plastic bottle of Glucogen and the black leather pouch through the gap just before -- -- the spring-loaded steel door SLAMS shut with tremendous ferocity. And then it's silent.  Meg WAILS in agony, POUNDS on the door. She stands back, chest heaving, sobbing. A looooong moment goes by. Finally, a VOICE comes over the house's intercom system.",

The NEIGHBOR -- and by the tone of the voice it sounds like an old woman -- is slow to respond, grumpy. Losing patience, Meg just pulls the Neighbor out of the way and shoves into the house.

From the other side of the wall, we can hear muffled voices, arguing, Meg and the Neighbor shouting at each other. We drift up, up the stairs, and hear the THUNDERING of footsteps on the stairs next door.  We keep pace with them, from inside this house.  We pass right through the floor -- INT.  MASTER BEDROOM - NIGHT -- and rise up out of the floor in the master bedroom, and now we can hear the conversation on the other side of the wall in here, the Neighbor's fearful, angry tones, Meg's firm, urgent declarations. We move with Meg, even though we can't see her, we know what she's doing, she's stepping off the paces on the other side of the wall.

Raoul jabs the button -- -- just as Sarah throws her hand into the upper beam, the one at shoulder level.  Sarah's hand turns red, the beam is broken, the door will not close. Raoul ROARS in anger and twists violently, sending Sarah flying across the room. Meg strains, gets her head off the floor again, breaking the beam.  Raoul starts jamming the close button, over and over again, the beam completes, then breaks, completes, then breaks, never the button and the beam at the same time. But it can't go on forever.  Meg's tiring, she can't keep it up, her head trembles -- -- and collapses onto the floor. The beam completes -- -- Raoul SMACKS the red button -- -- and Burnham appears on the other side of the door.  He reaches in, grabs hold of Raoul, to pull him off her, but Raoul loses his balance, falls forward -- -- into the gap -- -- and his head is crushed by the spring-loaded steel door that SLAMS forward just as Meg draws herself back. Meg falls across the panic room, grabs Sarah, and holds on tight. The door detects the obstruction and opens again, slowly. Raoul's body slumps to the floor, dead. Burnham stands there, looking down at Meg and Sarah. They stare at each other, wordless, their first face to face contact.  She sees the bonds protruding from his jacket. She just looks at him.  There will be no understanding here. He zips his jacket, turns, and hurries away.",

The door SLAMS hard, Burnham turns to run but doesn't get more than a few paces before three sharp GUNSHOTS CRACK through the door behind him. Brilliant white light spills through the bulletholes in the door, but it's not the light that gets you, it's the chunks of lead.  They rip through Burnham's back and come out his chest, a triangle pattern. Burnham stops, sags to his knees.  He reaches into his jacket, pulls out the loose stack of bonds. He fans them out, stares down at them, holds them like playing cards.",

He SLAPS onto his back in the foyer as the wind gusts through the open door, scoops the bonds up off the floor, and blows them back into the house, as if they were never meant to leave. Burnham lies there on the floor, eyes open, staring up at the ceiling, looking at the bonds that swirl in the blast of air, suspended there, twisting and bucking and diving just over his head as he dies.",
