The gaudy sign above the joint reads: CLUB - DANCE HALL. H)   A snapshot of Butch's mother dressed in a somewhat sleazy Latino outfit. She's surrounded by 3 or 4 lounge lizard types, whose hands are all placed on parts of her body. She has a drunken sneer on her face. I)   Snapshot of Butch, 8, being taught to dance in the club by his mother. He looks awkwardly into the camera. J)   Snapshot of Butch, 8, sitting on the bar of the club, surrounded by a motley group of sleazy \"dime dancers\". K)   Another snapshot of Butch being taught to dance by his drunken mother. (NOTE: A heavy MACHINE GROWL should START LOW and INCREASE IN VOLUME through the remainder of these fast-paced series of cuts.) L)   Snapshot of Mom dancing very closely, too closely, to a handsy patron of the club. M)   Snapshot of Mom kissing the same man.   We see a tattoo on his arm. N)   Extreme closeup -- the tattoo. It is of a naked girl. The words \"hell-bent\" in cursive frame the tattoo. O)   Snapshot of Mom sitting on the tattooed man's lap at the bar. His hand is resting on the inner portion of her thigh. P)   Snapshot of Butch at the bar with the club bartender. Q)   Same as (K) -- Butch being taught to dance. (CONTINUED) 106. 161   CONTINUED:    (2)",
