TOAD'S MOTEL ROOM - DAY and the door smashes open and Manny barrels through and shoots a surprised Lizard as she raises her pistol. She crashes backwards into the room, wounded.

Tony, with the tape still stuck across his mouth, smashes kid two, pinned against the blood-stained sink, with the stock of his own Ingram. In the midst of this, the Toad jumps up, wounded but with strength, he tears out the motel room door hysterical gripping the whirring chainsaw in a reflex action. c0NT1NuED #00766",

Tony and Nick sit on a couch stacking twenty dollar bills from the duffel bag and suitcase onto a coffee table. Two men in casual sports clothing sit opposite them in chairs, one of them -- Seidelbaum -- squaring the bills and passing them efficiently through a money-counting machine which clicks at rhythmic intervals throughout the scene. Seidelbaum's a small, fat 7th Avenue-type with a lot of rings on his fingers and sharp, porky eyes. The other guy -- Luis -- a dark Cuban, is long, lean and smooth with aquiline nose and dancing eyes. He drinks coffee, smiles a lot and bullshits -- two sordid guys who look the part. It's a tedious process counting a million five in twenties, it takes four/five hours; and throughout the desultory dialogue Tony, absorbed by the money, and Nick never stop the monotonous work of counting and stacking and noting the At all times all four men, thoroughly aware of amounts. the large stacks on the table, move and talk gingerly although they appear casual and bored.

He  doesn't hesitate, turning his machine gun on Gina. Gina is torn to pieces by the firepower -- blown across the room, spine severed and dead before she hits the floor. Tony sees it, yells something, in the same instant swivels to knock the barrel of the machine gun aside. The punk is taken by surprise, not having seen Tony, and Tony now runs him backwards across the balcony and hurls him over the balustrade. The punk lands in one of the shallow pools on the grounds at the base of the balcony. Tony, from above, grabs up the punk's machine gun and empties the whole clip into the figure thrashing in the pool below.
