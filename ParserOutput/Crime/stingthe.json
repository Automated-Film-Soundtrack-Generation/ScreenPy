Suddenly, Mottola hears shouting coming from somewhere behind him.  He turns around to see a small, weathered looking thief come racing around the corner and down the alley toward him, frantically pursued by a gray-haired black man.  Limping noticeably, the black man manages a few cries for help and then stumbles and falls.  The stranger yells at Mottola to cover his side of the alley, and then readies himself for the arrival of the thief.  Mottola just stands there, not the least interested in the exercise of justice. Just as the thief is about to run on by, the stranger throws his suitcase at the little man's legs, sending him sprawling and separating him from the wallet he's been carrying in his left hand. The stranger makes a dash for the wallet and kicks it back to where Mottola is standing.  Almost by reflex, Mottola picks it up.  The thief scrambles to his feet and starts back toward his new-found enemy, brandishing a knife.  Both the stranger and Mottola brace themselves for an attack. The thief, realizing that there are two people to fight, begins to think better of it.  He is not a young man, nor particularly strong.",
