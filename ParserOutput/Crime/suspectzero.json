BASEMENT - BENEATH THE STAIRS - CONTINUING                  28 Mackelway climbs under the stairs, crouching down, pushing aside all of the aforementioned junk. He grabs the box. Sure enough, that bucket once held red paint - same color O'Ryan used to cover that wall. There's also a bucket of BLACK PAINT here. And some used brushes. Mackelway brings the box into the meager light. We get a look INSIDE IT now. So does Dyson. Inside, beneath the paint-buckets, we see a few TV GUIDES, a yo-yo, a football. Then a BOOK on TRIBAL RITUAL AND TRANCE. Mackelway grabs it, eyes it. He flips through a few pages - odd images: a TRIBESMAN with eyes rolling back in his head, strange rites, etc. Mackelway sets the book down. Then, amidst the other materials in this box, he spots a large folded MAP. He grabs it, begins to unfold it. We see that this map's been written on, in pen. Cities on it have been CIRCLED. But before we can get a good look at it, Mackelway spots something else, at the bottom of this box, a shocker: A photograph of himself. It takes him a second to realize what he's looking at. But there it is, a NEWSPAPER PHOTO, of Agent Thomas Mackelway. It is part of a FRONT-PAGE STORY, dated July of this year, concerning the trial and release...of Virgil Ray Starkey. #7 on the F.B.I.'s Most-Wanted List... Dyson can't help but notice the picture of Mackelway. Mackelway stares. Suddenly we JUMP BACK IN TIME, NINE MONTHS, for a brief, choppy FLASHBACK. 29 29   EXT. STREET - MATAMOROS - NIGHT - MACKELWAY'S FLASHBACK We're RUNNING, dashing between two buildings of chipped-adobe, hearing nothing but the sound of our own breathing and the thuds of our own heavy feet. This is Matamoros, Mexico, a shit-hole of a border town. Squalor and sin. We find a DRUNK MEXICAN TEEN. He nods: \"This is the place,\" and sticks out his palm. 27. 30   INT. HOPE HOUSE - BASEMENT - RESUMING                          30 Mackelway stares at that newspaper: Starkey - rapist, murderer, whose case was just thrown out of court - a stunning failure for all involved. ...as we RESUME MACKELWAY'S FLASHBACK - Matamoros again... 31   INT. \"CLUB\" - BACKSTAGE - RESUMING FLASHBACK                   31 Bad-lighting, drunk patrons in a CIRCLE, and a DONKEY-SHOW taking place on a bare stage. Feels like we've stepped into some kind of evil carnival. It's dizzying. Among the crowd: Virgil Starkey, in an ugly drunken binge, the only guy in here who isn't cheering or laughing. Suddenly our GUN is pointed right at his head. Starkey freezes, caught. Some of the PATRONS around him find somewhere else to stand... But the show goes on. 32   INT. HOPE HOUSE - BASEMENT - RESUMING                          32 That ARTICLE gives us more detail now, the reason Starkey's case was thrown out of court. It is this: The F.B.I. Agent on the case had made a mistake in \"evidentiary procedure.\" Hence, Mackelway's picture. On his face, we GO BACK TO ANOTHER MEMORY: six months ago. 33   INT.

The hall's busy with MEDIA and other traffic. First face he sees is Fran, who sits on a bench, (wedding ring ON). Her eyes say how lousy she feels for him. It almost helps. 36   INT. COURTHOUSE BATHROOM - CONTINUING FLASHBACK                   36 The door bursts open and Mackelway storms in. No need to look composed now; he's alone in here. He crosses to a paper-towel dispenser, SLUGS IT. Stares in the mirror. He's livid, embarrassed, frustrated - can barely look at his own reflection. Then he hears LAUGHTER, behind him. He turns. Out of the darkness of a badly-lit STALL, Virgil Starkey emerges, coming into view under a single light. Beside him is a GRIM COP, his chaperone. Starkey passes by Mackelway, almost snickering. Then he's gone. Mackelway shuts his eyes tight. His head is pounding. END FLASHBACK. 37   INT.

SUB-BASEMENT - CONTINUING                                   63 Mackelway emerges. \"B-2\" looks a lot like B-1: long and endless. We hear air moving around us, pipes carrying water, the wheezing of an old generator... And, on all sides of us, DOOES, a mile of them: maintenance offices, supply rooms, labs. He opens one - a janitor's supply. No one in here. Tries another door. Locked. A second. Locked. A third. Locked. Air sucks through a corridor around us. He thinks he hears footsteps around a corner. Runs at them. 64   INT. SUB-BASEMENT - CORNER - CONTINUING                          64 Nothing. No one. Just another vast corridor. More doors. Then, a sound. GLASS, shattering on the floor. He runs down the corridor, passing a long metal CAGE that houses this building's FIVE FURNACES. They're old and wheezy. It's dark behind them, shadowy. Not a bad place to hide. Farther down the corridor is another door - made of frosted glass. A sign on it reads \"Neuropsychiatric Lab.\" That's where the sound came from... he thinks. 45. 65   INT. SUB-BASEMENT - LAB - CONTINUING                              65 Mackelway enters. The lab is dark. He throws on every light switch within reach... and finds himself standing over the shards of what used to be a GLASS BEAKER. So he's in the right place. He scans it: five rows of work- stations, ten microscopes per row, each with a sink beside it. Lining the walls are wide CABINETS. But there's also a MINI-LIBRARY down here: Four rows of BOOKSHELVES, housing medical journals. These are the \"stacks\" - perfect for hiding behind. He plunges in. Row #1. Doesn't see anyone. Then Row #2, Row #3, Row #4. Okay, the stacks check out... He walks along the rows of work-stations, scanning, crouching, nudging open cabinets. One has been opened: Bottles of SOLUTIONS sit inside it. And a JAR that's been unsealed: It's got GAUZE PADS in it... In the back of the room, an INSTRUCTOR'S DESK awaits. It's tall enough to hide beneath. Mackelway slinks around it. Kneels down, looking into darkness... Then, a NOISE. The FRONT DOOR of this lab just swung open... And O'Ryan just bolted out. Fuck. 66   INT. SUB-BASEMENT - CORRIDOR - CONTINUING                         66 Mackelway emerges from the lab. Those furnaces whine beside him on the other side of that cage. But a GATE on that cage has been left ajar... 67   INT. \"FURNACE ROOM\" - CONTINUING                                  67 Five furnaces, separated from the sub-basement corridor by steel mesh. Mackelway enters. A few meager BULBS burn. He moves amidst shadow and noise: the chugging of engines, the humming, the wheezing, a slight vibration to the floor beneath us. He walks along the edge of Furnace #1... ...and is assaulted, from above. O'Ryan falls on him, knocking Mackelway hard into the sharp CORNER of that furnace, then down to the ground. Mackelway's gun skids across the floor. And his mouth, suddenly, has been covered with gauze. 46. He wants to fight back... but suddenly he finds that his head is swimming. Something's on that gauze. The room is getting fuzzy. We see the belly of a furnace - flames, heat. Then our own BLOOD... (Mackelway's CHEST was torn open by the corner of that furnace.) Wait. Did we just see the glint of a KNIFE? O'Ryan is leaning over us, in utter control. Then O'Ryan's head turns, abruptly - at the sound of FOOTSTEPS. And we hear:",

Inside? Pillows. Fuck. He slams it shut, looks to those cans of food, stacked on shelves. He approaches the shelves, jostling cans from their rows, making more noise than he ought to. But he finds nothing behind them... except more cans. He approaches those two huge drums of water, lugs them aside. Behind them is a tall CUPBOARD, locked. He pulls at the cupboard door, hard.

On it, more of those unidentifiable lines become visible to us. They're called IDEOGRAMS. He holds the point of his pen down upon one of them, as if receiving information from it, and we jump back into: 123   INT. HOPE HOUSE - O'RYAN'S FORMER ROOM - RESUMING                123 Mackelway. Sitting. Staring. Outside this room we hear that awful, toneless singing as it fills the hallway. Mackelway rises, approaching that re-painted wall. He pulls out his keys. Checks to see that no one's watching. 124   INT. MOTEL ROOM - DENTON, TEXAS - RESUMING                       124 O'Ryan, his pen on that pad, his concentration total. 125   INT. HOPE HOUSE - O'RYAN'S FORMER ROOM - RESUMING                125 We hear the singing, the TV, the rain, that bucket collecting drips. Semi-darkness... until MORE LIGHTNING throws a burst of white light against that wall. A faint shape becomes visible, just beneath the white paint. Then it vanishes again. Using his keys, he begins to scratch away at the white paint. It's an irrational thing to do - but in the context of the last few days it makes an odd kind of sense. Instantly, a hint of BLACK can be seen underneath... 126   INT. MOTEL ROOM - DENTON, TEXAS - RESUMING                       126 O'Ryan, at that desk. Outside, he can hear an 18-WHEEL TRUCK rumble by. He doesn't allow it to distract him. 127   INT. HOPE HOUSE - O'RYAN'S FORMER ROOM - RESUMING                127 Mackelway scratches more of the white paint off of that wall. More BLACKNESS appears beneath it. Then, a SOUND behind him. He turns. The door to this room just SHUT; someone outside must've pushed it. He keeps scratching at the paint. LIGHTNING rages outside. We PULL BACK, away from that wall, which gives us the opportunity to see something that Mackelway is too close to the wall to see for himself: 74. There is indeed an image beneath that thin coat of white paint. It is the shape of a vast, black WAVE. A hand-painted image as large as this wall itself. Mackelway seems tiny by comparison, and the mere inch of black that he has uncovered so far seems infinitesimal. In fact, it almost look as if the wave is poised to swallow him whole... and he can't even see it. But we can. Must've taken O'Ryan days to paint something this large. A vast, black wave. Evil itself... And Mackelway, without meaning to, is about to unleash it. 128   INT. MOTEL ROOM - DENTON, TEXAS - RESUMING                        128 O'Ryan, somehow, seems to be sensing what is going on in that room. Or maybe he's just feeling the power of that wave, from memory. Or maybe he's just plain crazy. But he and Mackelway, on some unspoken psychic level, are feeding one another... 129   INT. HOPE HOUSE - O'RYAN'S FORMER ROOM - RESUMING                 129 Mackelway chips away at that white paint, moving rapidly, revealing more of the blackness underneath. We PUSH IN on it, moving past Mackelway and his frantic scraping. Then we're beneath that thin coat of white, and: 130   INT. INSIDE THE BLACK WAVE - UNDETERMINED TIME                    130 Somehow, we've submerged into the wave itself. A black, tidal force of nature. And it is MOVING. Alive. We hear the SOUNDS of it: a sucking, a yawning, as if a tide were drawing back just before exploding forward. The sounds blend in with the wind, the rain, the drops in that bucket... Evil itself, on the move, gathering might. And we're along for the ride... The wave begins to roll forward now as if shot from a cannon. It is massive, powerful, dark. And we're right on its forward edge, as if surfing it somehow. 131   INT. MOTEL ROOM - DENTON, TEXAS - RESUMING                        131 O'Ryan reacts. Something just changed: 75. 132   INT. INSIDE THE BLACK WAVE - RESUMING                             132 The wave is rushing us forward with this speed and power of a tsunami. ...which is when we hear the laughter of a LITTLE BOY. 133   INT. MOTEL ROOM - DENTON, TEXAS - RESUMING                        133 O'Ryan just heard it too. Then new images come at him - but they are, at first, GRAINY, CHOPPY... 134   EXT. UNIDENTIFIED PLAY AREA - SAME                                134 The sounds of that wave become fainter, receding to the background, giving way to that sound of laughter, and the squeaking of a PLAY-SET SWING. Like an old tv slowly gaining reception, the image takes a moment to crystallize before us. But then it sharpens: We're in the PLAY AREA of a TRUCK-STOP DINER, but it feels like we're looking at it through a broken lens. The images appear SPHERICAL to us, surrounded by darkness. Before us a 5-year old plays on a swing. Call him CHARLIE. 135   INT. HOPE HOUSE - O'RYAN'S FORMER ROOM - RESUMING                 135 Mackelway has scraped away more of the white paint now - enough to see the outline of the front edge of the black wave, its lip. He continues. 136   INT. MOTEL ROOM - DENTON, TEXAS - RESUMING                        136 O'Ryan tightens. We can't tell if he experiencing something from the past, the present, the future... 137   EXT. PLAY-AREA - RESUMING                                         137 We WHIP AROUND quickly, getting a look into the diner itself. There, through a window, we see a WOMAN, presumably Charlie's mother. Her name's KATHLEEN, 40. Kathleen has her back turned to us, because she's busy diapering her nine month-old BABY at a table. 138   INT. MOTEL ROOM - DENTON, TEXAS - RESUMING                        138 O'Ryan, at his desk, seems to be getting all of this. And it is agitating him. There's perspiration on his forehead. 76. 139   EXT. PLAY AREA - RESUMING                                      139 The sound of that wave is still a presence. Charlie looks up at us as he swings. His smile is pure, genuine. We whip around for another look at Kathleen. She's still busy with that diaper. Then we look back to Charlie. 140   INT. MOTEL ROOM - RESUMING                                     140 O'Ryan keeps his eyes shut, his focus total... but every part of him is becoming tense. 141   INT. HOPE HOUSE - O'RYAN'S FORMER ROOM - RESUMING              141 Mackelway is beginning to perspire from the effort. More of that wave is visible to him. But he doesn't step back to take that in. 142   EXT. PLAY AREA - RESUMING                                      142 That swing is now EMPTY, dangling gently.

PLAY AREA - RESUMING                                      144 We run... toward a PARKING LOT. But we do so smoothly, without effort, as if being carried by that relentless black wave. Then, ANOTHER SOUND bleeds in. The BANGING of the Diner's back door, which leads on to that Play Area. And we hear a horrified yell:",

He eyes the map... which has now been stuck with over 1,000 BLACK PINS, one for each city with a HAVE YOU SEEN ME to its credit. And those black pins, seen from a distance, form a pattern we weren't expecting - something that never quite took shape when the pins were yellow. Looks like a big black WAVE. And that's just what it is. 1,000 black dots conspiring to form the same exact shape that O'Ryan had painted onto the wall of his room - a massive wave of darkness, gathering strength. But this black wave is consuming America... Mackelway stares at it: awed, even a bit frightened. The thing seems vast, unstoppable... A black wave - pure malevolence, covering the states like a fog.

Then a MAN passes by him, a trucker. Let's call him VIC. All we see as he passes is the TATTOO on his forearm: a cobra. Keys jingle on his belt-hook. He wears a sleeveless down vest and a \"God Bless America\" cap. Mackelway turns, but Vic's already past us. Something about him attracts Mackelway's attention. The walk, the attitude. Something. So Mackelway is watching - without really knowing why - as Vic crosses the parking lot, heading for his rig. It's a beast. Vic climbs in, unaware that he's being watched. Mackelway looks away, chiding himself for allowing the guy to distract him. That WAITRESS comes by with more coffee. Mackelway smiles, looking absently out the window again. And sees a LITTLE BOY of 5, in the cab of Vic's rig... But this little boy is SCREAMING, struggling to get out of his car-seat, until Vic grabs the kid by the shoulders, roughly... all of this visible through the windshield. Mackelway locks in on the kid. Holy shit... Vic's rig pulls out. The kid pounds on his window. Looks like he's saying \"Lemme out of here! I want my Mommy!\" He might be little Charlie - we can't tell from here. But we can see that Vic is yelling at him: \"Shut up!\" And we can see that Vic's truck is refrigerated. He's hauling dairy products. On a normal day, Mackelway might shrug this off as coincidence. He might not be so vigilant. This isn't a normal day. He races for the door. 169   EXT.
