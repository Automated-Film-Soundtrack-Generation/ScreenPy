So think about that: FBI, CIA, DEA, CUSTOMS, TREASURY, ATF, DEFENSE, IRS, Radio Shack and the DMV, they're all gonna want to speak to you.  And that's the good news... You'll also be meeting Senators and Congressman, each with a specially prepared question.  Their question is designed for one thing: to make them look smart.  If you lecture them, they won't think you respect them.  If you respond with utter humility, they will.  Remember, this is about your respect for them, and the President's respect for them. Speaking of which, as soon as he gets back from Russia and China, we'll get you in there for some face- time, let the two of you catch up. (beat) It'd probably be a good idea for you to meet your predecessor.  I'll have Jeff Sheridan take you over. Also, four weeks from today you will give your first official press conference.  In it you will outline the President's strategy for winning the war on drugs. (beat) Okay, anything else?",

On the sink next to her is a little square of well-charred aluminum foil; she's done many hits.  She leans over and picks up a small piece of crack cocaine from a small pile in her soap dish.  She drops it on a clean place on the foil. She picks up a lighter and the tube of a ball point pen she's turned into a straw. She heats the bottom of the foil.  The crack \"crackles.\" She chases the smoke across the foil.  A huge hit.  She leans her head back, her eyes roll back, she tries to focus on the magazine, on anything, she stares up at the ceiling. She holds it as long as she can then blows it toward the exhaust fan. Caroline looks at her watch.  It's 7:20.  She stands suddenly, unsteadily.  She looks at herself in the mirror. She's really high and indecisive.  She looks around wildly. She sees the shower.  She turns it on.  She drops her pajamas. She goes back to the foil and hits another piece of the rock, taking another really big hit.  She crushes the foil and flushes it down the toilet.  She hops in the shower.",

He opens her drawers, dumps little boxes, pulls things off of shelves. He becomes increasingly unhinged, flinging things around her room.  He tosses a stack of magazines.  A fashion magazine, airborne, discharges some contents: a lighter, a plastic tube and a piece of folded aluminum foil fluttering to the ground. Robert stares at the foil on the carpet.  It's charred on the outside.  He picks it up.  And unfolds it.  There's a dried milky white substance. He picks up the tube and lighter and stares at them.  Then, somewhat tentatively, he puts the tube in his mouth.  He holds the lighter under the foil, then heats the milky substance which turns translucent and disappears in a cloud of smoke.  Robert sucks all of it in. He waits a long time then exhales.  His eyes shut.  The tube drops from his mouth.  He staggers and, overwhelmed by the sensations, sits on the bed.  The lighter and foil fall from his hands. A moment later he opens his eyes and doesn't seem to know where he is.  He looks at the room, confused.  He stumbles to the door and shuts it firmly behind him.",
