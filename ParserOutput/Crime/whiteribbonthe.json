But he didn't get much farther than the first window, that's where the trellis ends, see. And even with all his strength, he couldn't hoist himself up on the lightning rod. So the guy stands up there in the window. And what do you think that idiot does: he starts to crow! He crows, shouting: I'm the rooster on the steeple. You'll never catch me! He made such a commotion that little by little the people in the neighborhood started to wake up... At the same time someone else starts to shout, causing the others to join in: FARMHANDS and FARMERS: More beer, more beer, or I'll fall down, hurray! More beer, more beer, or I'll fall down. Has the landlord hung himself, that he doesn't serve me any beer? More beer, more beer, or I'll fall down! Laughter.

In the latter place, some years ago, a mother came to see me. She had noticed that her son, who was about the same age as you, and had the same symptoms that you've been showing for some time. Although until then the boy had been healthy and active,   suddenly   he  showed   a   noticeable weariness, he had dark rings under the eyes, seemed depressed and joyless. The boy had also changed emotionally: before he had been funny, frank, almost naughty, but now he became withdrawn. He tried not to look his parents in the eye, and was caught telling small and even big lies. The pastor has finished the cleaning and feeding, and now sits down behind his desk, Martin opposite him: That lasted approximately half a year. Then everything went very fast: he lost his appetite, couldn't sleep any more, his whole face took on the brownish color of the rings under his eyes, his hands began to shake, his memory stated to fail him, he was covered with numerous small pustules, first on his face, then on his whole body and finally he died. The body, which I blessed, looked like the body of an old man. The pastor watches Martin:",

Since my marriage proposal, Eva had written me once a week, and I got the feeling that she felt lost and alone in the city, and was asking me between the lines to come to see her again, despite of her father's interdiction. I wanted to spend Whitsun Saturday with her so that I could be back on Sunday again and prepare the confirmation feast with the pastor. The steward had gone to the sawmill, but was supposed to be back any minute. His wife, who was busy preparing for Whitsun, asked me into the living room and to wait there for his return.",

LANDSCAPE WITH A BROOK AND PASTURES EXT/DAY Sitting at a brook, Sigi, Ferdinand and Georg have cut willow twigs with their pocketknives and are now carving whistles out of them. Their feet dangle in the water, they're concentrated on their work. Georg is the first to have finished. Proudly he tries it out, but the little whistle doesn't sound very good. He hides his disappointment, and keeps on carving to improve the sound. Then Sigi's whistle is ready and it sounds very good. Sigi is delighted. After a short and proud look over to his rivals, he leans back into the grass and keeps on whistling. Georg looks with irritation at the \"braggart\", and keeps on carving. Then he gives it another try, but the whistle doesn't sound much better than before. Sigi's   whistling   makes   Georg's  seem   ridiculous. Ferdinand looks at Georg with a gloating grin.",

Even if Sigi is no longer the weakling he used to be before his stay in Italy, Georg, who is three years older than him, is much stronger: with the weight of his whole body he charges at Sigi, making him fall backward into the shallow water of the brook, and takes his whistle away. The shock almost knocks out Sigi, and though the stream isn't deep, half of his head lies under the flowing water. Georg sees the danger, but his pride prevents him from helping him, as it means admitting his own unjust behavior. For a moment he hesitates, a helpless and defiant grin on his face. But Ferdinand has already jumped into the water and pulls out Sigi, who shakes his head to fully come to his senses. Ferdinand looks up at Georg, who is standing on the bank, still holding the whistle in his hand. Then Georg points his finger at him, and says furiously and guiltily.",

The three searchers, who have found nothing, meet again in the stairwell. 76. THE MIDWIFE'S HOUSE EXT/DAY The schoolteacher, the steward and his wife come out from behind the house, leave the property and go their separate ways on the street. All that is left is the empty house with its closed shutters. NARRATOR: During the next few weeks, the village gossip-factory worked overtime. Some claimed, the doctor was Hansi's father. He and the midwife had tried to abort the child so that the shame of their relationship wouldn't be found out, and that's how the child became disabled. Others even went as far as to claim that there was something fishy about the death of the doctor's wife, and that they wouldn't be surprised, if the two weren't responsible for it. 77. MONTAGE: EXT/DAY The houses of the doctor, the pastor, the farmer, the street before the school, the estate's administrative buildings and the manor house. There is nobody to be seen. NARRATOR: Whoever had lynched the boy obviously knew about the hidden crimes of his parents.",
