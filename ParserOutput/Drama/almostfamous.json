As always, Russell sets the tone.  He's feeling good. Stillwater takes over -- they feel mighty, like the Beetles, as they climb across chairs, rearrange wall hangings and gold records  and head down the small hallway to the control room interview.  Rolling with the flow are William and Penny in her green coat.  He tries to distance himself from her -- still a little stung by the earlier hallway rebuff -- but she will have none of it.  She privately shares every great passing moment with him.  He tries not to succumb to these charms. It's hard.  Music segues to Stillwater's own \"Fever Dog.\"",

He feels silly, and they know it, and he hates that they know it, which makes him feel foolish.  He sits silently.  William watches him from four rows back, next to Penny.  She kisses the top of his forehead, a hero's welcome. He yawns. The song's vocal begins.  There is only more silence.  Then, after a beat, we hear a voice or two, fighting the quiet and singing along.  Then others... waking up... joining in.  Then Jeff.
