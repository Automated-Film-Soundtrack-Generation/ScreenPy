STEPHEN CRANE PROJECTS - MORNING                        331 The tall buildings cast long shadows of dread on every activity below, no matter how routine: A woman pushing a stroller, guys shooting hoops, a couple arguing, kids on bikes, old men resting on a graffiti-covered bench. The unmarked cars drive slowly through it all. The place teeters on the brink of violence you can feel as gangs move under the shadow of the towers. 332    INT. GROUND FLOOR, SOUTH TOWER, THE PROJECTS - DAY           332 Richie removes the cover plate of an elevator, cuts the wires, disengaging it, then leads the Amigos, followed by more detectives to a stairwell.

STAIRWELL - FLOORS - SOUTH TOWER - DAY                  333 Floor by floor, they work their way up the tower like commandos, the squalor and decay and hopelessness somehow intensifying the higher up they go. Reaching the 17th floor, they listen to a strange sound before easing the fire door open enough to see a kid on a Big Wheels pedalling straight at them. He passes and the sound fades. 334    INT. 17TH FLOOR HALLWAY - DAY                                334 Half the apartment doors are gone. TVs and radios echo, voices argue, infants wail. The detectives come around a corner and see at the end of it: a couple of guys with a sawed-off shotguns sitting outside a closed door. They step back. Consider one other. Spearman volunteers with a nod, continues on alone as the others wait. He walks up to the guys with the guns.",

I got business with Teddy and it's none of your fuckin business except to knock on the fuckin door and get him.

But Teddy's gone. He sees a tapestry of a tiger on a wall. Pulls at it, finds a big hole knocked into another dark apartment, climbs through, sees an open door - 336   INT. THE PROJECTS BUILDING - CONTINUOUS                        336 As Richie rushes out to the hallway he can hear footfalls echoing in the stairwell. He starts down, taking the stairs five at a time, chases Teddy down two flights - Teddy yanks open a door, runs down a corridor, bangs into an apartment. Richie reaches the apartment just as Teddy is goes out onto an exterior balcony - Richie continues along the interior corridor, running parallel to Teddy on the balcony, who trips over some debris and garbage, looking over his shoulder for Richie - Richie cuts through another apartment to head him off, but the door to the balcony is nailed shut. So are the windows. Richie looks around, grabs a small portable television and, just as Teddy runs past, hurls it through a window at him, hitting him in the head. He falls hard, dazed. Richie hurries through the broken window. Teddy comes to and fights back, until Richie breaks his femur with his bare hands. Teddy howls in excruciating pain - 337   INT/EXT.

As Frank moves through the gallery, Richie sees it's full of the gangster's friends, many of them celebrities, who smile and greet and fawn as if the Pope has arrived. Richie has evidence tables covered with cash, weapons, stocks, bonds, property deeds, pictures of Frank's holdings, heroin in blue cellophane. Frank has celebrities, community leaders, Joe Louis himself who will testify to Frank's benevolent character. The Champ hugs the heroin trafficker warmly in front of everyone and Richie wonders if he should just give up now. Richie sees it in slow motion: the hands reaching out to Frank, the pats on his back, lipsticked mouths of beautiful women offering kisses and words of encouragement, his old mother giving him a hug. He watches Frank's head turn slowly, his eyes passing his phalanx of attorneys, the jury, finally settling on Richie in his cheap suit seated at the prosecutors table. Frank's eyes smile as they regard Richie, and seem to ask, Can you see this - can you see what you're up against - can you see how insignificant you are? Reaching the end of the welcoming line finally, Frank brushes by Richie and disappears from view somewhere within the protective husk of his multi-million-dollar legal team.",
