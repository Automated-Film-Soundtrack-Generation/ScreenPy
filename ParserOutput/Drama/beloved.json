Bugs and human debris swirl around their legs and feet. Mud covering them through the cracks of the scrap lumber roof. Some finds rest. other's minds are long gone. Camera finds Paul...HE IS SCREAMING. But there is no sound coming from his mouth. Tears flow down his face, but when he touches them, he realizes; They are tears of mud. He looks up and the wooden planked roof is breaking under the power of the rain..He looks down and the water is up to his thighs. Suddenly, the chain linking his feet is pulled and he is knocked down..He gets up, searches through the mud for the chain and notices it's slack..He pulls as well.... One by one the men in the boxes realize the chain's end is being undone by the rain, as camera tracks down towards the last box to the dirt wall, into which the chain has been locked...It is giving way within the muddy wall.

INT. 124 BLUESTONE RD. - MORNING. Camera opens on the front hall and moves through the house, revealing the same neglect inside; Broken furniture, dusty floors, mess and disorder... Camera enters; INT. KITCHEN - MORNING. Dirty pans, crusted food on the table, window curtains hanging askew... Sethe sits hunched over, asleep, in a chair against the wall. She wears a dirty, torn dress that hangs on her body - which seems withered, frailer since we last saw her...In her lap lies a clean pretty dress she was in the process of sewing when she fell asleep from fatigue. A LOUD CRASH wakes her up. Followed by a LOUD FRUSTRATED YELL. Her face registers fear. She realizes where she is, what time it is...and begins organizing breakfast... She places the dress neatly on the chair, then grabs a cloth and wipes away the crumbs and dirty plates from supper, placing them in the sink... She opens a pantry cupboard to reveal BARE SHELVES except for a SINGLE EGG and a bowl of HOMINY GRAINS about 1/4 full. She searches in a panic for more food - anywhere - opening cabinets, doors - places that never stored food. She realizes there is none left. INT. DENVER'S ROOM - MORNING. Denver finished dressing. She has been able to maintain a semblance of order about her person and room.. But as she steps out into the second floor hallway, we see the same disarray as downstairs... She passes by Baby Sugg's old room and discovers; BELOVED, sprawled across the bed, half naked. Her belly is huge, her body unwashed. She looks, and behaves, like a wild animal... A broken lamp lies on the fall - pushed over by her leg as she shifted in bed. Her feet, overhanging the bed, are still touching the bedside table where the lamp sat. She is awake now - making a small hole larger in Baby Sugg's old quilt.",
