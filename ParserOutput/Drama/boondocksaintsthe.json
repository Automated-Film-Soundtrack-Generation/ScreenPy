Dolly and Duffy listen to GREENLY, an obvious rookie, give his over-confident theory of what took place. The chief is about to interrupt them, but Smecker holds him back with a smile.

                    "raw_text": ". EMERGENCY ROOM  DAY A potent song takes our ears as The MacManus brothers sit in the E.R. They have already received care. Their faces are beaten and there are bandages and dried blood in various spots. Connor's injuries exceed Murphy's. They are both clad in only their leather boots, boxer shorts and worn out old bathrobes. Young kids wait for medical attention, as their knife wounds bleed. Two nuns in the corner console a third, whose robes are ripped and face is beaten. A woman toward the end of the hall is so badly beaten she is unrecognizable. As the song builds to a more harrowing chorus, a man enters. His clothes suggest he's a pimp. He is not injured. He looks around as he stands, perturbed, at the end of the hall. He reaches over and grabs the beat up woman by the hair and begins to drag her out. She is kicking and screaming from the floor, grabbing at his wrists as he hauls her away. (Slo-mo) The boys, instantly furious, stand and begin to go toward the action, but Connor's legs give out on him and he falls to the floor. Connor, still trying to go after the pimp, crawls towards him. Murphy helps his brother to his chair and hold him tight.",

Vladdy has a large bandage around his head. The boys stand in surprise. Ivan smashes Connor in the forehead with his gun, sending blood gushing down his face as he falls to the floor. Murphy helplessly yells his brother's name as he is brought to his knees by Vladdy. Ivan positions Connor on his knees before the toilet, which is open to the room.

Bam! He is crushed by the toilet. Boom! His gun goes off, punching a hole in the dumpster near the bottom. Vladdy hears the bang and crouches as he turns to see a wave of tiny porcelain bits. Connor lands squarely on Vladdy's back. His gun discharges firing a hole in the brick of the opposing wall. He is savagely crushed against the ground. Connor bounces off and hits the wall, landing in the garbage completely unconscious. Murphy takes his hands from his head. There is dead silence. He runs to his brother, pulls him from the trash and checks his vital signs. He seems okay. Vladdy, still alive, slowly crawls for his gun, inadvertently covering his own bullet casing. Murphy goes over, picks up the tank cover and clubs the man to death with two hard and fast blows, then throws it up and behind him. It lands in the dumpster with a resonating boom. Murphy quickly takes everything from the scene; guns, money, wallets, watches and a pager. He shoves it in a garbage bag and throws Connor over his shoulder and runs out of the alley.",

There is one corpse directly in the middle of the living room, making eight. This victim (THE FAT MAN) is overweight and is lying in debris made up of sheet rock and broken wood which spreads thinly for a five foot radius around him. The victims' body positions are in a circle with the fat man as the hub. Smecker is instantly engulfed. The regular homicide detectives are on hand with their I.D.s hanging out of their breast pockets. They see Smecker and back off. Duffy wears an especially loud tie. Smecker lights up a smoke.

He stretches his neck over and bites at the collar of his p- coat. He gathers as much of the material in his mouth as he can. He starts to yell, \"Do it!\" but it is muffled. Connor, still sobbing, begins to kick his brother's left hand repeatedly. He turns it into a bloody piece of broken meat as Murphy screams through the shirt. Finally, it is broken enough and Murphy pulls it through the cuff. He stands and breaks the chair into pieces and grabs the sharpest piece. Hojo enters and Murphy shoves the sharp stick up through the bottom of his chin into his head. He drags him around the room yelling mumbo jumbo into his face as Connor jumps up and down in his chair in rage, wanting a piece of the action. Murphy throws the man down and Connor proceeds to viciously kick his dead body. The two have turned into barbarians. Murphy removes the man's two guns, shiny nickel-plated 45s.",

They are gently placing pennies in his eye and sobbing as they begin to recite the prayer. As they speak, Il Duce watches. He then begins to whisper the prayer right along with them. Their words match up perfectly. He leans against the wall, holsters his guns, and withdraws a cigarette. He rolls it along his tongue and twists it into his lips. The boys are still reciting as he strikes a match. They react instantly. Still kneeling they each point a nickel-plated 45 toward The Duke. They turn in time to see the light from the match illuminate his face. Il Duce pauses then he strides into the room and proceeds to recite the last half of the prayer. He stops between the kneeling boys and finishes off the prayer. The boys are stunned as they realize this is their father. He makes the sign of the cross over Rocco. Then he looks down to the upturned faces of his sons. He places a hand on each of their cheeks.",
