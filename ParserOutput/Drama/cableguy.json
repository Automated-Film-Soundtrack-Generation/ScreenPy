THROUGH THE PEEPHOLE The CABLE GUY is walking away. INT. STEVEN'S LIVING ROOM/HALLWAY - DAY Steven opens the door and yells to the Cable Guy. (Revised 11/14/95 - Pink) STEVEN Hey, wait! The Cable Guy turns back. CABLE GUY Well, look who decided to show up. I was just gonna go collect my retirement pension. The Cable Guy wears a clean white jump suit, and is extremely confident despite the fact that he speaks with a slight lisp. This lisp gives him a child-like quality. STEVEN You were supposed to be here four hours ago. CABLE GUY Was I? So I'm the tardy one. Good to know. STEVEN Yes. I had to go to the Bed 'n Bath place, but now it's closed. CABLE GUY (turns to leave) Maybe I shouldn't have come at all  jerk off! (turns back smiling) I'm just joking. Let's do this. (looks around) Oh, the old McNair place. I never thought they'd get the floors clean after what happened here. STEVEN What happened? CABLE GUY (long beat) They had a lot of cats. They walk into Steven's living room. CABLE GUY Hey, this could be a cool pad. Here is a comment card. He pulls out a card, and hands it to Steven without turning back to look at him. CABLE GUY Please mail it in when I am done. STEVEN These go to your boss? CABLE GUY No, they go to me. I'm a perfectioniss... perfectioniss... (he strains to lose his lisp) perfectioniss...t. Now let's take a look at what we're dealing with. The Cable Guy walks around the room with his hands out, sensing the space. CABLE GUY Come on baby. Come on baby. Talk to me baby. Tell me where you like it. That's it baby. He zones in on one wall. He fells the wall in a sensuous manner. CABLE GUY Here's your sweet spot. He pulls out his drill, and begins drilling. CABLE GUY So your lady kicked you out. STEVEN What? CABLE GUY In preparing your service I noticed you were previously wired across town at 1268 and a half Chestnut. Last week the billing was transferred to one Robin Harris. Smells like heartbreak to me. STEVEN I really don't want to talk about it with you. Could you please just install my cable? I'm going to get dressed. CABLE GUY No sweat. Steven walks away, into the hallway. A moment later the Cable Guy runs to him. CABLE GUY Hey, I'm going to go to the hallway so I can access the floorboards. Don't be spooked if you hear someone crawling underneath you. STEVEN Okay, whatever. Steven walks toward his bedroom. CABLE GUY Put on your bathing suit 'cause you'll be channel surfing in no time. The Cable Guy pulls the trigger on his drill twice to punctuate his joke. 13",

                    "raw_text": "UP - THE TELEVISION RIKKI KLIEMAN from COURT TV broadcasts from their studio. RIKKI KLIEMAN (to camera) So ends day fifty-four of the trial of former child star Sam Sweet who has been accused of shooting his twin brother, Stan, in cold blood. The twins were stars of the hit sitcom \"Double Trouble\" which aired from nineteen seventy-seven till nineteen eighty-four. A video package rolls in - We see several photographs of Sam Sweet and his twin brother at various ages. Included is the cast photo of \"Double Trouble.\" Pictured in the photo are eight-year- old Stan and Sam and Conrad Janis as their single dad. We see a brief clip from \"Double Trouble,\" starring the two eight-year-old boys, then a shot of Sam Sweet being taken out of a police car in handcuffs. RIKKI KLIEMAN (to camera) Life wasn't so sweet after the cancellation of their program. Hollywood chewed them up and spit them out. A frustrated Sam turned to petty larceny, while his more impressionable brother, Stan, fell in with a fringe cult called \"The Brotherhood of Friends.\" Reduced to tabloid fodder a fury was growing inside of Sam. A burning need to be recognized as an individual, not a person famous for having an identical twin. A need that took the form of four shotgun blasts on the night of November fourteenth. And so today his attorneys continue the unusual defense of \"Twin Envy.\" ANGLE ON Steven re-enters the room. The Cable Guy is watching television. STEVEN How's it going? The Cable Guy holds up one finger as if to say \"quiet.\" His eyes never leave the TV. CABLE GUY Guilty, guilty, guilt-freakin-tee. I hope they fry this bastard. Steven sees that the Cable Guy has completely redecorated the room in a fashion which makes the room impractical for anything other than watching television. The TV is now on the stairs blocking the entrance into the living room. All furniture faces the TV, making conversation impossible. STEVEN (looks around) What happened? CABLE GUY (jumps to his feet) The arrangement of your major appliances and your furniture was causing some noisy pics and hum bars in your reception. I moved a few things. Cleared it right up. Is that cool? STEVEN (non-confrontational) I... guess so. CABLE GUY You programmed? (off of Steven's look) Then let me slave your remotes. He picks up Steven's remotes, punches in a complicated series of commands, then points them at each other. As he holds them together he makes a face as if their power is surging through him. CABLE GUY Ooh, maybe we should leave these two alone. STEVEN So after this I'll only need one remote for everything? CABLE GUY You know you're pretty good at this. You could be a cable guy yourself. (he finishes) Now let me check your levels. With amazing alacrity he adjusts color setting, sound controls, closed captioned, etc. Then he clicks through the channels. A music video, documentary on Hitler, Oprah Winfrey Show, starving kids, Barney, court TV. The Cable Guy watches emotionless. CABLE GUY All right. That about does it. I just have some paperwork for you to fill out. Sign here. Steven does. CABLE GUY That gave me power of attorney over you. (beat) Joking. Steven laughs. The Cable Guy joins him, but then continues to laugh way too hard for way too long. As the laugh ends it quickly turns into an awkward moment. The Cable Guy does not want to leave. CABLE GUY I'm about finished here. (beat) Okay. I feel good about this. Cable Guy walks to the door. STEVEN One thing. CABLE GUY (turns back immediately) Yeah! STEVEN I... uh... I have this friend and he said he gave his cable guy fifty bucks and he got free movie channels. Have you ever heard of anything like that? CABLE GUY (deadly serious) You mean illegal cable? STEVEN Uh... yes. CABLE GUY Who told you that? I want his name. STEVEN Forget it. CABLE GUY You're offering me a bribe? What you have just done is illegal, and in this state if convicted, you could be fined five-thousand dollars or spend six months in a correctional facility. STEVEN Please... that was dumb. I was just making conversation CABLE GUY (laughs) I'm just jerking your chain. Wake up little snoozy. I'll juice you up. All it is is a push of a button. He puts his arm around Steven and walks him toward the front door. STEVEN Oh, great. How much? CABLE GUY Don't worry about it. I couldn't charge you. Your girl just booted you. Consider it one guy doing another guy a solid. STEVEN That is so nice. CABLE GUY Hey, you're a 'nice' guy. You'd be surprised how many customers treat you like shit, like I'm a god damn plumber or something. (hands him a card) Here is my personal beeper number. It's just for my preferred customers. Never call the company, they'll just put you on hold. STEVEN Thanks. Really. (holds up comment card - jokes) You're gonna get some good marks here. CABLE GUY Maybe some day I'll take you out to the satellite and show you how all this stuff works. It's really incredible. STEVEN Sure. We should do that one day. CABLE GUY How 'bout tomorrow? STEVEN Tomorrow? Tomorrow's not good. CABLE GUY What are you going to do, sit home and stew about your ex? STEVEN No. CABLE GUY (insulted) Oh, okay. I guess I crossed the line. Sorry. STEVEN (guilty) You didn't cross the line. CABLE GUY No? Cool. I'll pick you up at six-thirty. On the flip side. The Cable Guy leaves before Steven can reconsider. Steven cannot believe he just got roped into that. (End Revision - Pink) 14",

The facility has two tennis courts, an Olympic size pool and full gym, with a stage if the residents decide they want to perform \"Oklahoma.\" Everyone laughs. Steven is very good at his job. STEVEN The kitsch appeal of living in an old schoolhouse should be very attractive to young, upwardly mobile home buyers. And most important, the structure is available in foreclosure. If we put down a cash bid, we're going to steal this thing. There is a pause, then everyone applauds. Mr. Daniels walks over to Steven and puts a proud arm around him. They speak as the meeting breaks up. MR. DANIELS Great work Steve-o. So you're feeling good? STEVE Yeah. MR. DANIELS Did I hear something about you having some troubles at home? STEVE Robin and I have been having a difficult time. I moved out, but I really think it's only temporary. MR. DANIELS Gotcha. I love this project, but it's a big mother. Know what I mean? If it fails, corporate's going to have my ass. I've got confidence in you, but you hear where I'm coming from, bro? STEVEN Absolutely. Now I've got more time than ever. It's a good thing. (laughs) I know I can pull this thing off. MR. DANIELS (playfully) Then what are you doing talking to me? You've got a lot of work to do. Get to it! STEVEN Thank you. I will.

ROBIN'S OFFICE AT SASSY MAGAZINE - DAY ROBIN HARRIS, an attractive woman in her late twenties, sits at her desk at \"Sassy Magazine.\" Her office is fairly nice, but she is definitely not at the upper level of the company yet. There are papers spread all over her desk. On her walls are pictures from the magazine, and articles she has written. Steven peeks his head in her door. STEVEN Hello. Robin's face drops. ROBIN Steven, what are you doing here? STEVEN I was just in the area. Thought I'd pop by. How's work? How'd the big teen crush article come out? (Revised 11/13/95 - Blue) ROBIN They liked it. (beat) I thought we agreed we weren't going to see each other for a month. STEVEN I know, it's just Daniels accepted my proposal to renovate the old schoolhouse. ROBIN That's wonderful, congratulations. STEVEN I know I'm breaking the rules, but come have dinner with me tonight to celebrate. ROBIN I don't think we should. STEVEN Come on, this is the biggest day of my career. ROBIN Don't put me in this position. STEVEN What position? I want to share this with you. ROBIN (feeling pressured) I love you, but I need to take some time on my own to see how I feel. You agreed to this. I mean... this is exactly why we broke up, because you never listen to me. STEVE What? Now we're broken up? What happened to 'trial separation?' ROBIN I can't get into this now. If you haven't noticed, I'm at work. STEVE Sorry to disturb you. He turns to leave. (Revised 11/14/95 - Pink) ROBIN (sincerely) Steven. Congratulations. I know how much this means to you. You deserve it. STEVEN Thanks. He leaves. 17",

STEVEN She said she felt pressured. Can you believe that? CABLE GUY Women are a labyrinth. Can I be frank? I don't think you listen to her. I think you try to tell her what she wants to hear. She wants you to thirst for knowledge about who she is. All the complicated splendor that is woman. When your love is truly giving, it will come back to you ten-fold. STEVEN You're right.

ROBIN Sometimes time apart is healthy. STEVEN You're right. Well, that's what I came here to say. Look, I've got to get back to the office. He starts getting up.

TABITHA SOREN Today in the Sam Sweet case the prosecution played the 911 call that Sam Sweet made the night he murdered his brother. Keep in mind, he confessed one month later. The courtroom listens to a 911 phone call. The transcription is seen on the screen. SAM SWEET V ON THE TAPE (crying and babbling) Hello, please send help. My twin brother has been shot. 911 OPERATOR Slow down sir. What happened? SAM SWEET Oh my god, they shot him with a shot gun four times. I mean I think it was a shotgun. Who would do such a thing?!

                    "raw_text": "Steven is playing a pick-up, full court basketball game with some of his friends. It is a competitive, but friendly game. Steven is on skins, Rick is on shirts. STEVEN Here, here, here. A player passes to Steven. Rick is covering him. Steven drives to the basket and puts in a lay up. RICK (to himself) Shit! My fault! My fault! STEVEN Not your fault. I'm in the zone. There is no stopping me today. Play begins again. A player named JEFF takes the ball out, then passes to a heavy-set player who catches the ball, then drives to the basket. When he does he twists his ankle, dropping the ball. The ball rolls out of bounds into a dark corner of the gym. We follow it as it rolls on the ground until it hits a man's sneaker. A pair of hands pick up the ball. The camera tilts up the man's body. It is the Cable Guy. He is holding another ball. He starts dribbling the two balls in a circular pattern. CABLE GUY Hey, you guys play here, too? Cool. I was just in the neighborhood. Thought I'd run the court for a couple of innings. RICK (gestures to injured player) Great. We need another man. STEVEN This is... Chip Douglas... my cable guy. Rick smiles in recognition. CABLE GUY We met about a week ago during a routine installation, but I feel like I've known him my whole life. Steven can't believe this is happening. RICK Oh really. That's sweet. All right Chip Douglas, you're on shirts. Let's play. CABLE GUY No, I want to be on Steven's team. I'm skins. The Cable Guy quickly takes off his shirt. Steven looks shocked because underneath his clothes he is rippled with muscles. The dichotomy between his nerdy face, and his awesome physique is scary. JEFF I don't care, I'll be shirts. Let's just play. CABLE GUY Wait a sec'. I've got to warm up. The Cable Guy starts running wind sprints across the court, touching all the main lines. Everyone stares at him until he finishes. CABLE GUY Let's get it on! STEVEN Are you any good? CABLE GUY Feed me under the boards and you'll find out. Play begins. The shirts inbound to Jeff. The Cable Guy is all over him, covering him as tightly as humanly possible. He keeps his hands near Jeff's face, whacks him in the back as he dribbles, etc. He couldn't be more annoying. Jeff passes to Rick who drives to the basket and puts up a shot which goes in. Rick and Jeff slap hands. CABLE GUY (doing the traveling hand signal) Traveling! That's traveling! RICK Yeah, whatever you say Chip. Everyone runs down the court, ignoring him. CABLE GUY All right, so we're playing that type of game. Prison rules. I get it. Steven takes the ball out. The cable Guy runs around the court, attempting to get open. He criss crosses all over the court. CABLE GUY Feed me the rock! Feed me the rock! I'm open! Steven passes to the Cable Guy, who drives to the basket, pushing Jeff out of the way in the process. The ball goes in. CABLE GUY (does the foul hand signal) And one! That's definitely a foul! (to Jeff) You want to mug me, my wallet is in my other pants. STEVEN (to Cable Guy) What are you doing? CABLE GUY Don't play from fear Steven. We can take these guys. MUSIC UP - SLOW MOTION - STEVEN'S P.O.V. a. The shirts put a shot which doesn't go in. The Cable Guy swings his elbows wildly as he pulls it down. b. The Cable Guy drives to the basket in slow motion violently taking down two men, including Rick. c. Rick drives to the basket. On his way he fakes out Steven who falls to the floor. Rick scores. The Cable guy helps Steven up. As the Cable Guy walks across the court he bangs shoulders with Rick. d. The cable Guy passes the ball to Steven, then sets a nasty pick against Rick, who goes down hard. CABLE GUY Take it to the hole! Steven is so un-nerved by the Cable Guy's behavior that he misses a simple lay up. Steven grabs his own rebound. When he puts up a second shot, Rick gently fouls him. Steven stumbles to the ground. The ball does not go in. CABLE GUY Hey, are you okay? He pulls Steven up. STEVEN Yeah. I'm fine. CABLE GUY Let's switch. I'll cover Rick. The cable Guy gets in Rick's face and gives him a death stare. Steven takes out the ball. He passes to a teammate who passes it to the Cable Guy who drives to the basket, then literally steps on Rick's back and leaps into the air and dunks the ball. RICK (enraged) What the hell was that? That's it. I've had enough. Everyone begins to exit the court. JEFF Thanks for bringing your \"friend\". The Cable Guy runs up to Rick. CABLE GUY Good game. (slaps Rick on the butt) You were tough out there. Your play brought me up to a higher level. I mean that. RICK (dismissive) Yeah. He shakes his head and exits with the rest of the players. STEVEN What are you doing? CABLE GUY It was payback time. I was protecting you. (Revised 11/14/95 - Pink) STEVEN You ruined the game. CABLE GUY I don't appreciate your tone Steven. That's not the way friends speak to each other. STEVEN What are you talking about? I don't even know you! CABLE GUY Well let's fix that. Let me buy you a Heineken? STEVEN No, I'm going home. Steven turns to leave. CABLE GUY Well, uh, I guess we'll talk later. I've got to go shower up and do some stuff. I'll call you if I get a chance. Or you call me... or something. The Cable guy puts his hand up for Steven to high five. Steven slaps it halfheartedly. Then the cable guy extends his palm out low by his knee. CABLE GUY And down low. Steven stares at it for a beat. The cable Guy waits. He'll wait as long as it takes. Finally Steven gives him a low five just so he can leave. CABLE GUY (pulls his hand away so Steven misses it) Too slow. Have a good one. STEVEN (as he walks away) Yeah, have a good one. 26",

Then he checks his message machine as he prepares the meal. He begins chopping an onion. (Revised 11/13/95 - Blue) MESSAGE VOICE You have eleven messages. STEVEN'S MOTHER (ON THE MACHINE) Steven, it's mom. Give me a call. I'm still your mother. STEVEN'S FATHER (ON THE MACHINE) I'm getting on. Steven call your mother. CABLE GUY (ON THE MACHINE) Hey Steven. Just checking in. Give me a ring. I'm at 555-4329. (beep) What's up Steven? I'm at a pay phone. If you're there pick up. Pick up. Pick up. Okay, I'll be home later. I'll talk to you then. Steven stops chopping. CABLE GUY (ON THE MACHINE) (beep) Okay I'm home now. Give me a buzz when you get in. I'll be here pretty much all night. Bye. (beep tone) Hey Steven. Quick question, give me a call when you get a chance. (beep tone) I was just taking a whiz, thought you might have called. Okay later. (beep tone) Sorry, I had call waiting, didn't get to it, thought it might have been you. All right, bye. Steven is beginning to get a little wigged out by this. He fast forwards through a sampling of the rest of the calls. CABLE GUY (fast forwards) ...We're having ourselves quite a little game of phone tag here. You're it! (fast forwards) ...I was just blow drying my hair and I thought I heard the phone ringing. (fast forwards) ...you're a tough man to reach. (fast forwards) I guess you're too busy to call your friends. (Revision Ends - Blue) Steven fast forwards the machine. All he hears is sighing. Then CABLE GUY (ON THE MACHINE) (long beat - then quiet and distant) Shit. The doorbell rings. Steven takes a deep breath then opens the door. It is Robin. She is dressed casually, but looks beautiful. STEVEN Hey, good to see you. There is an awkward moment where Steven intentionally doesn't kiss her hello. STEVEN Come on in. What do you think of the place? She looks at the odd placement of furniture. ROBIN You made some interesting choices laying out the room. STEVEN (embarrassed) That's actually where the movers put the furniture. I'm gonna change it, very soon. ROBIN No, I like it. 27",

STEVEN Don't get me started. That guy has no vision. It's like working for Mr. MaGoo. He's just worthless. ROBIN It's just great that you're getting to do it. It's a real step up. STEVEN I know. Now if only someone at corporate smartened up enough to dump Hal, then I could really get some stuff done. ROBIN It's nice to see you doing so well. STEVEN Well, it's nice just to see you. (looks at his watch) Hey, it should be starting. They sit on the couch. Robin moves to sit in closer to Steven. Steven turns on the television. The screen is filled with white noise. The sound is loud static. He changes channels looking for the signal. Then fumbles with the remote control as he attempts to lower the volume. STEVEN Damn cable is out. Son of a bitch. ROBIN It's alright. We can watch it another night. STEVEN No, no. We really should see it now. Now's a good time. He plays with the remote, hoping it will magically come back. It doesn't. STEVEN Wait, wait. I know what to do. He walks over to the phone, then pulls the Cable Guy's beeper number out of his wallet. He dials it, then presses the number in. STEVEN The Cable Guy's a friend of mine. I'll just page him. We'll have this fixed in no time. (Revised 11/14/95 - Pink) Steven dials the Cable Guy's beeper number into the phone. The moment he is finished dialing THERE IS A KNOCK - THE CAMERA WHIP PANS TO THE DOOR Steven walks to the door and opens it. Standing there is the Cable Guy looking dark and disturbed, different than we've ever seen him before. Steven is startled. STEVEN That was... fast. CABLE GUY Is there a problem with your service? STEVEN Yeah... my cable went out. Steven pushes him out into the hall. CABLE GUY Really? The Cable Guy holds up a cut cable cord. CABLE GUY So you called me. Interesting how you call when you need something. Is that how you treat people? STEVEN I've been really busy. You've got to get my cable going, Robin is here. This is really important. He peeks in to get a look at Robin. They make momentary eye contact. Steven pushes him back out. CABLE GUY But calling me back isn't? STEVEN I'm sorry. Please, you've got to help me. CABLE GUY Why should I help you? I gave you free cable. What have you ever done for me? STEVEN Anything you want. Name it  quickly. CABLE GUY Tomorrow night, we hang out. STEVEN Fine, whatever you want. CABLE GUY God bless you. You're too good to me. The Cable Guy walks over to a fuse type box, turns one knob, then walks back to Steven. CABLE GUY (loud-normally) All set. STEVEN So what's with the cut cord? CABLE GUY (nonchalantly) That's for effect. See ya' tomorrow Steven. (conspiratorially) She's pretty. And don't kiss her. Don't even touch her. Fight the urge at all costs. It will pay off later with... He makes a motion which implies sex. CABLE GUY Enjoy the flick. The Cable Guy walks away. Steven walks back inside. ROBIN Who was that? STEVEN Nobody. Steven sits down next to Robin. Robin moves next to him. Steven looks very happy. 28",

The entire restaurant/arena is designed in Medieval themed decor. All of the staff are dressed as knights, sorcerers, royalty, etc. (Revision Ends - Pink) STEVEN Funny. I never thought I would ever come here. CABLE GUY I love this place. I come here twice a week. A Hispanic woman with a large butt walks by. The Cable Guy is transfixed. CABLE GUY Oh man, that's my look. I love big butts. Ow, that hurts. He grabs his crotch and squeezes, as if it's the only way he can control himself. CABLE GUY There oughta be a law. Man she is hot. It's just not fair. STEVEN (gestures to him squeezing his crotch) Please don't. CABLE GUY You know what I need right now? Pooooon tang. And I'm not talking about the place in Vietnam. STEVEN Good to know. They sit down. The WAITRESS walks over. She is dressed in peroid clothes, but is not enthusiastic about her job. WAITRESS (flatly) Welcome to Medieval Times. My name is Melinda. I'll be your serving wench. May I get you something from the bar keep? CABLE GUY (too into it) Dost thou have a mug of ale for me and me mate? He has been pitched in battle for a fortnight an has a King's thirst for the beer thust thou might have for thust. WAITRESS (uninspired) I'll be right back my lord. The Cable Guy puts something together. CABLE GUY There you go. He hands Steven a paper crown. They both put theirs on. STEVEN Thanks for the help. The Cable Guy sees something. His eyes widen. CABLE GUY Steven, don't turn around, but there is a woman eyeing you like you are a piece of meat and she hasn't eaten in a week. Steven acts like he isn't interested, but he is. STEVEN Really? What does she look like? CABLE GUY Shoe's a hottie. I wish she was checking me out. Man -- she is on fire! Total robo-babe. STEVEN Are you serious? CABLE GUY Don't look. STEVEN I've got to look. CABLE GUY Okay, but play it cool. Just turn like you are looking for the waitress. Steven puts up his hand, and turns as if he's going to call for the waitress. He sees the woman. She is in her sixties, and probably wasn't attractive at any stage of her life. Steven turns back to the cable Guy, annoyed. CABLE GUY Ha-ha. I'm just messing with your mind. But you fell for it man. You are one horny Indian Chief. STEVEN (not laughing) You got me. CABLE GUY So what did you want to rap about? The trumpets go off, the lights go down and the show begins. CABLE GUY Hold that thought. Show's on. The Cable Guy turns and looks at a stage that stands at one end above the arena. 32",

ON STEVEN AND THE CABLE GUY - They are eating whole chickens with their bare hands while watching the show. STEVEN (to the Watiress) Could I get a knife and fork? WAITRESS There were no utensils in Medieval Times, so there are no utensils at 'Medieval Times.' Do you want a refill on that Pepsi? STEVEN There were no utensils, but there was Pepsi? WAITRESS Look, I have a lot of tables to get to. The waitress exits. CABLE GUY (stands up - yells to the competitors) Spill his blood! Take his kead! Show no mercy! The two knights fight with swords. After a few moments of battle the Red Knight wins. The crowd erupts. The Cable Guy goes crazy. CABLE GUY (to Steven) Come on, get into it, we won! Releuctantly, Steven stands up and applauds. STEVEN (halfheartedly) Way to go Red Knight. Good job of killing. Good work. Steven and the Cable Guy sit down. CABLE GUY So, what were you saying before? STEVEN (tentatively) How do I put this? I've really enjoyed hanging out with you, but... CABLE GUY That's why I became a cable guy. To make friends like you. Every time I walk up to a new door, that door is a possibility for friendship. When I walked in your apartment I knew there was something there. I just knew it. STEVEN (sotto) Oh lord. (tries to get back on track) I want you to know -- The lights change. Trumpets play a fanfare. The host walks out onto the stage, interrupting Steven. HOST We have reached the climax of our competition good people! Now, two noble men from our audience will battle to the death to resolve a grievance. Will a Master... (looks at his clipboard) Steven M. Bartowsky and Lord Ernie Douglas make you way to the fighting pit! A spotlight shines on them. Steven is shocked. STEVEN What's going on? CABLE GUY We're going to do battle. It'll be fun. STEVEN Is this a normal part of the show? CABLE GUY No, but I give all the Knights free cable. They said it would be cool if we just went at it for a little while. Two PIMPLY FACED SERFS from the show come and lead them away. STEVEN Is this safe? CABLE GUY That's what the armor's for. 34",

We've got to be careful we don't hurt each other. The Cable Guy doesn't answer him. He has his game face on. CABLE GUY I cannot listen to any of your instructions for you are my sworn enemy, and are about to meet your demise. Before Steven can answer him the trumpets blare. HOST Let the battle begin. Come now people, let me hear your voices! The crowd cheers. Music plays. The serfs hand them each a sword and shield, then walk them to the center of the pit. The Cable Guy crouches in a war-like position. He begins to circle Steven like a cat. Steven mirrors him, not sure of what to do. STEVEN Just take it easy. The Cable Guy runs at Steven, and swings his sword. In fear, Steven puts his shield over his head. The sword smashes into it sending sparks into the air. The Cable Guy darts toward Steven and pokes him several times with his sword. Each time Steven blocks it with either his sword or his shield. STEVEN (enraged) What are you doing?! CABLE GUY (matter of fact) I'm trying to kill you. The Cable Guy grabs a mace (a stick with a chain and ball attached to it) off of a weapon filled wall and runs at Steven, swinging with abandon. Steven blocks the deadly mace with his shield. STEVEN Hey, watch it! The Cable Guy leaps onto Steven. Then he speaks into his ear as he pushes him down onto the ground. CABLE GUY This is just like when Spock had to fight Kirk on 'Star Trek.' Best friends forced to do battle. Steven gets angry and pushes the Cable Guy off of him. He swings at the Cable Guy with his sword, just missing him. The Cable Guy rolls on the ground and pops back up in the air. CABLE GUY That's the spirit. Let's give 'em a good show. Steven charges at the Cable Guy, swinging wildly. It is a real battle now. He bangs away at the Cable Guy's mace until he knocks it out of his hands. The Cable Guy runs backwards, then falls on the ground. By the look in his eyes we can tell that the Cable Guy's feelings are hurt. CABLE GUY So that's how it's gonna be, huh? All right. If you want to play rought, Daddy can play rough. The Cable Guy charges at Steven with his shield. He upper cuts the shield to Steven's face, sending him to the ground. The Cable Guy runs to the wall and grabs a huge battle ax, a four foot long stick with a fancy silver blade on the end of it. He swings it in circles like a Japanese master. Steven grabs a similar weapon, and then begin to circle each other. STEVEN Chip, this isn't funny! Will you stop it! CABLE GUY The name is Spock. If we don't battle to the death, they'll kill us both. Good-bye Jim. He swings his sword, and they battle 'Star Trek' style. The Cable Guy begins to sing the \"Star Trek Battle Music\" as they fight. STEVEN This isn't 'Star Trek!' MUSIC UP: STAR TREK BATTLE MUSIC They bang the handles of their battle axes together, jockeying for position. The Cable Guy pushes Steven away from him, then takes a huge swing, but Steven leaps in the air over the blade. The Cable Guy swings over his head, and Steven blocks it with his ax handle. They continue to swing and roll in a vicious battle. Then the Cable Guy takes a swing which Steven is unable to block. The battle ax cuts through part of Steven's protection. STEVEN (looking down) Jesus. The Cable Guy runs to a horses' entrance. There is a long pause, and then we hear the sound of pounding horse hooves. A moment later the Cable Guy rides out on a horse holding a jousting stick. The show's host runs up to Steven. HOST Quickly, muster a top your steed. (Steven doesn't move - the host drops character) Get on the god damn horse! I don't think he's kidding! Left with no choice, Steven jumps on a horse and grabs a joust. The host smacks Steven's horse sending it straight toward the charging Cable Guy. STEVEN Don't do this! CABLE GUY Jim, we have no choice! STEVEN Oh my god. They run toward each other. A horrible game of chicken. Neither gives in. When they reach one another Steven knocks the Cable Guy off his horse with his jousting stick. The Cable Guy flies through the air, lands on his back. Steven rides to him. Jumps off his horse, throws off his helmet. STEVEN (concerned) Are you okay? The Cable Guy sits up and smile at him. CABLE GUY Well done good sir. You are the victor, but we shall meet again. The two serfs put Steven on a chair connected to two poles. They carry him to the center of the arena in victory. The crowd cheers wildly. Steven feels the adrenaline rush. He holds up his arms in triumph, and smiles. DISSOLVE TO LATER: 35",

(Revised 11/13/95 - Blue) STEVEN You're probably right. CABLE GUY Damn right I'm right. STEVEN Oh, I got you a little something. He hands a box to the Cable Guy. CABLE GUY I thought you said we were even. You're breaking the rules. STEVEN So shoot me. He opens it. The box says, \"Lose Your Lisp in Thirty Days.\" The Cable Guy is so moved he cannot speak. STEVEN My brother said it might help with your lisp. The Cable Guy looks Steven in the eye for a long beat, then hugs him hard. CABLE GUY Words cannot express... (he is too moved to finish his sentence) STEVEN It's no big deal. CABLE GUY Yes it is. He stares at Steven until it makes him uncomfortable. CABLE GUY Now I'm on a mission. This has got to be the best party ever! Let's rock. 37B",

He quickly turns back. CABLE GUY Did it just get hotter in here? (grabs his crotch) Oh, that hurts. STEVEN Who'd she come with? CABLE GUY I don't know, but she looks pretty available to me. I'd strike while the iron is hot. He who hesitates, masturbates, know what I'm saying? ANGLE ON A nerdy, balding man walks over to Rick. ODD MAN He sure can throw a party. Chip's an incredible man.

You've got to learn to live with that. RICK I don't know what your story is \"Chip Douglas,\" but I'm going to find out. CABLE GUY Oooh. How dramatic. The song ends. Rick walks away. He waves to Steven as he heads out. Steven runs over to him. RICK I'm getting out of here. STEVEN (drunk) Why? This is a great party. This girl is really into me. RICK You're whacked man. That guy is bad news. STEVEN You don't even know him. You're just mad 'cause he kicked your ass in basketball. RICK I can't even deal. I'm outta here. ON THE CABLE GUY - At the karaoke area. He speaks into the microphone. CABLE GUY Hello everyone. First of all I'd like to thank Steven for being such a terific host. Steven smiles, and does a half wave to everyone as they applaud. CABLE GUY Don't forget to kick in some spinach for the beer. Steven ain't made of money. And I expect some of you to join in the clean up crew. OFF DUTY COP Sing something! Do a song! CABLE GUY (false coyness) No... I really couldn't. ODD MAN Come on! Do your song! CABLE GUY Okay, just to stop that guy from begging. This number is dedicated to all of the ladies in the house. He puts on a Janet Jackson type microphone, then breaks into a fast paced rap of the song \"Bust A Move,\" accompanied by elaborate dance moves. CABLE GUY (rapping) (Lyrics to \"Bust A Move.\") During the musical break the Cable Guy begins to break dance. He knows all the moves. The robot, the spider, the crab. He looks like a deranged cast member or \"Electric Boogaloo.\" The guests go crazy. ANGLE ON STEVEN AND HEATHER STEVEN You sounded just like Olivia Newton John. HEATHER I've been practicing for years. STEVEN (laughs) So what do you do? HEATHER I can barely hear you. Do you want to talk in the other room? STEVEN Oh... okay. They walk into Steven's bedroom.

That was just what I needed. (Revision Ends - Blue) CABLE GUY You look like a new man. STEVEN I feel like a new man. I was getting so used to being rejected. I really liked her.

CABLE GUY You know, the women. STEVEN You mean Heather is a prostitute? CABLE GUY Of course she is. Do you think a woman like that would hang out with us if we weren't paying? Don't tell me you didn't know. STEVEN I can't believe this. He sits in a chair, and leans over in pain. CABLE GUY She's clean I assure you. I tried her out last week to make sure she was top quality, and I'm as healthy as a horse. Not a drip. She's the best, ask any of my friends. Steven cringes. STEVE You've got to be kidding? Please tell me she's a friend of yours. You're just playing with my mind again, right? CABLE GUY I wish I had friends like that. STEVEN Get out of my house! CABLE GUY Don't be ashamed of yourself. I know she was a working girl, but she kind of liked you. You might have been able to get a freebie. STEVEN Out, now! I don't ever want to see you again. (to himself) Robin is never going to forgive me. CABLE GUY I'll tell you how to handle that. Don't tell her. You want to get her back, I'll help you get her back. STEVEN I don't want your help. I want you to leave. (gestures to the TV) And take that stuff out of here. CABLE GUY (calmly) Whatever. I can take a hint. I'll see ya'. The Cable Guy exits. 42",

A DISTINGUISHED MAN walks over and washes his hands. MAN (to Cable guy) Towel please. CABLE GUY My pleasure. The man puts out his hand to take the paper towel, but the Cable Guy doesn't hand it to him, he grabs the man's hands and surrounds them with several paper towels, and begins drying them furiously. When he's done, he takes a beat and wipes them over and over, just to make sure they're dry. The man is aghast. CABLE GUY Enjoy your meal The man exits. Ray walks toward the stalls. CABLE GUY Good evening sir. Pleasant night, isn't it? RAY (curt) Yeah. CABLE GUY But I guess the weather's always pleasant in here. The winters are remarkably mild. He laughs at his own joke. Ray walks into the handicapped stall. CABLE GUY (OS) If you need anything, just let me know. Anything at all. RAY (getting annoyed) I think I can handle it. Ray unzips his fly, and prepares to pee standing up. Suddenly, as if out of thin air, the Cable Guy is standing right behind him. He speaks into Ray's ear, startling him. CABLE GUY I'm here to serve you. RAY Jesus! Get out of here! CABLE GUY Most people never bother to take advantage of all my services, for instance The Cable Guy grabs the back of Ray's shirt, kicks his feet out from under him, and slams his face into the toilet bowl, sloshing it around. Ray struggles, but the Cable Guy is too strong. CABLE GUY I can help you wash up. Cleanliness is so very important. He pulls his face out. CABLE GUY Then once you're done I have a variety of skin care products which can make you look years younger. The Cable Guy kicks the door open, and pulls Ray toward the counter. He grabs a bottle of lotion. CABLE GUY This lotion is superb at removing liver spots. He slaps it onto Ray's face. CABLE GUY This one is an excellent moisturizer. The Cable Guy pours some after cologne into his hands, and rubs his hands together as if he's about to put it on Ray's face. CABLE GUY And one can never underestimate the effects of a good cologne. The Cable Guy rears back and slaps Ray across the face. CABLE GUY (sniffs) Mm... High Karate. And now a touch of powder. He takes a large powder puff, and smashes it into Ray's face temporarily blinding him. CABLE GUY (grabs a tweezer) Ooh, I almost forget, it's oh so very important to be properly tweezed. The Cable Guy plucks several hairs out from between Ray's eyebrows. CABLE GUY You're on a big date, you'll need fresh breath. He takes a clear jar of combs, and pours the blue fluid and the combs into Ray's mouth. CABLE GUY Whoops, that's not mouth wash. But that reminds me. Proper hair care is a must. The Cable Guy combs his soaking wet hair into a very goofy looking side part. CABLE GUY Looking good, now let's dry you off. He runs Ray face first into the starting button of an automatic hand dryer. It turns on. The Cable Guy puts his face right up next to the air. CABLE GUY Now suck it. Suck the air! Ray hesitantly puts his mouth around the nozzle, and his cheeks start fluttering like an astronaut experiencing heavy G-Force. CABLE GUY from this angle you look just like Neil Armstrong experiencing G-Force. I believe you have the \"right stuff.\" The Cable Guy pulls him away, and smashes his face into the tip basket. CABLE GUY Don't worry about the tip. But I've got one for you. (whispers into his ear) Stay away from Robin. She's taken. He tosses him out the door. 47A",

That man is devoted to you. You know I'm probably crossing a boundary telling you this, but he's really crazy about you. ROBIN Did he say that? CABLE GUY Only every five minutes. Quite frankly, I'm sick of hearing it. No, I'm just kidding with you. (looks her deeply in the eyes) He's a good man. He mentioned that you guys have had some problems. ROBIN Well, it's a little complicated. CABLE GUY It always is. You know I asked a woman to marry me once. She said she wanted to think about it. We agreed to take some time apart to re-assess our feelings. To give each other... (mockingly) space. (chokes up) Well, she is no longer with us. ROBIN I'm so sorry.

CABLE GUY Pretty smooth work. I set 'em up, you knock 'em down. STEVEN What? CABLE GUY Robin. I got her back for you. I juiced her up. STEVEN How do you know we're back together? CABLE GUY Free cable is the ultimate aphrodisiac. STEVEN I don't want you messing around with my life. You've caused enough trouble as it is. CABLE GUY I know. I felt bad about the other night, so I wanted to make it up to you. So what are you doing? Do you want to catch a bite? Steve looks the Cable Guy in the eye. STEVEN (sincerely yet curt) Look, I appreciate you helping me out with Robin. But you have to understand, I'm going to have to work extra hard to not screw this relationship up again. You're a great guy, but I just don't have any room in my life for a new friend. Do you understand? CABLE GUY I appreciate your honesty. You're a real straight shooter. (Revised 11/13/95 - Blue) STEVEN So, you're okay? CABLE GUY Hey, I'm a big boy. It's no big deal. Whatever. STEVEN All right... well, take care. CABLE GUY Have a good one. The Cable Guy walks away.

He speaks into a repairman's phone which is illegally hooked into the telephone pole. CABLE GUY Hey, it's Chip Douglas. ROBIN Chip Douglas? CABLE GUY Your cable guy. (Revision Ends - Blue) ROBIN (surprised to hear from him) Oh, hi. What's up? CABLE GUY I feel kind of weird calling you. It's just... I'm worried about Steven. ROBIN What is it? CABLE GUY Something isn't right. He hasn't been himself lately. Have you noticed anything? ROBIN No, things are actually going really well. CABLE GUY Good. ROBIN Should I be worried? CABLE GUY Nope. I'm probably just being a nervous nellie. Let's just keep our eyes open. ROBIN (nervous) I will. Good-bye. She hangs up, then dials Steven's number. ROBIN Steven Bartowsky please. 57B",

SALES MANAGER The response to our initial offering has been remarkable. A local investment group has decided to buy the entire complex and turn them into rentals. In retrospect I must admit we made one big mistake. Everyone hangs on his every word. SALES MANAGER We should have asked for more money. The entire room laughs. Mr. Daniels stands up. MR. DANIELS I just want to put this out there, Stevey. You did it bro. You laid your cajones, and mine, out on the table, and you slam dunked it. Way to go. (nervously jokes) Now watch, they'll kick you upstairs ahead of me. All right, in other business... As Mr. Daniels speaks, Joan tries to get Steven's attention from a crack in the door. JOAN (quietly) Pssst. Steven. Steven turns and sees her. She waves for him to come to her. He waves her off. JOAN (more urgently-quietly) I really need to speak with you. Some people are beginning to notice this exchange. STEVEN (curtly) It can wait. Right then two POLICE OFFICERS storm into the room. Joan stands behind them looking concerned. POLICE OFFICER Is there a Steven Bartowsky here? STEVEN Uh... I'm Steven Bartowsky. What's going on? POLICE OFFICER You are under arrest. MR. DANIELS On what charge? POLICE OFFICER Receipt of stolen merchandise. STEVEN What? I never POLICE OFFICER Please put our hands on the table. Steven moves a sudden move toward the Police Officer. The Officer jabs him in the ribs with his club. Steven groans, then leans over in pain. POLICE OFFICER Please follow my instructions. Hands on the table. Steven puts his hands on the table. The Officer kicks his legs apart, then frisks him in front of everyone. It is pure humiliation. POLICE OFFICER Hands behind your back. The other Officer cuffs him, then turns him around. POLICE OFFICER #2 You have the right to remain silent. Anything you say may be used against you in a court of law. You have the right to an attorney. If you cannot afford an attorney one will be provided for you. Do you understand? STEVE This is all a mistake. I didn't accept any stolen goods. Just then it hits him. He hears the Cable Guy's voice in his head. CABLE GUY (V.O.) (with echo) ...you're getting THX quality sound that would make George Lucas cream in his pants  cream in his pants. He pushes him toward the door. Steven looks at everyone's horrified faces as he is taken away. He tries to break the tension with a joke. STEVEN Hey, relax. I'm the one who's going to jail. Nobody laughs. He exits. 59",

Steven sits down and picks up the phone, excited to hear any news. STEVEN What did you hear? What did you hear? The man turns around. It is not Steven's lawyer, it is the Cable Guy dressed in an expensive suit. CABLE GUY Hello Steven. I came as soon as I heard. Steven's head sinks. STEVEN Who are you?! What's your real name?! CABLE GUY So many questions. STEVEN Why are you doing this to me? CABLE GUY I didn't do this to you, you did this to you. You need to learn who your friends are. STEVEN You set me up. CABLE GUY I taught you a lesson. I can be your best friend, or your worst enemy. I hope you'll choose the latter... I mean, the former. You know what I mean. STEVEN I'll never be your friend. You need help. The Cable Guy absorbs the blow, then goes on the offensive. CABLE GUY Right now I think you're the one who needs help. I'm here to give you comfort. The Cable Guy huts his hand up to the glass. CABLE GUY Come on, touch it. Steven just stares at him. CABLE GUY Come on. You need human contact. Touch it. STEVEN I will not touch it. The Cable Guy stands up, and begins unbuttoning his shirt. STEVEN What are you doing? Stop it. Steven looks around frantically. CABLE GUY I know how you're feeling right now. The Cable Guy pushes his naked breast against the glass. Other prisoners are beginning to stare. STEVEN (smacking the glass) Stop it! Stop it! CABLE GUY I'm here for you. STEVEN (smacks the glass three times) Get off there! Are you trying to get me killed? The Cable Guy begins to laugh. CABLE GUY (as he buttons his shirt) I was just messing with your mind. That was from 'Midnight Express.' Awesome film. Oliver Stone won the Academy Award for the screenplay. STEVEN Guard! Guard! CABLE GUY Don't you worry about Robin, I'll make sure she's well taken care of. STEVEN You go near her, I'll kill you. Steven lunges at the glass. Steven's guard pulls Steven out of the room toward the exit. STEVEN Hey, this is the guy who framed me! The Cable Guy walks to his door. He turns to the guard at the door. CABLE GUY (warmly) Louis, how'd you like that Tyson fight on Pay Per View? I told you it's more fun when it's Free Per View. They both laugh. The door closes behind them. 65",

Robin is brought over to the table by a hostess. The Cable Guy takes off his Walkman, and stands up to be polite. He sits down in perfect synch with her. ROBIN Hello. CABLE GUY Hello. I'm sorry we have to meet under these circumstances. ROBIN Me too. Believe me. CABLE GUY I know we don't know each other very well, but we do have one thing in common, our concern for Steven. ROBIN Well, you were right. Something's happening with him and he won't even acknowledge it. CABLE GUY If he refuses to admit he has a problem, we may have to let him hit bottom. He's gonna need some tough love. ROBIN (tentatively) You know his lawyer said that nobody named Ernie Douglas works for the Cable Company. CABLE GUY (chuckles) Did he do a name search? 'Cause I work under a pseudonym so the customers won't harass me at home. Kind of like a stripper. My real name is Larry, Larry Tate. ROBIN And he's saying he received all the stereo equipment from you. CABLE GUY (I know, and I'm not mad. He's been cornered, so he's telling some wives tales. He doesn't mean to hurt me. ROBIN I just feel like I triggered this with him. It's not that I don't want to get married, it's just I felt like he wanted to get married just to get married. I don't deal well with pressure. CABLE GUY Hey, welcome to the human race. We're not perfect. We all think we have to look like a 'Baywatch' babe and be as witty as 'Seinfeld.' Give yourself a break. ROBIN God I could go for turkey and mashed potatoes now. CABLE GUY Comfort food. Bring it on. ROBIN Exactly. She laughs. CABLE GUY You've got a great laugh. Can I make a small request? I'd like to hear it a little more often. She blushes. 66",

BARRY NOLAN The Sam Sweet trial has been thrown into chaos as a result of a videotape made a month after the killing. In this \"Hard Copy\" exclusive an apparently intoxicated Sam Sweet puts on a macabre show for his friends at a party. The judge has not decided whether this tape is admissible as evidence. We see a videotape of Sam Sweet at a party. The date and time are seen in the corner. Sam stands next to the corner of a wall which is completely covered with a mirror. Sam gestures with a beer bottle as he looks at his reflection in the mirror. SAM SWEET (to camera) Hey everyone. Look it's me and... (gestures to his reflection) my brother Stan. (waves at reflection) Hi Stan. It's so nice to see you. How are you feeling? (to camera) Look, he's alive. Sam punches the mirror, shattering it. SAM SWEET (angry) Now he's dead. Realizing he's revealed too much, he forces a smile. SAM SWEET What? I'm just goofing around. We pull back and reveal a group of police officers watching this on television. We pan over to Steven's father EARL paying bail. STEVEN I'm sorry dad. EARL I don't want to hear it. Do you know the pain you out your mother through? You're lucky she didn't die of a heart attack. STEVEN I didn't do anything. EARL Just like you said you didn't steal that 'X-Men' comic book when you were eight. Then I found it in your underwear drawer. STEVEN Will you ever stop mentioning that? EARL This cost me a lot of money. You jump bail, and I swear I'll hire a bounty hunter to hunt you down. 67",

ROBIN At lunch the other day. STEVEN At lunch? You had lunch with him? The Cable Guy walks over. ROBIN Hello. You look great. She gives him a peck on the cheek. Steven winces. CABLE GUY And you are a vision. Hello Steven. You're looking rested. STEVEN Come here. He pulls the Cable Guy aside. CABLE GUY Steven, what's with you tonight? I'm getting some really weird energy from you. STEVEN Maybe it's because I just got out of prison, where you sent me. I should just drag you to the police right now. CABLE GUY You can if you like, but I'd hate to have to show Robin this. He takes out a Polaroid of Steven kissing the hooker. STEVEN You son of a bitch. The Cable Gut quickly puts it away. CABLE GUY Come on Steven, let's just have a good time tonight. (Revised 11/13/95 - Blue) Robin, Earl and Steven's mother walk over. EARL Steven, your mother and I had a long talk with your friend Larry here when he came over to screw in the cable. STEVEN'S MOTHER (to the Cable Guy) Thank you again for that. EARL (beat) We owe you an apology. I didn't realize the seriousness of your problems. You're obviously going through some kind of personal hell and I need to be more understanding. We didn't get involved with things like that when I was your age. Steven cannot figure out what kind of lie the Cable Guy has told them. EARL I know we haven't been there for you lately but we're going to see you through this, 'cause we are a family. I love you. He gives him a big hug. Steven grimaces. STEVEN'S MOTHER You've got a good friend here. They walk into the next room where the entire family is gathered for pre-dinner cocktails. Steven's brother PETE walks over to Steven. He carries a baby in a pouch. PETE (winks) Hey buddy, we're with you. Keep your chin up. 71",

CABLE GUY So Steven is carrying this battle ax, and he's chasing me, swinging like a mad man. I'm yelling at him, 'hey, it's just a show!' (Revision Ends - Blue) STEVEN'S SISTER He always takes things too seriously. CABLE GUY Tell me something I don't know. This guy almost took my head off. Everybody laughs. The camera moves to Steven. He stares at the Cable Guy, his eyes filled with rage. STEVEN'S P.O.V. The Cable Guy is talking and eating in SLOW-MOTION. ON STEVEN - watching him. He is in normal motion. ON THE CABLE GUY - eating in SLOW-MOTION ON STEVEN - getting very irritated. STEVEN What are you doing? ON THE CABLE GUY As he talks we realize he has not been in slow motion, he's just been pretending he's in slow motion. CABLE GUY It's from \"Goodfellas.\" Remember the intro scene at the bar. I'm Johnny Two Times. He moves in slow motion some more. Everyone laughs. TONY, Steven's six year old nephew, runs to the Cable Guy with a toy gun. TONY/CABLE GUY Pow, pow, pow. You're under arrest. Everyone laughs. The Cable Guy starts running around the table. Tony makes chase, laughing all the way. CABLE GUY You'll never catch me copper. The Cable Guy stops, grabs a piece of asparagus and puts it between his lip and nose, and pretends it's a moustache. CABLE GUY I'm gonna wear a disguise. Steven looks at the Cable Guy and remembers something. STEVEN'S P.O.V. - He sees the Cable Guy. The artist's rendering of the man who beat up Robin's date appears in front of the Cable Guy's face. Steven realizes that they are the same person. Steven gets a frightened look on his face. The kid points his gun at the Cable Guy and yells \"pow.\" The Cable Guy drops to the floor like he's been shot. CABLE GUY Oh, you got me. The Cable Guy plays dead. The kid walks over to him. When he gets close, the Cable Guy lunges to grab him. CABLE GUY (devil voice) Aaah!!! Nobody messes with me and lives! The kid screams with laughter and runs away. The Cable Guy chases him around the table and out of the room. Steven instantly fears for Tony's safety. He follows them. 72-75",

Steven flies back, scared out of his wits. Tony and the Cable Guy start laughing hysterically. They have a grand 'ol time enjoying their little prank. CABLE GUY Oh man, you should have seen your face. It was classic. STEVEN Very funny. Tony, go to your mother! Tony immediately starts crying. He leaves. CABLE GUY Look what you've done. STEVEN I know you beat up Robin's date. The Cable Guy's laughter stops on a dime. CABLE GUY I guess I did what you didn't have the guts to do. STEVEN You stay away from Robin. CABLE GUY (disturbed) Don't mess with me. I'm feeling like a part of the family, and I like it. You should try it sometime. Steven's mother enters. STEVEN'S MOTHER (looks at them) My, you two look like brothers. Come on back, we're all having coffee in the living room. Cable Guy quickly starts walking back to the dining room. CABLE GUY (happily) Are you guys trying to fatten me up? 'Cause if you are, you're doing a damn good job of it. He laughs, and exits. Steven slowly follows. 76-78 OMITTED 79        INT. LIVING AREA - LATER Everyone is sitting around having coffee. The Cable Guy is writing words on torn up pieces of paper. CABLE GUY You guys have never played \"Porno Password?\" EARL No, but I like the sound of it. CABLE GUY It's the adult version of the popular television game show. Robin you're on my team. Steven, you're with mom. (to everyone else) You're the audience. The Cable Guy sits next to Robin. Steven and his mother sit across from them. The Cable Guy looks at the word, then shows it to the family so none of the contestants can see it. He whispers it in Steven's ear. CABLE GUY (whispers) The password is... vagina. Steven winces. STEVEN I really don't want to play this game. (looks to his mother) Woman. Woman. STEVEN'S MOTHER Uh... man? STEVEN No. CABLE GUY (to Robin) Pe-nis. Pe-nis. Pe-nis. Robin concentrates hard, but she can't figure it out. CABLE GUY Peeee-nis. Peeee-nis. ROBIN Vagina? CABLE GUY (pumps his fist) Yes! He high fives Robin. Everyone laughs. EARL (blurts out) I thought it was going to be schlong! (covers his mouth - embarrassed) Whoops. Everyone laughs. They are all having a great time, except Steven. The Cable Guy looks at the next word, shows it to the family privately, then whipsers to Steven. CABLE GUY The password is... nipple. STEVEN Can I pass? EARL Come on Steven, don't be a stick in the mud. STEVEN Breast. Breast. STEVEN'S MOTHER Tit? Everyone laughs. Steven's face is red. CABLE GUY Hard... (gestures like there is another word after it) Hard... ROBIN Erection? Everyone laughs. Steven looks like he might kill the Cable Guy. STEVEN Center. Center. STEVEN'S MOTHER Nipple? Everyone cheers. STEVEN'S MOTHER I can't believe I got it. I was going to say areola. Everyone laughs except Steven, who is mortified. CABLE GUY I wish you did, 'cause we'd be ahead. The Cable Guy shows the word to everyone, then whispers in Steven's ear. CABLE GUY The password is... I'm not sure how to pronounce this, it's either clitoris, or clit-oris. STEVEN (snaps) I can't say that to my mother! EARL Hey, she's a grown woman. She can handle it. ROBIN Come on Steven. We're just having fun. STEVEN No, I've had enough. I can't do this. This guy is ruining my life, I won't sit here and play X-rated party games with him. EARL Steven, I really think you're over- reacting. STEVEN I am not over-reacting. You're all being fooled by this guy! He's a felon for Christ sake! (to the Cable Guy) I hate you! Get out of my life! CABLE GUY I'm sorry everyone. If I am a nuisance, I will leave. I would never stay where I am not wanted. ROBIN (to the Cable Guy) You're not a nuisance. Please don't go. (to Steven) Steven, you're being an asshole. EARL Yeah, Steven it seems like you're the one with the problem. STEVEN What? You have no idea what this guy is really like. CABLE GUY I'll just go. STEVEN See what I mean! CABLE GUY Steven, what's with you tonight? (gets close to Steven and whispers) Robin showed me that birthmark on her left shoulder. It's very sexy. Steven punches the Cable Guy in the facem sending him to the floor. All of the women, including Robin run to help him. ROBIN (to Steven) I can't believe you. The Cable Guy gets up. CABLE GUY I'm fine. Thank you for a delightful evening. (to Steven) I forgive you. He exits. Everyone looks at Steven like he is the devil. STEVEN You don't understand. Everyone walks away from Steven. The party is over. 80",

He invited this woman to my party and didn't tell me she was a prostitute. I'm so glad we can talk about this. ROBIN When did you have a party? STEVEN When we weren't communicating. I invited you. You were out on a date. ROBIN And you were with a prostitute. STEVEN She seduced me. That's what they do. They're professionals. And I didn't even know she was a prostitute.

Then another, and another. Soon he is surrounded by screaming car alarms, and flashing headlights. He looks around in fear. STEVEN Chip! Chip, this isn't funny! Where are you?!!! Suddenly they all stop simultaneously, and then the only sound is a miniacle laugh echoing through the garage. Steven runs to his car, and gets in. He drives up the ramp in a panic. From out of nowhere the Cable Guy steps into the beam of his headlights. He cannot stop in time. The Cable Guy is thrown into the air, then lands on the back of the roof of the car. Before he falls off he grabs on to the bar of the luggage rack. Steven looks through his rear view window and sees the Cable Guy staring at him. As Steven continues to drive the Cable Guy climbs on to the roof of the car, then jumps on the hood, and stares at Steven through the windshield. Steven swerves around, almost losing control of the car. STEVEN Leave me alone! I have no job, no girlfriend, no family anymore! It's over! You won! (Revised 11/13/95 - Blue) CABLE GUY (menacingly) Oh no. It's not over. It's just gettin' started. He turns a corner very sharply throwing the Cable Guy off his car. The Cable Guy falls to the ground, rolling many times, then leaps to his feet using the momentum of the roll, and runs off, scampering like a supernatural bug. 83-94",

One is eleven years old, and the last one is in a wheelchair. RICK So we're nowhere. Ernie Douglas? Ernie Douglas? She begins tapping her foot nervously. RICK Could you stop that? RESEARCHER Don't snap at me. I'm doing this as a favor. He continues staring at her two-tone wing tipped style shoe. RICK (has an epiphany) Wait, could you start that again?

So very close. The camera rotates and reveals that the Cable Guy is actually lying down. Then the camera rises up and reveals that the Cable Guy is lying in the floorboards right underneath Steven. A single beam of light shines across his face. As he speaks a large daddy long legs spider crawls across his face. He never acknowledges it. CABLE GUY You know, I don't think you're right for Robin. She needs someone who can be sensitive to her needs. Someone who understands her soul. STEVEN You stay away from her. CABLE GUY Aren't we the control freak. Looks like you're starting to sweat. STEVEN I got the camera. You can't see me. Steven begins to pick his face. CABLE GUY Oh yeah? Then why are you picking your face? Steven throws the phone. When it lands we see the speaker phone light is on. He begins looking for the camera. He smashes his TV. JUMP CUTS - Steven tearing through everything in his apartment. CABLE GUY You're getting closer. Steven overturns a CD rack. CABLE GUY Pity, such a nice CD rack. You know sometimes the answer is right under your nose. Steven lloks at the floorboards, then runs out of the room, and returns a moment later with an ax. He starts chopping at the floorboards, tearing the out. He looks down into the hole, he sees nothing. Then a hand grabs him by the shirt and pulls his face into the space in the floor. The Cable Guy's face appears in front of him, screaming like a mad man. He licks Steven's face quickly, then disappears back into the hole. Steven falls back. He hears the Cable Guy scuttle away. Steven sticks his head back down into the hole only to see the dust in the floorboards swirl in the aftermath of the Cable Guy's exit. He hears the Cable Guy crawling through the walls above him, then through the side walls, and away into the distance. When it clears he discovers a small makeshift observation room has been set up in the crawlspace. There are a few photos pasted to the floorboards. One shows the Cable Guy as a child standing next to his mother. Steven's picture has been pasted into those photos making him look like the Cable Guy's brother. The only other photo is of Jerry Springer. Steven sees a small television monitor and a set of headphones from which the Cable Guy has been watching him. He looks at a cellular phone. Every speed dial on the back of the phone says \"Steven\" next to it. Steven gets up, and runs out of his front door. 108A",

Apparently she was some phone sex pioneer. STEVEN No way. RICK And get this, he was discharged from the Marines. He got mad at his Sergeant so he sent a weapons silo to Defcon Two using a Radio Shack computer. And that's not the half of it. As Rick gets closer Steven steps forward out of the shadows, and we reveal that it is not Steven, but the Cable Guy, dressed like Steven, doing a perfect impression (actually the real voice of Steven looped into the Cable Guy's mouth - with a very slight lisp). CABLE GUY Really? Tell me more. Rick's face turns white. He stumbles backwards, trying to get away. CABLE GUY I'm very interested in learning everything I can about that wacked out cable installer. He turns and runs. He is fifteen feet away from the Cable Guy. The camera pushes in on the Cable Guy. He pulls out a staple gun, and fires. We hear but do not see Rick yelp, and fall.

He gets out of the car, and begins walking to the satellite dish which is surrounded by a chain link fence. He hears the sounds of horse hooves coming closer, and closer. The  he sees a headless man on a horse ride straight toward the fence. The horse has the coat of arms from Medieval Times. When he reaches it he smashes off the chain with a sword, then rides through. The horse rears back on its hind legs. The horse runs full speed directly at Steven. At the last possible moment the horse jumps over Steven. When the horse stops, the Cable Guy pops his head through the top of his coat. CABLE GUY (chuckles) Ichabod Crane! The Disney Channel showed it all last month. The Cable Guy rides toward him again. CABLE GUY (like the Vegas announcer) Let's get ready to ruuuuuummmmbbble!!!! (Revision Ends - Blue) This time when he gets near Steven, he leaps off the horse, onto him. They both slam into a puddle of mud. The Cable Guy punches him in the stomach, and then the face. STEVEN Where's Robin?! CABLE GUY This isn't about Robin, this is about you and me. Steven charges directly at the Cable Guy. STEVEN Where's Robin?!!! Steven tackles him to the ground, and begins hitting him. They are both covered in mud like warriors from the rain forest. Steven grabs a large rock and holds it over his head. STEVEN Tell me! CABLE GUY (nonchalantly) I'm sorry, I didn't catch the question? Steven brings down the rock. At the last moment the Cable Guy moves his head. The rock slams into the ground. CABLE GUY Steven you've changed. (beat - then impressed) I like it. The Cable Guy convulses his body, pushing Steven off him. They wrestle on the ground. The Cable Guy gets on top of Steven, then pulls a power drill out of his belt and turns it on. CABLE GUY I think it's time to make you cable ready. He slowly brings the drill down to Steven. Steven blindly reaches behind him. He grasps a large branch and bats the Cable Guy off him. The Cable Guy grabs a large tree brance and runs towards Steven. They begin fighting in a fashion which mirrors their Medieval Times swordfight. CABLE GUY Last time we fought I let you win! Best two out of three! MUSIC UP: Ominous version of the 'Star Trek' battle music. CABLE GUY (crazed) You treat me like the TV! You use me, but you can't live without me! The Cable Guy smashes Steven in the knee with his branch. CABLE GUY You can't shut me off with your remote control!!!! I'm not like Robin and Rick and Mommy and Daddy and brother and sister and cousin -- Steven smashes him in the head with the branch. STEVEN I got the point. The Cable Guy goes down. He appears to be unconscious. ROBIN (in the distance) Steven. He looks to the dish, but cannot see her. 123",

Three wires go from the points on the edge of the dish, and meet at a point at the center of the satellite, thirty feet above the floor of the dish. ROBIN is hanging by her bound hands from the center of where those wires meet. Steven climbs down towrd the bottom of the dish. ROBIN Help me Steven! In the background we see the blurry image of the Cable Guy climbing through an entry hatch at the top of the dish. Robin's eyes fill with terror. ROBIN Steven! Look out! CABLE GUY (mimics her) Yeah Steven. Look out! The Cable Guy leaps out of the hatch like a jack-in-the-box. He slides down the dish, knocking Steven down. The two tumble down the slope of the dish, and tumble all the way down into the water. CABLE GUY (sweetly, like a girl) I've missed you. The Cable Guy immediately punches Steven, sending him back into the water. The Cable Guy dives on top of him. A moment later the Cable Guy pulls Steven up, then grabs his collar and speaks right into his face. CABLE GUY (dramatically) \"Dry land is not a myth, I've seen it.\" Kevin Costner from Waterworld. I don't know what the fuss was about, the movie ruled, I saw it six times. He pulls Steven under the water, and tries to hold him there. He pulls him up after a few moments. CABLE GUY Isn't it weird that we'vve wound up in this position? He pushes him under the water again. After a moment he pulls him back up. Steven gasps for air. CABLE GUY Who would have thunk it? Enraged, Steven punches him in the mouth with such tremendous force that it appears to have knocked his jaw out of alignment. CABLE GUY (without any lisp) You're gonna have to do better than that Steven. (realizing his lisp is gone) Steven. Hey, my lisp is gone. Steven hits him again, this time on the other side of the face. CABLE GUY (lisping again) You stupid son of a bitch. The Cable Guy falls unconscious. ROBIN Steven! Steven runs to her. 124",

CABLE GUY (laughs maniacally) I know what your saying. Who does this guy think he is, Jason? STEVEN Stay away from her! Suddenly, the Cable Guy does a front flip, and lands perfectly on the wire. CABLE GUY I saw that in Trapeze, starring Tony Curtis. He was just on \"Life-styles of the Rich and Famous.\" He still looks terrific. Steven is about ten feet from the dangling Robin, but the reverberation from the Cable Guy's landing makes Steven lose his balance. He falls over, but catches ont the wire. He is left hanging there. The Cable Guy sees this, and begins to run incredibly fast toward Robin. CABLE GUY And the race is on. He does a cartwheel on the strut, hops on one leg, then takes off toward her, running at full speed. Steven, left with no other option, simply bounces up and down on the wire. Robin sees this and joins him. The Cable Guy begins to lose his balance. CABLE GUY (knows he's about to fall) This is such an anti-climactic way to end this. The Cable Guy loses his balance and falls to the water below. The Cable Guy has surely met his demise. 125",

ROBIN I'm sorry I didn't believe you. I love you. STEVEN I love you too. You're right. We shouldn't get married. I've got a lot of problems to work out which have absolutely nothing to do with you. ROBIN We'll work them out together. They kiss. Suddenly the Cable Guy pops up from underwater. He looks frightening. Then he starts coughing uncontrollably. He looks like a small boy who has swallowed too much water. CABLE GUY (between coughs) What just happened? Where am I? (remembers) Oh yeah, I was trying to kill you. He leaps at Steven, and puts him in a head-lock. He squeezes until Steven passes out. The he lays him on the ground. CABLE GUY (to Robin) It's a sleeper hold. Hulk Hogan used it on Sly Stallone in \"Rocky Three.\" He should wake up in thirty seconds, so let's get going. He holds her around the neck, and puts a staple gun to her head, then walks her out of the dish. Steven slowly wakes up. He looks and sees the Cable Guy and Robin beginning to climb up the rdio antenna. He quickly gets up to follow them. 126 EXT. ANTENNA - NIGHT The Cable Guy and Robin climb the antenna. Steven follows them up from a distance. The Cable Guy and Robin reach a platform at the top of the antenna. The Cable Guy holds Robin with one hand, and holds a staple gun to her temple with the other hand. Steven climbs onto the platform. STEVEN Easy. He walks with Robin to the edge of the platform. There is a one-hundred foot drop to the dish below. A police helicopter hovers in the air around them. CABLE GUY It didn't have to be this way Steven. I'm just trying to show you the kind of things that can happen when you mistreat people. STEVEN Don't do anything stupid. CABLE GUY You know this is just like that secen in that Clint Eastwood movie \"Dirty Harry\" -- STEVEN (snaps) No! This is not like anything! This is not a movie! We're real people! You're hurting us! This is reality! The Cable Guy's eyes turn sad. This hits the Cable Guy like a sucker punch. Dazed, he lets go of Robin. She runs to Steven's arms. From below we hear the sound of sirens. A pack of police cars pull up and surround the antenna. The Cable Guy's expression changes. He begins to look like a scared little boy. CABLE GUY If this is reality... (he climbs onto the guard railing) ...I am outta here. The Cable Guy slowly falls backward off the antenna. STEVEN Nooo! Steven lunges for the Cable Guy, grabbing his forearm, then grabbing the antenna with the other hand. STEVEN You're not going anywhere. The Cable Guy hangs high above the satellite dish. Steven tries to pull the Cable Guy back onto the platform, but the Cable Guy does not want to be saved. STEVEN Don't do this. You just need help. We all get lonely. CABLE GUY Yeah, but I get really lonely. (beat) I mean, look at me. STEVEN You're gonna be fine. Just come on up. CABLE GUY (a long beat) Steven, I think I sat too close to the television. Mommy was right. Steven can't hold onto his forearm any longer. The Cable Guy's arm slips and Steven grabs onto his hand at the last possible second. CABLE GUY It's too late for me, but there's a lot of little Cable Boys out there who still have a chance. Say good-bye to the baby- sitter.
