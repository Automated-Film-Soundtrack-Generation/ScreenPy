JADEN'S BEDROOM - EVENING He tiptoes to the floorboards near Jaden's bed. He very cautiously levers a floorboard up. Crystals, pills, pipes, weed  but much more than before. But not what he wants to see. So Austen puts the floorboard back. He goes to the door, listens again. The shower still runs. He tiptoes back to Jaden's bed, looks around. He lifts up Jaden's pillow. THE GUN Sits there  sleek and cool and mighty and everything. Slowly, daring himself, Austen goes to TOUCH IT. His fingers linger on the smooth, cool, imperious steel. Austen is a God. 3.71 INT. E3 HOUSE  NIGHT Jaden and Lycia make love. Slow and perfectly tender, and then hard and porn. On and on. Bodies twisting in their search for each other. They come - Jaden's body arching in torment. LATER Lycia cradles his head on her breasts. His breathing is uneven, but then it evens out and slowly becomes calm. She looks at his bandaged torso. She is afraid. 49 | P a g e 3.72 EXT.

Pointless. Thug#2 stands back, waits. 58 | P a g e Uri stands, goes to a cabinet and pulls out a set of surgical implements. He puts a pair of rubber sanitary gloves on. He lays out the implements on a metal table beside Nicholas. He goes to work. 4.93 INT. ARTIST STUDIO  DAY ELLE (30's) draws a female nude in white pastel on black paper. The drawing is as exquisite as she is, if that's possible. Elle is the kind of woman that men will do anything for - the kind of unforgettable beauty you see very rarely. Elle takes extreme care with the drawing. Her attention to it and involvement with it is absolute. She is alone in the studio, which contains other drawings and simple furnature. The SOUNDS of Uri torturing Nicholas OVER are in extreme, hideous contrast to the beauty of Elle and her drawings. The contours of Elle's face and the fine lines and moments of shade in her drawing. The sounds of unimaginable suffering. Five minutes of drawing. Five minutes of Nicholas' screams. Then the SOUND of Uri dropping an implement and cursing. The Thugs mumbling. CUT TO BLACK A heart PULSE falters, and then stops. An electrocardiograph flat line SOUND. A beat, then UP ON 4.94 INT. RESEARCH ROOM, FACILITY  DAY Uri stands back. There is blood all over his rubber gloves and some on his apron. He looks at Nicholas, feels his pulse. Nicholas is dead. 4.95 INT.
