PACIFIC - NIGHT We catch glimpses of the yellow lift raft in the dark as the storm continues. EXT.  BEACH - EARLY MORNING The storm has ended.  Waves lap gently on a beach cut like a scallop out of a rocky shore.  On the beach we see scattered FEDEX BOXES.  And we see, face-down, half-buried in sand, a MAN IN A SUIT and a life jacket. Chuck. The tide gently rocks him, laps at his face.  He chokes. Slowly he gets to his knees.  Vomits seawater, big heaves. He rolls over, sits down.  Dazed.  Still confused.  Where am I?  What happened? Chuck's first instinct is to check the time.  He looks at his watch, taps it in frustration. Then he looks around, and we look with him. CHUCK'S POV - BEACH The fog has thinned.  We can see palm groves and mangrove thickets leading back into a thickly wooded valley climbing up a steep, rocky hillside.  The rocks on the opposite point end in a barren ridge.  Clouds hide the top of the hill. ON CHUCK as he takes in his surroundings.  He licks his lips.  He's thirsty.  But something he sees is even more important.  We stay with him as he WALKS.  He comes to a FEDEX PACKAGE in the sand, picks it up, brushes off the sand, walks farther. He picks up another package. EXT.  BEACH - WIDE Chuck walks down the beach, picking up FedEx packages, leaving a trail of footprints in the sand.  Ahead of him we notice a package decorated with ANGEL WINGS. EXT.  BEACH - LATER THAT MORNING Chuck has made a neat stack of FedEx boxes under some palm trees at the rim of the beach.  He examines the Angel Wing drawing with passing curiosity, then puts it on the stack. Chuck takes off his life jacket, sits down in the shade, makes himself comfortable, and waits. EXT.  BEACH - SUNSET Chuck is still waiting.  He's a systems man, and the system isn't working.",

Can't do it!  Puff.  Puff.  Shit!  John motions frantically for Chuck to pull on the automatic inflators on his jacket. Chuck fumbles for them. Huge palettes shift and groan, one BREAKS FREE, banging violently against the side of the plane, spilling out its boxes.  Then it swings and KNOCKS Chuck on the head!  He goes down! INT.

Chuck rushes about, piling on driftwood. EXT.  BEACH - CLOSER Chuck darts into the jungle and returns dragging a huge log. He throws it on the fire.  We see his face in the light of the fire.  He is exultant.  He dances.  He sings at the top of his lungs.  Papa-ooo-mow-mow! Chuck throws another huge log on the fire.  Papa-papa-papa- oooo!  The log splutters and explodes, sending up a huge shower of sparks that climb and sparkle in the darkness...until they merge with the stars. EXT.  PALM GROVE - MORNING Chuck makes a mark on the tree.  Around it he carves a flame -- the day he mastered fire. EXT.  PALM GROVE - LATER THAT MORNING Chuck sharpens his spear with his stone knife.  Then he sticks it in the flame to harden it, pulls it out, checks it, scrapes some more. EXT.  BEACH - DAY Chuck wades in the water with his spear.  Suddenly he stabs it down.  A crab is on the end. EXT.  BEACH - HALF HOUR LATER Chuck removes a crab from out of the fire and breaks a steaming crab claw.  Chuck takes a bite of the flaky white meat.  Ahhh.  It tastes great.  He takes another bite -- and flinches.",

Then, something on the island brings Chuck's eyes back from their distant focus on the horizon.  From down on the beach, beneath the palm grove, there curls a thin column of smoke. Chuck lets a bit of pride creep into his face as he sees it. He kneels down and begins to build a signal fire. EXT.  BEACH - NIGHT - LATER Chuck curls up in his bed of palm fronds.  The fire burns. Around it is a large stack of crab shells.  He stares into the fire. EXT.  PALM GROVE - MORNING Chuck makes another mark on the tree.  He has circled the tree with marks several times now. EXT.  BEACH - DAY Using a safety pin and some suturing thread, Chuck fishes carefully.  Suddenly he jerks his hand back.  On the end is a flopping fish. EXT.  PALM GROVE - DAY Chuck takes a cooked fish off the fire and mixes it with some breadfruit.  He eats the soft mixture, chewing carefully, but his tooth hurts even worse.  There are only a few Tylenol tablets left.  He carefully cuts one in half and swallows it. EXT.  SUMMIT - AFTERNOON Chuck arrives with the wood for the night.  He stares out to sea as usual, but this time he sees something different. WHALES.  He sees whales.  Leaping.  Broaching.  Spouting. Water pouring off fins and flukes.  Moving.  Going somewhere.",
