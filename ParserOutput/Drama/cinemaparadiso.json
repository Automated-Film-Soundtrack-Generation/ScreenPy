He doesn't even turn on the light, finishes getting undressed in the pale blue glow coming from the picture window. A rustling sound, a movement on the bed, the voice of a woman waking up.

SALVATORE, carried away by those faces, by the way they talk, by the beauty of the woman, slowly slips down the length of the curtain until he is sitting on the floor, his eyes glued to the screen. The love scene reaches a climax, the music crescendos, and the love-struck couple finally fall into each other's arms and kiss. Instinctively, the PRIEST raises the bell into the air, as in some age-old ceremony, and gives it a loud ring... Up in the booth ALFREDO hears the bell; it's the signal he's been waiting for. He takes a slip of paper from a pad prepared for that purpose and sticks it into the loops of the film containing that specific scene as it winds on to the reel. The projection continues... ...And also the kiss of the two actors. The PRIEST'S nervous look lingers on those black-and-white lips meeting and now pulling apart for one last declaration of love before separating. SALVATORE is wide-eyed, he's probably never seen a man and woman kiss before, it's a vision that for him has all the attraction of forbidden fruit, the horror of sin. The screen is now filled with the figure of a woman getting undressed, showing for one instant the white, voluptuous flesh of her broad, naked shoulders. SALVATORE stares in open-mouthed wonder. The PRIEST, in a fury, grabs the bell and shakes it for all he is worth. From the sound of the bell to another sound...",

Five times five equals...? COLA stops to think a moment, then... COLA Thirty! The TEACHER grabs him by the purple ear and bashes his head against the numbers on the blackboard.

The road is very wide, covered with white earth. The spring sun is dazzling. The funeral procession kicks up a cloud of dust that makes everything blurred and hazy, like a dream, rimmed around the horizon by the blue line of the sea.

He turns and looks up at the projection booth. He sees ALFREDO through the lion's mouth. ALFREDO also catches sight of him. SALVATORE gives him a timid wave of the hand, as if asking if he can come up a moment. The look on ALFREDO'S face is unmistakable, irrevocable: N0! SALVATORE'S not surprised; after what happened it won't be easy to win him over. Yet there must be some way. But what is it? As usual, SALVATORE is smart as the devil when he's out to get something.

SALVATORE, BOCCIA, PEPPINO, MASINO and COLA have taken places here and there, as nervous as everybody else. The EXAMINING BOARD MEMBER is dictating the text of the arithmetic problem. EXAMINING BOARD MEMBER A merchant owns two stores. In the first he sells fruit and vegetables. In the second he sells nails and cement... (The PRINCIPAL comes in, interrupts the dictation.) PRINCIPAL Excuse me, professor. Here are the men taking the exam for the elementary school certificate. (Turning to the door) Come in, please... (All the children turn to look. A MAN around thirty enters, ill at ease. The children recognize him and laugh mischievously. The second is the BLACKSMITH, the one who falls asleep at the movies. The third is a twenty-year-old-boy, ANGELO. The fourth is ALFREDO, embarrassed and red in the face. SALVATORE is speechless. Gives a slightly ironic laugh. There is a look of revenge in his shrewd little eyes.) Cut to: The assignment is now being carried out. There is dead silence in the hall. TEACHERS and the PRINCIPAL moue about, checking to be sure there are no notes being handed around or other forms of 'collaboration'. The four outsiders are having a hard time. It can be seen on their faces. ALFREDO is also in trouble, doesn't know how to solve the problem, the calculations are too diff cult. He looks at the desk next to him, where SALVATORE is sitting. SALVATORE is about to look up at him, but ALFREDO immediately looks away, too proud to let himself be seen. The exchange of glances continues, grotesque, almost comical. SALVATORE meanwhile writes down numbers and operations quite quickly. ALFREDO can't stand it any longer, is nervous, beaded with sweat. He's sorry he ever showed up. SALVATORE laughs up his sleeve, now he has the upper hand. ALFREDO tries sneaking a look at his exercise book in order to copy something. But SALVATORE turns his back, hiding it from sight. ALFREDO tries sneaking a look at somebody else's exercise book, but the damn kid also covers it. It looks like a conspiracy against him. ALFREDO has no way out. He has to accept the idea of eating humble pie. He looks at SALVATORE, motions him with his eyes in a conversation of glances. He asks for help, but SALVATORE stands firm, implacable. ALFREDO tries to put it into words in a low voice.",

It's pure blackmail. He rubs his hand over his sweating face, raises his eyes to the ceiling as if he were swearing. Then he surrenders, accepts the condition. SALVATORE is serious, does not flaunt his victory, but you can tell he is happy. He takes out a sheet of paper he had already prepared, with the solution to the problem, rolls it up into a tiny ball and as soon as the TEACHER passes by, takes aim and flicks it to him. ALFREDO'S hand catches the precious and dearly bought message in mid-air. Their quarrel is over.",

They look like old friends. On the sound monitor, the strains of some American musical comedy tune. SALVATORE Will they really find work in Germany? ALFREDO Who knows?...It's like an adventure. (In a theatrical voice) Hope springs eternal... (PEPPINO from the distance gives one last wave at the window of the projection booth. SALVATORE waves back.) SALVATORE Peppinoooo! Come back sooon!! (The black car drives off, leaving a cloud of dust that envelops the suppressed sobs of the grandparents standing there waving handkerchiefs. SALVATORE watches the car drive off. He mumbles:) Good thing Germany's closer than Russia. ALFREDO rubs his hand through his hair.",

The sea of heads sways and shakes at the irresistible jokes of Toto. Some people have climbed up on the window-sills. The aisles are crammed, an the way down to the screen, where grown-ups and children sit on the floor, their noses in the air. Some people munch crusts of bread they've brought along from home. Almost everybody is smoking. A woman laughs, holding the baby she is nursing. In one corner, at the end of one of the aisles jammed with people standing, a girl laughs, but every now and then her expression reveals a look of deep pleasure. Her body moves slightly. Clinging to her from the rear is a man bathed in sweat. They are making love standing there among the crowd, which notices nothing and goes on laughing. In the balcony ANGELO is holding hands with ROSA. The curtain over the entrance is open. People are also standing there, seeing what they can from the distance, even a corner of the screen through the forest of heads. But the line continues on outside...All the way to the entrance of the movie house, out in the square. There are crowds of people, shivering from the cold, who protest, shove, risk provoking incidents. The PRIEST, Father Adelfio, is exhausted, tries to calm them down.",

Pricks up his ears. It's a sort of moan - he can't figure out if it's an animal or a man. He turns on the flashlight he has brought along. Takes a closer look around. Catches sight of a bicycle wheel on the ground behind a bush. That's where the moan is coming from! He creeps over in alarm. Next to the bicycle he now catches sight of the sack with the film. And the moaning gets louder. SALVATORE (Alarmed) Boccia, what's wrong? (He runs over to help his friend. Behind the bush he discovers BOCCIA humped up between the legs of TERESA, a prostitute. He moves with all the fury of his young years. SALVATORE has never seen people making love before and is speechless.) Damn you, what are you doing? BOCCIA (Shouting) Oh, Christ, it's so good!!! (And he goes on ramming it home.) TERESA Hey, cut it out! Go away. Shoo! With a confused look on his face, SALVATORE picks up the sack and walks away, looking over his shoulder at the couple who go on tossing around more and more frantically.",

Off in one corner, the door of the men's toilet opens and a MAN with a contented look comes out, followed by TERESA, who motions another one to come in. In the projection booth, SALVATORE is eating the meal his mother has brought him. A gangster film. The tense faces of the audience. A gun battle. Rounds of machine-gunfire in the night.

Alternating with the machine-gunfire on screen, a real pistol shoots the back of one of the spectators, the landowner DON VINCENZO, who slumps down in his seat without anybody noticing...The shooting continues up on screen...",

A meeting in the square: the passionate reactions of the peasants listening to a speaker who flails his arms around. At school: the old SCHOOLMISTRESS sitting at her desk, sunk in God knows what dreams, her eyes staring off into empty space, as a tear runs down her pale, unhappy face, and the unknowing STUDENTS carry out their assignments. At the railroad station: the nervous excitement of the people waiting on the platforms. SALVATORE pans his camera on to TWO MEN fighting. But an arriving train comes in between. Salvatore follows the train, pans along the cars. The train stops. -A door opens and the passengers climb out. Several TRADERS, a CARABINTERE, a group of commuting STUDENTS, the TICKET-COLLECTOR, a distinguished looking COUPLE and lastly, a GIRL who stops in the middle of the viewfinder. SALVATORE is immediately attracted by her face. He goes on shooting without leaving it a moment. He follows her through the lens. She is very beautiful, must be around sixteen, a simple, sweet face, blue eyes. She is certainly the daughter of the distinguished looking COUPLE who got off just before she did. The little family moves off down the platform. Salvatore follows the girl's movements, as if hypnotized. Now she passes by him, turns towards him for one moment, as if trying to figure out where he is aiming that funny-looking gadget. SALVATORE smiles at her, entranced.",

ALFREDO is sitting in one corner. He has come to keep him company. He listens to the sound-track of the movie being shown. ALFREDO Chaplin's Modern Times! Right, Toto? SALVATORE That's right, Modern Times. ALFREDO I've shown it so many times I know it by heart. The first time I showed it, in 1940, was the Sunday my first wife died. They kept it hidden from me all day so they wouldn't have to close down the movie house. I only found out that night, after the last show. Those are things you never forget... (Changing his tone.) So, Toto, how are these home movies going? (SALVATORE has switched on the little projector and a square of light appears on the wall beside ALFREDO, with the scenes shot in town.) SALVATORE Yes. (The shots of the slaughter-house have appeared.) ALFREDO (Whispering) What is it, what is it? What's the picture? SALVATORE It's people in the slaughter-house killing a calf. There's blood all over the floor, like a lake. And through this lake another calf passes by on its way to die. ALFREDO is concentrated, as if SALVATORE'S description transmitted the real image to him, the colours, the forms. The railway station has appeared on the wall, and the sequence of ELENA. SALVATORE does not move, does not say a word, as he gazes at those blue eyes looking into the camera. ALFREDO senses something funny in the boy's s11ence.",

In fact, a light suddenly goes on in the room. SALVATORE'S eyes sparkle, have already taken on the hue of victory. The window is pulled open, and his heart starts pounding like a drum. The music reaches its climax. Two hands come out. SALVATORE shuts his eyes for a moment, to hold back the flood of feeling. He opens them again and sees......The hands reach out and take hold of the shutters and pull them shut. The light goes out. It is midnight. An echoing voice does the countdown.",

The pounding of the rain and the rumbling of the thunder drown out the sound-track of the film being shown. Two buckets are on the floor to catch the water dripping through the roof. SALVATORE is alone. For the first time he feels he hates the profession he's got into. He is tearing up the calendar where he checked off the nights he spent waiting for ELENA. He tears it into a thousand pieces, as if trying to wipe out the traces of his grief. He is so absorbed in his thoughts that he doesn't notice that someone has appeared at the top of the stairs and quietly entered the room. And now stands there watching him in silence. The thunder is deafening. That someone is ELENA. She comes up behind him, realizes he is thinking about her. Whispers. ELENA Salvatore... Loud passionate music is heard on the monitor. SALVATORE turns and sees her as if in a dream. It is a sudden blow to the heart. The look on her face is wonderfully sweet, the look of somebody who knows she is madly loved and who now realizes at last that she is in love too. For SALVATORE it is an overwhelming, almost unbearable moment...A long passionate embrace that is never-ending. They are happy, cling to each other never to leave each other again. They spin around, end up against the wall where strips of film are hanging, the first-part endings and the trailers. Another intense look, their eyes locked...And it is their first kiss. A kiss at first timid, hesitant, almost clumsy, and then becomes resolute, poignant. Amidst the film strips dangling around and touching their young faces. Meanwhile the film has finished, the projector turns uselessly...Down below the screen is blank, the audience whistles...But SALVATORE hears nothing, neither the whistles nor the useless whirring of the reels in the projector. All he hears is her breathing, an he feels is the warmth of her skin.",

The USHER has hung a sign on the Cinema Paradiso to the effect that 'Showings to continue at the Imperia Arena', and now climbs into the wagon. The horse moves off slowly and the monotonous clatter of its hoofs reminds SALVATORE that the summer is going to be long this year, longer than ever. And he leans on the projector that totters and lurches from the jolting of the wheels. A cart carrying a cheerful and noisy family pulls up alongside the wagon. There are the MEN from the slaughter-house. They recognize SALVATORE. SLAUGHTER-HOUSE MAN Well, look who's here!! Cecil B. De Mille! Hey, Toto!! When are you coming to shoot another film?!?

The first part has just begun and the reel is full of film. The first part is now about to finish, the reel is almost empty, and ELENA still isn't there. SALVATORE is extremely nervous, worried, mortified by his meeting with her FATHER. He sees ELENA's face pulling away in the car. Thinks back over her terrible confession. He paces back and forth, as if he were in a prison cell, thinking up solutions...The stair light finally goes on; there she is SALVATORE dashes over and down the stairs to meet her. He comes down the final turn of the spiral staircase and finds himself face to face with ALFREDO, who is slowly making his way up with the help of his cane. SALVATORE freezes to the spot.

DAY/NIGHT A wild frenetic sequence, set to the pace of military life...SALVATORE, in uniform with close-cropped hair, answers his superior, shouts: SALVATORE Radio Operator Di Vita Salvatore! Third Battalion, Ninth Company, sir!!! Target practice. SALVATORE fires all the shots in the cartridge, one after the other... A SECOND LIEUTENANT barks out a march rhythm in the blazing sun. SECOND LIEUTENANT One, two, one, two!! Attention! Left march! SALVATORE sneaks out of line, goes over and slips a letter into the mailbox and hurries back to his place. On one of the public phones in a square of Rome, SALVATORE is phoning ELENA. Nobody answers. He slams down the receiver, as the line of SOLDIERS waits its turn... Night-time. A large plastic bag full of water. A thud. SALVATORE wakes up with a start in a lake of ice water. He lets out a terrified shriek as the others laugh, protected by the dark. SALVATORE Aaaaaaah! Heeeeeelp!! In the large dormitory, the SERGEANT is handing out the mail. He throws a pile of letters on SALVATORE'S bunk. They are his letters to ELENA, stamped 'ADDRESS UNKNOWN'. Mess duty. SALVATORE is washing Up, in a sea of water and grease. He rimes a pan full of tomato sauce with a tap hose. A spurt of red water splatters him in the face. A training run. Another letter which SALVATORE drops into the mailbox... A cold, rainy night. SALVATORE stands stiff as a poker in front of the Ammunition depot. It is his first guard duty. Soaked to the skin, gazing wide- eyed into empty space. COLONEL'S office. SALVATORE (Aggressively) Colonel, I was supposed to spend ten days here and it's been about a year, and I haven't ever gone borne. I'd like a furlough, at least! SALVATORE is in the guardhouse. A cold, dark, filthy cell. His nerves start to give way. He bows his head in despair. Hospital. SALVATORE is exhausted, run-down. The night-stand is jammed with medicines. He lies in bed without moving, staring off into empty space, and repeats obsessively in a low voice, as if talking to himself. SALVATORE Elena...Elena...Elena... (He has touched the extreme of suffering, a young man who has been denied love and affection, his rights, freedom. A NURSE comes up.) NURSE Di Vita Salvatore, get ready, your discharge has come through.",

SALVATORE turns towards the Cinema Paradiso. The projectionist is at the window of the booth, smoking a cigarette. Who knows who he is, where he came from. A hot flurry of dust. SALVATORE turns and sees a dog leaping around kim, wagging its tail. It's the dog that kept him company during his nights beneath the window. SALVATORE gives a start of joy, drops his suitcase and leans over to stroke him. Then he hugs him, as if he were an old friend. 93  ALFREDO'S HOUSE. INT. AFTERNOON SALVATORE goes to see ALFREDO.

The girl turns around: it's the daughter of the commanding officer. The lieutenant is scared to death and says: 'Miss, if your heart is as hard as what I have just touched, I'm done for! And they roar with laughter. They look like two old school buddies telling each other dirty jokes. They stop beside a low wall. ALFREDO knows that those laughs are simply a way of uselessly dancing around the countless things that are troubling SALVATORE. And he breaks the ice, while SALVATORE is still laughing.",

(And he bursts into nervous laughter. But this time ALFREDO remains cold, unmoved, does not laugh with him. SALVATORE gradually falls silent. He doesn't know what to say. For the first time in his life, he doesn't know what goal to aim for, doesn't know what to do. The cloud of smoke wreaths his nervous face, now he seems to relax, whispers:) You remember the story of the soldier and the princess? (ALFREDO nods his head.) SALVATORE Now I understand why the soldier went away just before the end. That's right, just one more night and the princess would have been his. But she, also, could not have kept her promise. And...that would have been terrible, he would have died from it. So instead, for ninety-nine nights at least he had lived with the illusion that she was there waiting for him... (This time SALVATORE is the one to explain something to ALFREDO. And ALFREDO realizes how bitter his story is and, above all, that the boy standing there is no longer a boy...) ALFREDO Do like the soldier, Toto! Go away! This land is cursed. (They are now leaning against a boat on the beach. ALFREDO goes on whispering his words.) When you're here every day you feel like you're at the center of the universe, it seems like nothing ever changes. Then you go away, one year, two...And when you come back, everything's different. The thread has broken. You don't find those you were looking for, your things no longer exist. Isn't that the case?...You've got to go away a long time, for many, many years, before coming back and finding your people again, the land where you were born...But not now, it's impossible. Now you're blinder than I am. (Intense words, straight from the heart, and SALVATORE is spellbound. He whispers with a smile:) SALVATORE Who said that? Gary Cooper, James Stewart, Henry Fonda? Huh? (ALFREDO also gives a gentle smile) ALFREDO No, Toto, nobody said it. I say it! Life's not like you saw it in the movies. Life...is harder. (He lays his hand on SALVATORE'S shoulder, gives it a hard squeeze.) Get out! Go back to Rome. You 're young, the world is yours! And I'm old...I don't want to hear you talk any more, I want to hear talk about you. SALVATORE gives a shudder that runs through his very soul. The setting sun lies colorless on the horizon.",

At the intersections, , cars stop to let the black hearse pass by. People cross themselves. The old men remove their hats. Store shutters are lowered. Then, when the procession has passed by, the cars start up again, the old men put their hats back on, the shutters are pulled up. SALVATORE is in the front row with his MOTHER, next to ALFREDO'S WIDOW. SIGNORA ANNA says in a whisper, her eyes fixed on the coffin. ANNA He would have been happy you came, Toto. He always talked about you. Always! Right to the end! He was terribly fond of you... (Tears come to her, she is unable to say any more. SALVATORE gives her a hug, deeply touched by her words.) He left two things for you. Come see me before you leave. SALVATORE nods his head. He gazes intensely at the coffin covered with flowers and is grieved as if he were ashamed never to have come to see the man who had been like a father to him. But why had he forgotten him? Up in front, leading the procession, he sees a young PRIEST with an altar boy beside him, and these figures are also like chisels scraping the rust off his soul and bringing old feelings to light again. The procession reaches the square. The dark column stands etched in the dazzling early-afternoon light. SIGNORA ANNA motions the driver and the procession comes to a halt. It is ALFREDO'S last farewell to the place where he had spent the best years of his life  the Cinema Paradiso. Everyone turns to look and SALVATORE also turns, taken by surprise...It has fallen to pieces: doors and windows boarded shut, crumbling walls, a piece of the sign dangling down, weeds and mildew in the cracks and on the roof. The square has changed completely, is unrecognizable. Buildings, stores, sign boards and lines of cars creeping at a snail's pace in a deafening chorus of honking horns. And the central square has turned motorcycles. SALVATORE turns slowly to look behind him, towards the small crowd, and is entranced by the unexpected sight of faces that he recognizes at once, despite the many years that have gone by:  the MAN AT THE BOX OFFICE, the USHER who also served as bill-poster, the CHARWOMAN, the CARABINIERE SERGEANT, and further on behind ROSA and ANGELO, the lovebirds who had met in the movie house and then got married. They all have white hair. And they too have recognized him, give little hello nods and gestures. Another face he seems to recognize: why sure, it's SPACCAFICO, the owner. How old he's become! He also looks up and his eyes meet SALVATORE'S. A hello nod. SALVATORE makes his way over to him through the crowd. They shake hands heartily, without a word, both touched. The procession starts up again. SALVATORE (Under his breath) How long's it been shut? SPACCAFICO Six years ago this May. No one came any more. You \"know better than me, Mr. Di Vita, the crisis, television, videos. By now the movie business is only a dream. The city's bought it now to make a new parking lot. Next Saturday they're tearing it down...A pity!...",

                    "raw_text": ". PROJECTION BOOTH. INT. DAY SALVATORE'S silhouette stands out against the light in the open door. S lowly he makes his way into the empty theatre. A thick layer of dust lends everything a gray, rarefied look. The light streaming in from the windows up above teems with strange mates of dust, like a haze. Cobwebs hang like long veils from the ceiling. SALVATORE walks down the middle aisle. The rows of seats are unhinged, what was once the wooden veneer has warped from the dampness. He looks around as if he Were thumbing through the album of his memories. The screen dangles from its frame. The emergency exits are boarded and nailed shut. Observing the emptiness of the theatre, SALVATORE has the feeling he can hear the howling, the whistling and voices of the . audience, as he remembers it. But only for one brief moment, then the silence returns. A mouse creeps along one wall, stops near a pile of dust. SALVATORE is attracted by that little gray mass. He goes over as the mouse scampers off, takes a closer look and recognizes the shape of half a lion's head covered with dust. He moves it with his foot, then looks up at the projection booth, repeating the same gesture of bygone years. But the lion's head is no longer there, only the outline of it on the wall, and cobwebs have covered the hales of the booth, those little square openings that had caused him such long suffering as a little boy...SALVATORE now climbs up the spiral staircase. Each step kicks up a little cloud of dust. The little booth, yellow with fumes, appears before him again. Now it looks like some big, empty cave. The projector is no longer there, nor the equipment. Who knows where they junked them?! The only thing left is a clump of film strips still attached to the wall: trailers, Part One endings, etc...There he had kissed ELENA for the first time, and strips of film like those had grazed their faces. Now they are caught up in the coils of cobwebs. And where the film-winder once stood, the nails remain with thousands of yellowing receipts. Of all the films shown at the Cinema Paradiso Palace. And three more boxfuls of them are on the floor. And the windows overlooking the square are bolted shut and the glass broken. SALVATORE peers out of one of the cracks in the window and sees the village...which is now a city. A different world he no longer knows. 105  CAFE IN SQUARE. INT/EXT. DAY The cafe in the square has been completely renovated. The CASHIER and BARMEN have young, unfamiliar faces. SALVATORE holds out the receipt with a tip. SALVATORE A double whisky, please. Several BOYS are sitting at the comer tables, talking about girls. Others stand playing 'war games', shake around to the obsessive strains of same electronic tune. A man comes up to SALVATORE and asks for his autograph. Then SALVATORE turns to the plate-glass window overlooking the main street, where the workers' club once was. And like a flash, a shudder freezes him to the spot.... Two steps away from him, through the glass, a stunning vision, which casts him beyond time, chills his blood: there before him is ELENA! But she is still young, young as she was then! Sweet, luminous, alluring, exactly the way he saw her the first time at the station. She is waiting to go across the street with a bunch of books under her arm...Have the passing years had no effect on her? Or is she an hallucination? No! It's a dream! Or is he dead too, like ALFREDO? SALVATORE doesn't know how to explain it. And he is suddenly seized by a feeling of panic. His glass drops to the floor...As the GIRL walks off... 106  GIANCALDO. STREET. EXT. DAY At the age of fifty-five, SALVATORE feels no scruples about wandering the streets of his home town, spying from a distance on an eighteen- year-old girl. There's nothing he can do about it. He stares at her with the amazement of someone who discovers that miracles exist. Now he is nearer to her. How lovely she is! It's her, no doubt about it! Exactly the same. Except she has a different hair-do and is wearing different clothes:  ELENA didn't wear slacks. The GIRL goes up to a parked motorcycle. She removes the padlock and fastens her books to the rack. SALVATORE is standing there a few steps away, and without stopping to think, moves a little closer, discreetly, politely.",

AFTERNOON The old shots of ELENA getting off the train and walking away, casting a curious look at the camera...SALVATORE is watching her again, projected on the white wall of his room. He also watches the other shots of those happy long-gone days the picnic,. she at the beach, smiling, joyful...And again SALVATORE doesn't understand, or doesn't want to understand. But these scenes could have been shot yesterday, so identical to ELENA is the girl he saw on the street...And the wound which he thought had healed years ago, starts bleeding again. The lingering note of suffering for a romance that had ended without his ever knowing why, and the endless explanations that had been sifted through by his young mind, start slipping through his soul again, like those shots slipping again through an old 8mm projector. Through the crack of the door, MARIA sees those images on the wall, SALVATORE rocking his head back and forth slowly, like he used to do as a boy when he cried. She somehow feels his grief, his bitterness, lowers her eyes and walks away without a word, as the little shiny rectangle on the wall remains blank, empty...And SALVATORE sits there gazing at it, as if he saw other scenes which his camera never set down on film, only his memory. 108  HIGH SCHOOL. STREETS AND LITTLE SQUARE. EXT. DAY The HIGH SCHOOL STUDENTS are coming out after school. Happy young faces. That GIRL 's motorcycle can be seen in a rear-view mirror. SALVATORE is at the wheel of the car ALFIO has lent him. He has obviously followed that motorcycle before. He waits with an eagerness he thought he had long lost, a determination to understand, to get to the bottom of the matter, which frightens him and at the same time overwhelms him hopelessly. And here she comes. She unlocks the padlock and prepares to speed off. SALVATORE starts the motor and follows her a short distance away. The GIRL heads for the new residential district on the outskirts. 109  SALVATORE'S MOTHER'S HOUSE. INT. DAY MARIA is setting the table. LIA and her family are eating at her house today. SALVATORE is sitting again, with a lighted cigarette, gazing through the window at the shrubs tossing in the wind and the rolling sea. The air whistling through the cracks of the windows lends a heaviness to the silence, like the troubled look on his face. MARIA glances at him. MARIA What are you thinking, Toto? SALVATORE looks at the old woman's lovely face, a faint smile. on his lips. There was always something like an unspoken rule between them, the rule of silence, of unconfessed complicity. And now he feels that rule has to be broken. He speaks quietly, as if to curb the tumult of his feelings of guilt.",

He feels relieved by the roar of the waves that dispels his bitter thoughts, blurs them, but does not wipe out the look of suffering in his eyes. A flashing light seems to approach behind his back. SALVATORE turns and is blinded by the headlights of a car parked at the beginning of the pier. The splattering waves lend the scene a hazy cast and diffuse the glare of the flashing headlights. Now the lights move towards him. And SALVATORE also lakes a few timid steps forward... They are close. The car has almost stopped. But it is impossible to make out the person at the wheel who now reaches over to open the other door. A voice can be barely heard over the raging sea. It is ELENA's voice. ELENA Salvatore! SALVATORE approaches, accepting the invitation, enters the car and shuts the door. The headlights go off and the car remains there suspended between the open sea and the harbor with its rocking boats. Inside the car, not a word. Two dark figures gaze at each other, unintelligible, as if the night were trying to further delay that meeting. The glowing reflection of a wave higher than the others now lights up their faces. ELENA was right, they are no longer the faces of teenagers, but of people on in years who study each other, searching for a truth. The howling of the wind and the crashing of the waves are louder, but ELENA and SALVATORE /rear nothing, sit glued to their seats, fixed in the endless gaze that envelops them. He is the first to break the silence in a faint voice.",

DAY A cloud of yellowed scraps of paper flutters into the air and as it falls slowly to the ground another handful is flung up. SALVATORE is in the projection booth, looking through the countless yellowed receipts, stuffed away in boxes. He looks at them one by one, then throws them into the air. A desperate search, almost a defiance of the passing of time. He continues with greater determination, flings piles of receipts into the air, glances at a few dates, a film title, tries to discover the oldest dates at the bottom. He moves swiftly, his hands plunge in, then fling up a nimbus of paper and dust. But to no avail...He stops, short of breath. His eyes go over to the nails in the wall, where other stacks of receipts are hanging. He gets up and goes to look at them, thumbs \" it through them hastily, in anger... He yanks off two or three packs, which come off, nail and all. Only then does he notice that at the bottom of those blocks of yellowed paper, there are same more sheets, much older, almost brown. His eyes concentrate on the mildewed scraps of paper. He leans over, picks themup and goes through them one by one, delicately, because they crumble in his fingers...And then all of a sudden, some film titles he recognizes from that time. He goes on thumbing through them, and all at once an astonished look appears on his face  in his hands is a receipt that has been turned over. It's the one! The message scribbled on it can still be seen. He reads it. SALVATORE'S VOICE (Off-screen) Salvatore, forgive me. I'll explain later what happened. Not finding you here was terrible. Unfortunately, this evening, my mother and I are leaving for Tuscany. We're moving there. But you' re the only one I love, I'll never be with anybody else, I promise. Here's the address of a girlfriend of mine where you can write to me. Don't abandon me. Love and kisses, Elena. He clasps the scrap of paper, and his brimming eyes darken with regret.",
