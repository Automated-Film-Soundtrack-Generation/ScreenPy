Many of the faces are uncertain -- Hasari's notable among them. MONTAGE - INT./EXT. COWSHEDS - DAY A) Two cows are shooed out of the ramshackle building as bustling activity on the new clinic begins. Cleaning the place. Debris being torn out, hurled into a pile in the street. B) Said, with the strength of three men, holds up a heavy beam while Hasari tries to secure it. Max, hot, smelly, and hating the place, stands in the middle of the room, wishing he were elsewhere. The beams starts to slip. Max leaps to Hasari's side. C) We see    that Max and Hasari are thrown together again in some    carpentering task in uneasy camaraderie. A finger    pokes Max on the back. He turns to find Poomina    holding out two cups of tea. D) The whole    group shares a meal, prepared under   the direction    of Selima, though the lepers remain   separate from the    normals. Anouar leads the lepers in    singing a song.     Joan and Margareta pick it up, as do   several other of    the normals. E) Equipment from the old school/clinic being moved from the square down here. F) Max and Aloka do one of those dances where two people with arms loaded try to go around each other. Finally he says he'll stand still and she should go around him. They both laugh. Hasari watches. G) As Max puts medicine into a cabinet, Ram peeks in, nods his approval, \"helpfully\" passes Max something Max can reach just fine himself, shows Max an enormous hole in his shorts and hits Max for ten rupees. H) A small truck carrying a charitable organization's logo on the side is being unloaded of powdered milk and various other things. (CONTINUED)",

J) THEIR POV Everyone gathered as Shanta and Ashish put a banner above the door: \"You are invited to the festival of this world and your life is blessed.\" The assemblage applauds and embraces.

A bottle of GASOLINE has EXPLODED just behind him. He's enveloped in smoke. An assailant bears down on Joan with a cutlass. As the assailant is about to strike, Hasari seizes the attacker and hurls him backward. Ashish steps in and slashes the assailant with his own weapon, startling, even repelling Hasari. From all over   the lane, young fighters have come and joined the fray, not   bothering to choose sides but merely enjoying the release.    Hasari lunges for a woman under attack by a boy, arriving   too late to stop the boy from plunging his knife into the   woman's belly. Hasari fights his way to the woman, but   she staggers into the mob. Max knocks down one of the thugs only to have  another hand grasp his shoulder.

The rain falls, the WIND HOWLS, and people in the lane are dancing, praising the beginning of the monsoon season. Men tear off their shirts, women rush out fully clothed, singing. Swarms of naked children run about. The kids run toward the clinic/school. EXT. CLINIC COURTYARD - DAY Hasari is locking his rickshaw into the shed. Staff and several patients come out of the examining rooms -- Joan, Aloka, Sunil, Anouar, Poomina. Margareta and her students, a new teacher, Bandona, her students come out of the classrooms... They're all swept up in dancing, Joan's metal cross jumping about as if it were beating out time. From his balcony, Max emerges with his trumpet and plays the first bars of \"Singin' In the Rain.\" Everyone looks his way; he begins to hum and sing as he jumps over the balcony to the ground and takes off in a wild, impro- vished, but damn good version of Gene Kelly's dance in the rain, bringing Anouar on his cart in as his dancing partner. Everyone in the courtyard crowds around them, laughing and encouraging the dancer/singers on. The number builds to an extraordinary climax with Max sliding through mud to an exquisite finish at Joan's feet. There's thunderous applause. INT. CLINIC - NIGHT Rain.
