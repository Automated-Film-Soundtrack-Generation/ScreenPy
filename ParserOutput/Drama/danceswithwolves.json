Timmons screams like a half-butchered hog and starts into an odd crippled run. He clears the gully where he's been camped and struggles up the incline. Another swish and another scream, as another arrow catches him high on the shoulder. Terrified with pain and fear, Timmons looks back as he scrambles up the slope. Here comes the Toughest at a lazy gallop. He's riding only with his legs. His hands are busy with bow and arrows. Casual but blink quick, the Toughest snatches another arrow from the quiver at his waist, strings it and fires. This arrow catches Timmons in the gut. He falls squirming against the slope. The Toughest is still coming, his face like granite as he fires arrow after arrow. The three warriors who came with the Toughest have reached the wagon. Two of them are slicing away harness on the team of nice army horses. The third is rifling through Timmons' gear. This man unwittingly picks up Timmons' blanket. When he gets a whiff of its stink, the warrior flings it far out on the grass. Then he drops to one knee, scoops up some dirt and rubs it between his soiled hands.",

Dunbar is struck dumb. He stands still as the pageant passes in front of him. The sight of Dunbar troubles Wind In His Hair, so much that he pulls up a hundred yards away. He sits a moment on his whirling pony, trying to decide if he should confront this white god. He makes a warrior's choice. Wind In His Hair shouts to his fellows to go on and charges down the slope... straight for Dunbar. Dunbar's eyes are fixed on the closing horseman. He can't move. Wind In His Hair is coming flat out, his lance extended. At the last moment he pulls up so hard that the black pony skids to a sit. The horse is up quickly and hard to manage.

And all of it is gleaming... from the brass buttons to the gold epaulettes to the army issue belt buckle. The red sash flutters and Cisco shies to one side. Dunbar slaps at the sash, calms his horse and jumps on. We stop with them at the supply house. Old Glory is standing against one of the crumbling walls. The flag has been affixed to a long willow branch. Dunbar sweeps it up and sticks the staff into one of his boots. They start off at a jog, the flag popping in the stiff morning breeze.

She dabs at a large pool of blood spreading in the ground next to her thigh. Suddenly she's alert. Stands With A Fist has heard something too... a strange popping sound. She turns. The gleaming buckskin horse is standing thirty or forty feet behind her on the top of the knoll. A white soldier is sitting on the horse.

One of the soldier's hands is trying to claw it away from his face. Dunbar pulls the flag away. It's an Indian woman alright. But now that she is staring at him open-mouthed and afraid, he can see that there is something odd about her. Too late for further study.

The rest of his body has been left to rot in the sun. The column, so noisy and happy before, winds its way through the killing ground in silence. There must be twenty-five buffalo like the one we saw close up, all of them stripped and rotting. Dunbar looks queasy. The lieutenant glances at the medicine man riding next to him. Kicking Bird looks sick too. Dunbar looks away. The entire column is stretched along the killing ground, looking. A naked cow, covered with birds, lies on her side. Her new born calf, doomed to death, cries for his dead mother. And next to the calf, Dunbar sees something else. He sees wagon tracks and the booted footprints of white men.",

Several of the other men have scalps too. None of the hair is Indian. Dunbar can see into the wagonbed now. A couple of dozen fresh buffalo hides are stacked in the wagonbed. It's all come clear.

Dunbar kicks Cisco into a run, spits a spare bullet from his mouth and rams it into the chamber. Smiles A Lot is picking himself off the ground. The bull is in full charge. Dunbar is riding with his knees. Both hands are holding the rifle. He'll never make it to the boy in time. He's got to make the shot. He squeezes the trigger. The bullet plows home, exploding the bull's heart. The big buffalo's legs collapse but the momentum of his charge puts him into a skid. He comes to rest only a few yards away from Smiles A Lot. The boy stands as the lieutenant rides up. Smiles A Lot is dazed but he's okay. Dunbar hops off next to the dead buffalo. He's a huge one, a real grandfather and the lieutenant loses himself for a few moments in contemplation of this tremendous kill. Now he looks back to check the boy. Smiles A Lot has caught his pony and is racing away from the scene of his humiliation. The sounds of approaching riders turns Dunbar's attention in a different direction. The entire village is streaming onto the plains for the butchering. The riders bearing down on him are being lead by Wind In His Hair. Wind In His Hair jumps off his pony and, smiling broadly, slaps Dunbar's back with a good-natured blow of congratulations.",

A sizable crowd has gathered to watch this ritual. Wind In His Hair sticks the fresh liver in his mouth and happily bites off a chunk, letting the juices run from the edges of his mouth. Now he figures the lieutenant knows what to do, and hands the liver back to him. Dunbar doesn't want to do this, but with the pressure of so many eyes and so much good will, he has little choice. Tentatively, he bites off a small piece and chews it thoughtfully. It's good. Encouraged by this good taste, Dunbar takes a man-sized bite. Shrill Sioux voices rise all around him as they cheer the lieutenant. Dunbar holds the liver triumphantly over his head.",

This is dancing purely for the fun of it. One of the young women spots him standing behind the lodge and there's a wave of shy giggling as news of \"loo ten tant's\" presence is passed along. Embarrassed, Dunbar starts along the fringe of the fires, nodding politely to the women as he goes. One has more courage than the others. She breaks out, takes his hand and steers him gently into the dance circle. Whatever resistance he might have is buried by the girl's insistent encouragement. She keeps showing him the step and the lieutenant tries to pick it up. The movement is simple and the music is mesmerizing. Awkward at first, Dunbar quickly gets the hang of it. In short order, he's keeping up with the others. And he's enjoying himself. Soon he has relaxed enough to shut his eyes, carried along by the eternal sound of the drums. He doesn't notice that the circle has begun to shrink. There is a touch of the devil in their eyes. He bumps into somebody and the woman behind bumps into him. But the girls just laugh and so does Dunbar. It was a pleasant accident. But quickly there's another accident. And then all their bodies are squeezing against his. The girls are murmuring good things to him. Their hands are touching him everywhere. It's okay with Dunbar. Everybody's having a good time. The drumming suddenly stops however, and the women scatter away from the fire, leaving Dunbar suddenly alone. Kicking Bird is standing not far off.",

Kicking Bird too has stopped. Just ahead the forest opens into an incredible cathedral-like expanse. Sunlight streams down onto the floor in beautiful pools. But still there is a deathly quiet and Dances With Wolves can see now that this remarkable place has been horribly desecrated. Trees have been felled everywhere, most of them left to rot for no explicable reason. At the same time he sees this destruction Dances With Wolves realizes that the strange buzzing sound is not coming from overhead but from the forest floor. The insects are not bees. They are flies and they are swarming over dozens of carcasses strewn over the ground. Badgers, skunks, squirrels and other small animals, nearly all of them killed merely for target practice. The men and their ponies move on. Deer carcasses are everywhere, many of them horribly mutilated. A choice flank portion is cut away here and there, while ninety-five percent of the bodies have been left to rot. Heads and legs have been chopped off. Dances With Wolves passes by a spot where several deer heads have been placed nose to nose as if the heads were having a conversation. Someone's perverted idea of humor. The men ride through the carnage in a sad daze. Now they reach the center of the cathedral and here they find a few crude leantos, hewn from freshly cut wood. The people who stayed here had bigger plans for all the felled wood, but lost ambition and settled for these ugly hovels. A great pile of wild turkeys, perhaps twenty birds in all, sit to one side. They haven't even been plucked. Just shot and left to rot. Dances With Wolves notices half a dozen liquor bottles in a heap of trash. He cannot bring himself to look at Kicking Bird.

Before he can take a step, a hatchet buries itself to the hilt. Smiles A Lot is at the other end. But Bauer is not through. His hands are around the boy's neck, choking him with his last seconds of life. A larger than life Wind In His Hair draws even and swings his club.
