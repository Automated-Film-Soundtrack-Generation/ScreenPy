Grappling hooks grab against the lip around the roof and silent figures climb to the top of the building. Men in armour vests, clutching the latest in special weapons, take position here and there about the development. Other men strategically place their cars and trucks in the court below. 38         On the roof, at an entrance to one of the building's fire stairs, Roger squats silently alongside three other team members. The men check their weapons. Roger looks at his watch. The sweep hand reaches the 12... Roger:        (to himself) LIGHTS. 39         In an instant, large searchlights bathe the side of the building. The troop commander, shielded with other Officers behind a large truck, shouts through an electric bullhorn. Commander:   MARTINEZ...YOU'VE BEEN WATCHING...YOU KNOW WE HAVE THE BUILDING SURROUNDED... The electronically amplified voice echoes through the concrete caverns between the buildings of the project. There are only a few windows which glow with lights from inside.

He disappears through the smoke as other officers begin to restore order among the civilians. Women scream and cry over their dead-loved ones. Roger is helped to his feet by another Officer. Roger's eyes are wide and staring through the insect-like lenses of his mask. They are locked on the sight he sees through the door of the apartment which Wooley kicked open. The other Trooper looks and his eyes widen as well. 53         In the apartment, lying in a pool of blood, are the partial remains of what was a human body. It has been ripped to shreds. Roger staggers against the door frame. The other trooper moves inside. Another corpse, also mutilated, one leg missing, one arm badly mangled. It is trying to move. To reach the Troopers. 54         A sudden loud scream. Roger startles and spins around. A woman in the hall has seen the grisly sight, and she runs screaming down the corridor.

Trooper 2:   SHOOT IT...SHOOT IT THROUGH THE HEAD. The young officer is too dumb struck to respond so the third Officer pulls out his pistol. Then suddenly, from out of the shadows, a spectre-like figure lunges at the third Officer, flailing and biting at his arms. It is a wild-haired woman. There are several bleeding wounds over her body. She is one of the walking dead. The Trooper struggles to free himself, and Roger darts into the room. Although the Zombie is weak, she manages to hold on to the Trooper. Another creature suddenly appears in the bedroom doorway. A male, it staggers out into the room. The young Trooper struggles with his holster trying to free his hand gun. Suddenly, he feels something on his leg. The dismembered corpse is clutching his ankle, pulling itself closer, it's mouth open. The boy tries to pull away, but falls onto the floor, crashing over a table and lamp. He tries to crawl away, but the frail corpse keeps its hold and drags along behind the young Trooper, who still cannot free his pistol. Roger and the third Officer fling all their weight against the woman Zombie. She flies against a wall, but bounces back immediately, and attacks again. The third Trooper's rifle fires. A slug tears through the woman's chest but it doesn't stop her onslaught. Another shot rips through her neck. Still she comes. The boy on the floor manages to level off his pistol. He fires at the ghoulish head which draws closer to his leg. The thing's skull blows open and its grasp relaxes. The boy is shaking violently. His arm and gun stay in the air, still poised. He fires again...and again...and again. 56         In the hall, the male Zombie appears, and the crowd panics. The Troopers try to keep things calm.

It bites at her neck...her arm. She screams with terror. She tries to pull away, but the creature holds her. It bites again. A Trooper comes up from behind and tries to wrestle the creature away. Another Trooper grabs the woman and tries to free her. She is screaming insanely. The Zombie pulls another piece of flesh off her arm. S.W.A.T. 3:  STAND CLEAR...FOR CHRISSAKE...STAND CLEAR! 57         In the apartment, the female Zombie lunges at the third Trooper and the two tumble to the floor. Roger wrestles her free and, with all his might, throws her against the wall. She advances again. Roger raises his gun, She is just about to reach him. He fires. The bullet drops her. 58         In the hall, a Trooper brings his gun butt slamming against the male ghoul's head. The creature loses his grip on the screaming woman. The Trooper who is holding her, pulls her free across the floor. S.W.A.T. 3 fires. The bullet tears through the Zombie's shoulder...another shot...through his neck...another...through the skull. It falls. 59         There is finally a calm. A few of the citizens murmur prayers. Troopers and befuddled old people seem to drift through the clouds of gas in a totally dazed state. 60         Roger and the third Trooper from the apartment drift to the hallway. The third Trooper moves into the crowd, but Roger stands against the open door jamb for a moment. A sudden, loud gunshot makes Roger duck and spin around. He looks into the apartment. The young Trooper has shot himself through the head. 61         In the dark firestair, it is very quiet. Roger bursts through a metal door from one of the halls and falls against the stair railing. He is retching. He breathes heavily to contain himself. He removes his mask and coughs slightly from the gas mist which still clings in the air. Voice:",

The rest of the riot troops stand at the ready, weapons raised...high powered rifles...flame throwers... The nails creak loudly as they are pulled free. The men are silent, not knowing what to expect. There are three boards left...then two... With a great, tearing sound, the door flies open before the men remove the last boards. The boards fly and the door almost rips off its hinges. Like flood waters, a small army of Zombies pushes into the hall. They are wide eyed and terrifying. In life, they were mostly Blacks and Puerto Ricans from the neighbouring buildings. They are all ages, from the very old to the very young. The riot troops are stunned. They cannot react quickly enough, and the squeeze is so tight in the little hall that it is impossible to shoot accurately, or without the bullets injuring other troopers. The men fight back, wrestling and trying to back away. In the front line, Zombies bite at the flesh of the humans. Teeth tear into arms and hands. Some men are trampled in the crush. Commander:   BACK OFF...BACK OFF...SPREAD OUT... The rear lines retreat into the wider vestibule, and as the mass of struggling bodies spreads out, shots begin to fire. Some Troopers, at close quarters, are able to fire off accurate rounds with their hand guns. Others fall and are lunged at by clutching ghouls. Roger and the Black Trooper are in the middle of the battle. They fight off several of the creatures. The battle spreads into little skirmishes through the dark hallways. The highly organised Troopers are scattered and confused by the mindless onslaught. 64         As the main action moves away from the entrance to the storage area, several Troopers move into the room. The walls are dank and grey. There is a dripping sound. All around lie remnants of human civilisation. Baby buggies and bicycles chained to pipes which ring the area. Large trunks and cartons of every size and shape; old beds and other furniture. And here and there throughout the large area lie the remains of corpses. They have been eaten away. Most of them are still moving, their heads uninjured. Two of the Troopers retreat, revulsed. The sound of the gunfire and screaming can be heard from the hall. The big Black man walks calmly into the room. Roger watches him. He walks up to the writhing creatures one at a time, and fires carefully aimed shots into their heads with his hand gun. Tears roll down his cheeks. Some of the creatures are without arms and legs. Some have been eaten away about the neck and shoulder. They moan with a gurgling, gutteral sound as they try to move. A young Black Zombie, pulling itself along the floor with one arm, draws close to the Black Trooper. The big man aims his pistol. It clicks...empty. He quickly and efficiently reaches for more ammunition and begins to reload. The Zombie pulls closer, its mouth wide. Roger steps up behind the other Trooper and fires into the creatures head with his automatic rifle. The Black man brushes tears from his eyes and continues to load the pistol. Roger disposes of several other creatures. he comes to a place where several are piled together. Some lie still, others writhe about. Two on the heap, although they cannot move about, are eating at parts of other bodies. Roger shoots them. They never look up. They don't seem to notice him at all. A loud creaking sound breaks the mood suddenly. Roger looks up. 65         In the ceiling, a double set of loading doors has been opened. Several other Troopers look down into the storage area.

There are a few big Police launches still docked in the marina. They bob about silently. The chain, which normally restricted the area, is broken and dangling. The sign, which reads: CITY OF PHILADELPHIA - POLICE - NO ADMITTANCE clangs against the broken chain in the wind. Halfway down the long dock is a little guard house. Inside, sitting at a radio transmitter, is the corpse of a uniformed guard. Nearby is a separate floating dock on which is painted a large square pattern. It is a landing bay for Police helicopters. Alongside, afloat separately but securely chained fast, is a small fuel barge, with pumps and hoses for refueling the chopper and launches. The other bodies lie bleeding on the bobbing docks, another officer and a civilian. A bell buoy rings in the distance and we begin to hear the sound of an approaching helicopter. The blades of the J.A.S. Traffic Copter whine as they gear down for a landing. The whirlybird settles like a hummingbird on the gently bobbing heliport. 69         With the blades still spinning loudly, Stephen hops out of the cockpit. Steve:",

The wind from the chopper blades blows her hair and sends more debris flying. 123        Peter kicks open the door to the chart house. The room is dusty and dilapidated. A few small chairs surround an old wooden table. Several half finished cups of coffee sit on top of wrinkled flight charts leaving brown rings on the paper. Flies buzz loudly. An old window shade clicks against its window from the gusting of the wind and it makes Peter flinch. He readies his weapon.

Now the door bangs violently with a loud crash, but it holds. Peter sets his coffee on the chart table and takes his rifle in both hands. Again the door bangs hard, and a skeleton key is knocked out of the keyhole. It falls to the floor with a metallic clang, and Peter notices a caked blood stain where blood recently ran out of the closet, under the door and onto the linoleum. Another bang and a gurgling moan.

A little up the grade, she turns and looks back, stopping again. One Zombie turns slowly and starts up the grade after Fran. The other continues to advance on Stephen. 130        Stephen ducks back into the open hangar. It is very dark but for thin beams of sunlight which cut through between the wooden boards of the structure. Stephen roots around among the greasy tools which clutter the area. He finds an enormous sledge hammer. He runs out of the shed. 131        He dodges around the lead Zombie, who staggers on with inertia. Steve sees that Fran is still facing the second creature. The man takes a firm grip on the giant hammer as he charges up the grade toward the Zombie's back. As he reaches the creature, he brings the twenty pound steel head of the sledge slamming against the ghoul's skull with all his might. The creature staggers on for a few more steps, its head a bloody pulp, then it falls to its knees and finally flops face down in the dust. Without breaking stride, Stephen grabs Fran's hand and the two run toward the helicopter. The other Zombie at the hangar has turned around and is walking up the grade. 132        Roger is pumping the last drops out of the fuel hose when he sees the frightened couple making for the chopper. 133        As Steve charges up the grade he sees the Zombie approaching Roger from behind.  Steve shouts and Roger spins around. The stumbling creature is very close. It raises its arms and its hands clutch at the air. Roger lets the fuel nozzle drop to the ground. He is trapped at the side of the machine. He doesn't have his rifle. He fumbles with the snap on his hand-gun holster. Suddenly, the blank face of the Zombie turns red as the top of its head seems to disintegrate into a bloody pulp. The creature has walked into the spinning chopper blade. Its body staggers forward another step or two, then the thing collapses in a heap. 134        Stephen and Fran have reached the chopper. Steve let's go of the woman's hand and he drops his bloody sledge to the ground. He lunges into the cockpit and snatches up his rifle, ducking in the propeller draft. 135        The Zombie which is stumbling up the grade from the hangars almost loses its footing, but it regains its balance and advances steadily toward the helicopter. 136        The shot misses clean. He fires again. The bullet grazes the creature's face. It staggers from the impact, but does not fall. 137        Roger moves quickly for his high powered weapon. Steve fires two more rounds. 138        Another miss and another graze, this time on the arm. 139        He is about to shoot once more when Roger stops him, stepping up alongside. Roger calmly aims and fires one shot cleanly through the creatures' brain. 140        The Zombie falls and papers blow over its body. 141        In the chart house. Peter fires several more shots into the closet door. Bullet holes appear just where the creature's head should be. There seems to be no way that the volley could have missed. Silence for a moment. Peter still holds his gun high. Then, with a great crash, the closet door flies open into the room. Two small children burst out. One has no left arm; the other has been bleeding from a great wound in his side. They are dead. They move directly toward Peter. Their heads are at least a foot shorter than the bullet holes in the closet door. Peter stares down at the creatures, revulsed.  He is so startled that he cannot react quickly enough, and they are on him. The moment he feels their clammy grasp, he regains his survival instincts. He cannot effectively aim his rifle. He kicks and thrashes around. One creature flies against a wall. The other is about to bite the man's arm. The big Black grabs the small Zombie and flings it physically back. The other creature pounces on his back. He throws it over his shoulders and it crashes against its brother. Now Peter raises his gun. As the children try to scramble to their feet the man fires several shots in rapid succession. First one creature falls; then the other. Peter continues to fire, his eyes wide with desperation and disgust. Finally his weapon clicks. It is out of ammunition. Peter breathes heavily. He stares at the small corpses. Instinctively, he begins loading his weapon, without even looking at the action, as he backs wearily out toward the door of the chart house. 142        Behind him, in the brightly sunlit doorway, we see the Zombie who first appeared at the window. The creature staggers forward. Peter turns and startles. He reaches for more shells and backs away a few steps as he tries to load the bullets into his gun. The creature reaches out and takes another step into the room. Peter stares into the creatures eyes. Then suddenly, out in the sunlight, a few hundred feet behind the Zombie, Stephen appears with his rifle. Peter sees the man over the creature's shoulder. 143        Steve raises his gun and aims at the Zombie, but the barrel seems to be on a straight line with Peter. 144        Peter ducks quickly. Steve's gun fires. The bullet misses the creature cleanly and crashes into the room. It ricochets off the coffee machine. Another shot crashes through the glass in the front room. Peter crouches, still stuffing shells into his weapon. A third of Stephen's bullets tears through the Zombie's shoulder, but the creature still stands. It turns toward Peter slowly. Peter crawls under the table as another shot splatters into the coffee cups. 145        Once again, Roger steps up beside Stephen.  He fires one carefully aimed shot, looking through his telescopic range- finder. 146        Just as Peter finishes loading his weapon, the Zombie crashes into the room, falling over the table and onto the floor. 147        Fran is still kneeling in the dust, trying to keep herself from vomiting. Stephen rushes to her side. Roger, keeping his rifle poised, shouts toward the chart house. Roger:",

Immediately, he sees the anger in Peter's eyes. The big Trooper then raises his rifle and aims it a Stephen. Steve tries to stand, but trips and falls on his back in the dust.

The dry earth swirls up into clouds and blows more bits of paper over the wide-eyed corpses which lie in the morning sunlight. 157        We see the facade of an enormous structure. It is a huge, suburban shopping mall. The outer walls are all concrete, and their clean lines stretch upward for more than two storeys. The building looks like a giant domino lying flat on the ground. There are only four entrances, and the shops which are housed within have no windows opening onto the surrounding lot. 158        In the immense area around the building, lanes and stalls are painted for automobile parking. What few cars now dot the area are parked randomly, some with their doors open wide. 159        We hear the sound of the helicopter engine fading in, then we see the little machine as it approaches and eases down onto the roof of the building. 160        In the parking lot, walking among the abandoned vehicles, we see several of the living dead.  They look almost like normal shoppers at the mall for morning chores, but their lumbering        walk is unmistakably stiff. 161        At one of the mall entrances, we see a revolving door flanked by several regularly hinged doors, all made of glass and surrounded by large windows. A few of the Zombies manage to        negotiate the hinged doors and enter the building. Others bounce off windows and claw the transparent glass in confusion. One creature walks around in the revolving door endlessly. There are a good many of the creatures, but they are spread out and far between. They move with no seeming purpose. We do not yet see the mall interior.  The Zombies pay no        attention to the sound of the chopper engine stopping overhead. 162        On the roof, even as the blades of the helicopter still spin, the humans are out and moving to the edge of the building. They look down at the creatures which dot the parking lot. Fran:",

The door opens slowly, and the Troopers cautiously step out. As the camera swings around, we see that the men are at the end of a long narrow hallway. Directly across from them are two open supply rooms, one containing a stationery sink and a toilet. Both rooms are filled with cleaning supplies.193        Down along the hall can be seen a dozen or so doorways. Some doors are open, some are closed. Along the opposite wall there is nothing.        The far end of the hall, about a hundred yards away, opens out onto the second story of the mall proper.194        The men look at one another and slowly move down the corridor. They try the first two doors, which are locked. The third is wide open. 195        Roger ducks quickly into the room with his rifle raised. It is a large administrative office, with rows of desks which are fully equipped for a staff of secretaries and accountants.196        The next room has a closed door, but it is unlocked. Peter        swings the door open and silently jumps into the room. This is a much more spartan area, with two metal desks and a few chairs. There are several phones. It is a maintenance office. On one wall is a large map of the mall, with pin flags and scribbling over an acetate which covers the drawing. At the other end of the space is a huge electrical panel with circuit breakers and an entire series of master controls all keyed by a number code to another map of the mall showing electrical installations.        On the wall behind Peter is a large blackboard and two metal cabinets. One is open. It contains all sorts of tools, manual and electric. There are circuit testers, walkie talkie units and there are several enormous rings containing hundreds of keys, also colour and number coded. Peter grabs up one of the rings and Roger steps up behind him.        Roger:",

This opens onto beautifully plush offices, obviously the executive headquarters.        The rooms interconnect, and while Peter walks from door to door in the corridor, Roger moves through the inner doors, meeting Peter at each room. One office is more elegant than the next, with the latest in designer furniture and expensive decorations.198        The Troopers finally reach a room on which both the interior and corridor doors are closed and locked. The brass nameplate on the interior door reads C.J. Porter - President.199        Roger moves out to the corridor where he joins Peter. They move into the exterior corridor. They are very near the end of the hall, and the brightly lit shopping area is close at hand. They can only see a small section.200        The balcony on their side is railed off against the open drop down to the first floor, and across the great cavity they see the opposite balcony. On the far side only two store fronts can be seen. They are both gated and shut. 201        The two realise what dangers might face them in the mall proper. They look at each other and move forward, each clinging to opposite walls in the corridor.202        As they reach the mall proper they slowly and carefully peer around their respective corners. 203        The upper balcony totally surrounds the vast interior of the building, and at several points bridges across from one side to the other. Little shops of all types run along the entire length of the balcony, and at each far end, stands the entrance arches for a large department store.        Most of the stores are gated, but several seem open. The big department stores are gated and locked. Here and there tall trees grow up from the ground floor and reach up into view of the second storey. There are none of the living dead evident on the balcony.204        The two troopers move slowly and quietly to the railing. The crouch and peer down through the bars of the rail. Below, the sight is even more spectacular.205        Stores of every type offer gaudy displays of consumer items.        Everything from clothing to appliances. Photo equipment; audio and video outlets; sporting goods and weaponry; gourmet foods and natural organic foods. There is a Book Store, a Record Store, a Real Estate Agency and a Bank; A Novelty Shop, a Gift Shop; all with the absolute latest in American consumer items. And at either end of the concourse like the main Altars at each end of a Cathedral, stand the mammoth two storey Department Stores; great symbols of a consumer society. Down the centre of the ground floor, along with the gardens and park benches, are little stalls. One is a Tobacco Specialist another Jewellery; another is a small Photo Portrait stall where mothers had their children photographed. There are restaurants and Snack Bars and numerous coin operated machines selling everything from children's toys to Blood Pressure readings. There is a large turntable, designed to spin but which is now still, holding a late model car on exhibit. Another turntable displays futuristic household appliances.        The images are all too familiar, but in their present state they appear as an archaeological discovery revealing the Gods and Customs of a civilisation now gone. The ghosts of a civilisation, however, are not figments in the mind. They are quite real. And they walk below in the aisles of the great Cathedral. At least twenty Zombies can be seen from the Troopers' perspective. 206        Roger:",

The creatures which wander the first floor look about, attracted by the sound, but they are confused. They walk this way and that, in mis-guided staggering strides.223        Several of the Zombies try to move up the down-escalator. They fall over themselves and cannot negotiate the moving stairway.224        A few creatures who move onto the up-escalator also fall against each other from the movement, but one falls onto the moving steps and is carried upward. Then another manages to keep its balance holding on to the hand rail. 225        At another point down the length of the mall, there is a stationary stairway which runs from the first to the second        floor.

Its body is preventing the gate from engaging in the floor mechanisms.        Roger lets go the cage as Peter tries to hold it against the creatures outside.

They begin to wander here and there. 262        Three of the creatures turn into the administrative corridor and start toward the offices. 263        Stephen has found a large binder in the desk. It contains all the plans for the mall, duplicating the charts on the walls and many others. It is a complete maintenance manual revealing all the workings and layout of the huge structure.264        Elevator doors slide open with a loud whoosh. The two Troopers appear in the car, wheeling their barrow out onto the second storey aisles of the big store.265        Now, they can see the roll gate and the creatures pushing at it ineffectively. They roll their barrow very close to the gate. When the Zombies catch sight of the humans, their efforts are renewed. They moan and push harder at the gate.266        They Troopers leave the barrow, disappearing back to the aisles.        They run onto the interior escalator, bounding down faster than the moving steps, then they run across the first floor until they see the lower level-roll gate.267        There are creatures wandering the concourse, but none of them        are at the gate.

Stephen then runs back down the interior corridor. 278        Stephen starts up the firestair to the door. Just then he hears Fran call out. Realising he will lead the creatures to her, he closes the door and moves toward the Maintenance office and runs in. 279        Stephen runs into the office and slams the door. 280        A second creature is moving up behind the first, and another enters the corridor from the accounting office. 281        The metal door locks only with a key. Stephen fumbles for a moment with his rifle, then dives for the key cabinet. There are hundreds of keys on rings. He looks at the wall map. He can't focus in his panic. 282        In the hall, the first creature slams against the floor. It doesn't even have the intelligence to reach for the knob. It pounds on the door with its hands. 283        The pounding increases Stephen's panic. He stares at the map trying to focus on the maze of numbers. 284        The second creature reaches the door and claws at it. The third approaches slowly. 285        Stephen rattles among the keys. His fingers shake and he cannot decipher the numbers. 286        Outside, one of the creatures, in its random clutching, takes hold of the knob and pushes in and out, not yet turning it. 287        Stephen, clutching one of the rings, throws himself against the door, still trying to read the numbers. The knob finally turns. The door opens against Stephen's weight. He manages to slam it shut despite the pushing creatures. He throws the key ring down and grabs his gun. 288        Roger speaks into his walkie talkie: Roger:",

Nearby lies the corpse of the first creature to break into the Maintenance Office. The third staggers into the room. Stephen stands fast now. He holds his rifle out in front of him. The creature walks toward the gun. Steve holds his hands on the trigger. The Zombie lunges suddenly, and grabs the gun barrel. Steve fires, but the blast tears through the creature's chest. Steve struggles to raise the barrel but the motion of the Zombie makes it impossible to aim accurately. The gun fires again, this time grazing the Zombie's neck. With a sudden burst of energy the creature wrenches the gun free. Steve backs against the wall. The creature tosses the rifle across the room where it slams the floor near a desk. The Zombie advances on Steve. Steve is next to the key cabinet and grabs at it, trying to find some weapon. He feels the tools in the cabinet and comes up with a hammer. The Zombie is about to reach him when Steve pulls the hammer out and upsets the cabinet. The Zombie fumbles with the cabinet at its feet, but doesn't fall. Steve tries to hit the creature's head with the tool, he misses and the Zombie grabs at his arm, trying to bite it. Steve wrenches free and the two bodies fall to the floor. The creature clutches at the man's legs, it's teeth bared like an animal. Steve kicks desperately and manages to land a blow squarely in the creatures face. The Zombie comes after him again and from his crawling position, Steve brings the hammer as an uppercut to the creature's jaw. The creature falls back enough for Steve to crawl across the floor. It follows, but Steve reaches the desk and grabs his rifle. Rolling on the floor, he fires several shots into the creature, finally destroying it. 302        The second floor gate rolls up with a rumble and Peter runs out of the Department Store with the barrow full of supplies. 303        The action attracts the attention of several of the creatures which are still wandering the balcony. They turn slowly. 304        Just as he rounds the corner. Peter almost collides with one creature, and can barely keep from upsetting the barrow. He manages to get past, and he runs as fast as he can toward the opening of the Administrative corridor. 305        Roger does not let the gate roll up too high. He stabilises the metal grid well within reach, then he stands his post with Peter's rifle. Several creatures approach from the opposite direction. Roger fires at the closest one. It falls. The others are still too far away to waste bullets. 306        Stephen steps over the corpses in the office and grabs the maintenance manual. He rushes into the corridor and runs out. 307        Three more creatures move toward him up the hallway. 308        At first Stephen freezes, then he starts backing toward the firestair, his rifle poised. 309        Just as Peter is reaching the mouth of the corridor, a Zombie        steps out of the hallway into his path. Peter slams the barrow squarely into the creature's legs. The Zombie falls in the barrow onto the supplies. The big man slams the load against a wall at the mouth of the corridor. Before the Zombie can get its balance, the big Trooper reaches down and grabs the creature's jacket lapels. With all his might he flings the creature out against the balcony railing. The creature flips over the rail, but does not fall. Its arms and legs flailing as Peter comes up quickly behind and flips it over the rail. The creature makes no sound as it plummets to the concourse below.310        Roger fires again at a Zombie drawing dangerously near. Other        creatures throughout the area are again converging on the Department Store entrance.311        Peter wheels the barrow into the corridor and sees Steve at the        other end, the three Zombies are still closing in.

She gets it against the door finally and moves to haul another. 352        The Zombie has reached the top landing and makes for the door. 353        Before the woman can bring another carton over, she sees the door move. She throws herself against it, but can't plant her feet well because of the carton of the floor. The door moves an inch at a time. The creature's hand reaches into the room. It clutches at the edge of the door. 354        Fran panics and runs back towards the escape pyramid, where she turns and faces the door. 355        The creature is straining against the weight of the carton. Now, now both its hands clutch the door edge. The carton moves another inch...and another. Now, the creature's head can be seen as it strains to get through the widening space. 356        Fran's eyes are wide, almost hypnotised. She looks for something to use as a weapon. The room is bare but for the cartons and water drums. She is about to opt for the skylight, when she glimpses Roger's knap-sack in the shadows. She runs for it as the creature finally breaks into the big room. 357        The woman's hands tremble as she rummages through the cloth sack. Nothing appropriate. She dumps the contents out: ammunition, mace cans, batteries, flares...flares! She nervously grabs one of the cylinders and her shaking hands try to deal with the paper wrapping. 358        The Zombie moans as it draws closer. It is approaching the pyramid of cartons. 359        Fran manages to free the wrapping, and snaps the cylinder in two at the mark. 360        Now the Zombie is between her and the pyramid, cutting off her immediate route. It is very near. Fran backs away a few steps as she tries to strike the flare head on the small striker on the cylinder cap. It doesn't fire...she tries again...and again. Now, the Zombie has reached the knap-sack. It kicks through the items and knocks and rolls the other flares. Fran's flare finally catches with a great whoosh, the bright flame startling the woman as well as the Zombie. The creature's eyes go wide and it brings its arms up to avoid the brightness. The intense white flame casts an eerie light over the creature and throws the Zombie's enormous shadow against the cartons and wall. The creature backs away a few steps almost tripping over the articles on the floor. Fran manages to advance close enough to snatch two extra cylinders and skirt around the Zombie in a wide arc. The creature swats the air, keeping distance, but threatening. Fran considers the firestair door, but decides on the pyramid. She circles around to a point where she can climb up from behind the moaning Zombie. She rushes for the cartons and climbs, but loses her footing while trying to hold the flares and crashes into the topmost carton. It starts to slide off the pyramid and tumbles to the floor almost crashing into the Zombie. The creature starts to clutch at the pyramid. The stack of cartons is now too short and Fran can reach the skylight but can't pull herself up. She accidentally drops two flares, including the lit one. It tumbles to the floor behind the pyramid where it no longer offends the Zombie's eye's. Now the creature tries to climb to the woman. Fran grabs the last flare in her mouth and reaches with both hands for the skylight. She lifts with all her might and her feet come off the cartons but she cannot pull herself up. As she tries to lower her feet back to the cartons, the pyramid shakes and wobbles from the Zombie. The creature is making progress; its hands can almost touch Fran's foot. 361        Peter drops out of a ceiling grid into a plush office. Roger's legs appear through the grid and he too swings down, holding on with his hands to soften his landing. Suddenly, we are aware of a third person on the room in the large chair at the desk. Roger startles and grabs his gun. Peter just stares. They are in the President's office. Some days earlier, the President, shot himself in the head. Peter:",

There are soaps, toiletries, pens, pencils, and notebooks, flashlights, cigarettes and several decks of cards with a canister of chips. The items are clearly not all functional.

Stephen hovers overhead in the chopper, following the trucks as closely as he can. 403        On the roof of the mall, Fran clutches her rifle. She sees the big trucks roar up over the hill, the helicopter just above them. It is a strange looking convoy as it speeds toward the trucks as closely as it can. 404        Along the road, several Zombies try to stagger after the trucks but they are left in the dust of the speeding vehicles. The creatures lumber along slowly behind. 405        The vehicles pull into the little grade which loads into the mall's parking lot. They roar right toward the building. 406        At one of the building entrances, a cluster of Zombies is moving in and lot of the main doors. Others wander nearby in the parking lot. Attracted by the sounds of the engines, the creatures turn and face the trucks. As Peter pulls his vehicle in a wide arc, Roger drives his right up to the side of the building and roars toward the entrance doors. Then he skips his right wheels up onto the curb, and with a great, scraping crunch, the big truck pulls directly abreast of the building, flush with the entrance. The huge vehicle crushes several of the helpless creatures and knocks other flying back. 407        The trailer of the truck has totally blocked off the mall entrance. Several Zombies trapped inside try to push the glass doors open. The doors move, but cannot be opened wide enough for the creatures to get out. 408        The few creatures immediately around the truck begin clambering at its sides. Roger shuts off the engine and grabs his gun as other Zombies begin clutching at the windows of the cab. 409        Overhead, the whirlybird hovers very close by. Now Peter's big truck pulls up alongside so that Peter's passenger door is directly abreast of the free door on Roger's cab. Peter's truck also crushes one or two of the creatures, but there are still several in the immediate vicinity of the cab. 410        As Roger opens his door and scrambles into the other truck, one of the Zombies grabs hold. Roger just manages to kick the creature off as the big truck pulls out and roars across the lot. 411        The helicopter flies straight up and directly over the roof of the big shopping centre, where Fran has been watching the action. She now runs to the other side of the roof, the wind from the chopper whipping her hair. 412        The chopper turns and waits for the big truck to move up under it, then the whirlybird escorts the trailer back to the warehouse down the road. 413        Roger is whooping and hollering like a cowboy as the big rig pulls up beside another of the parked vans.

Roger grabs his knapsack and climbs into the new cab where he immediately goes to work on jumping the engine cables. 414        From the helicopter overhead, Stephen spots something moving around the warehouse. He jockeys the chopper slightly for a better look and he sees a small group of Zombies wandering out of the big garage directly toward Roger's truck. 415        In the meantime, Peter's truck pulls away from the cab Roger is in. The big vehicle rolls into the large paved area behind the warehouse where Peter can turn it around easily. 416        Stephen swoops down with the big bird. He buzzes as close as he can to Roger's truck, trying to signal the man. 417        Roger continues to work on the cables, still whooping like a child. The Zombies are very close at hand. They have just about reached the cab. Stephen buzzes again. Roger doesn't notice. 418        Peter has now backed up into a position which enables him to pull out. He looks up to see the helicopter heading straight for him. 419        The big chopper buzzes right over Peter's cab then spins around heading back for Roger. 420        Peter looks toward the other truck. He can now see the lumbering creatures. He tries to slam the truck into gear, but the complicated shift mechanism fights him. 421        One Zombie slams its hands against the driver-side window of Roger's truck. The man startles and tries to untangle himself from his cramped position under the big steering wheel. He is stuck for a moment. The other creatures appear at the passenger side of the cab, where the door is open. One grabs at Roger's legs. Roger kicks violently, but can't get a good position. He falls lower onto the floor of the cab, his body almost knotted among the controls and the shift sticks. 422        Peter's truck starts to roll, but it accelerates slowly. 423        The helicopter tries to buzz the clutching ghouls, but they do not even flinch. The wind from the propeller blades whip at the creatures' hair, making them look even more frightening as they claw at the desperate Roger. 424        The man kicks and kicks, but he cannot deliver a solid blow from his pinned position. His hand gropes on the seat of the truck for his rifle, which suddenly fires as the man's fingers inadvertently hit the trigger. A shell blasts through the chest of the lead creature, but the thing pays little attention. 425        Peter's truck is starting to roll faster. He heads right for Roger's cab. 426        The helicopter hovers as Stephen tries to see the action. 427        Now Roger has a good grip on his gun, but he cannot clear the long weapon from around the gear sticks. The lead Zombie is actually scrambling into the cab and is all but on top of the struggling Trooper. 428        The second creature is about to claw its way in when, with a great roar, Peter's truck swings up and crushes it. 429        Roger is desperately trying to keep the other Zombie's mouth away. They are wrestling now. The Zombie is weak, as usual, but Roger is still hampered by the position he is in. 430        Peter has pulled too far past the other truck. He slams his rig into reverse and backs up. Now his window is in a direct line with the open door on Roger's cab. He raises his rifle and aims, but he cannot get a clear shot. He shouts loudly trying to overcome the noise of the truck engine and the hovering helicopter. Peter:",

It's fingers push at the man's eyes. 432        Peter sees the opportunity and fires. The gun roars loudly. 433        The Zombie's head flies apart. Remnants of blood and brain tissue splatter the inside of the cab and the driver's window. The gummy stuff flies into Roger's face. The Zombie falls limp, but Roger is still desperate. The dead weight of the creature is now on top of him, and the bloody wound runs. Roger is frantic. He frees himself with great heaves of his body and he pushes the creature out of the cab. The man's eyes are wide with revulsion. He instantly brings up his sleeve to wipe the stains from his face. He is quivering in extremes of emotions. A sudden crash. Roger spins.

The music continues through the entire action. 448        Roger steers his giant vehicle directly broadside to the doors. The cab knocks over several creatures and scrapes the building as the trailer blocks off the entrance. This time there are still creatures alive in the immediate area. They clutch at the cab of the truck and leap at the doors. 449        Fran, watching from directly above, seems inspired, caught up in the bravery of the moment. As she sees the creatures converging on the truck, she aims her rifle at them. Before she fires, Peter's rig slides next to Roger's, cabs abreast. 450        Peter's truck knocks over several of the clutching creatures. One Zombie, caught directly under the front wheels, is still alive and clutching at the air. Several creatures jump at Peter's driver side window. 451        Roger, grabbing his gun, moves to leave his truck on Peter's side, but the trucks are too close. His door won't open enough to get out. He rolls down his window.

He guns the engine and roars into a big arcing turn in the parking lot. 463        When Fran sees the truck returning, she looks up from her gun sight. The helicopter has already flown over the roof, and Stephen is confused as to why the truck hadn't appeared on the road. Fran turns and tries to signal to Stephen. 464        He finally sees her and flies closer. The woman waves a signal and the chopper buzzes back over the lot. 465        Her hair blowing wildly, Fran takes up her post again, her rifle ready. She thinks a moment, then begins to reload the weapon pulling the shells from her blouse pocket. 466        Peter's truck zooms back into position, colliding with some of Zombies in the vicinity. 467        Roger immediately climbs through the windows into the original cab. He snatches up his knapsack and several tools which are strewn over the seat and floor. Again, creatures converge on the cab area. Two more come up between the trucks, several come around the front of the cab. 468        Fran is still loading. 469        The helicopter buzzes. 470        As Roger climbs back through the window, his pack accidentally falls to the ground. With reflex action, he drops between the cabs, landing on his feet. He is facing the two creatures which are very close. He reaches up and with on hand on each of the open window frames, he swings his legs up hard. His kick sends the creatures sprawling. Then, he bends to collect his pack and is grabbed from behind. 471        Peter tries to level off his gun but he cannot get a shot. 472        Neither can Fran who is shouting from the roof. 473        Roger keeps his head this time. His first thought is for the pack of tools. He tosses the sack into the cab of Peter's truck as though he were making a hook shot with a basketball. 474        Peter catches the pack as several of the tools clatter out and onto the floor of the cab. 475        The creature which has a hold on Roger takes advantage of the man's imbalance from throwing the knapsack. It bites at the man's arm. Roger tears away, but blood appears at the wound. Then Roger squares off a solid punch right to the Zombie's jaw. The creature flies back and almost knocks over the Zombies behind it. Roger jumps, making a grab for the window of Peter's cab. The Zombies between the trucks, which Roger originally kicked away, have regrouped. They advance and grab at the struggling trooper. Roger's feet try to get hold on the side of the door, but they slip. 476        Peter moves to drop his rifle and grab Roger's hands, but Roger falls from the high window back to the pavement. Peter draws his hand gun. 477        Roger leaps again, his hands catching the window frame. The Zombies are clutching at him. Again he swings up his legs and kicks the creatures off balance. This time he manages to get his feet locked against the door and Peter grabs the Troopers arm with his free hand, but another Zombie is pulling at the man's shirt and still another makes a grab for his legs. Peter reaches out with his pistol and fires a point blank shot at one of the clutching ghouls. It flies back and Roger is able to pull himself higher. His torso is just about through the window when another creature grabs him. 478        Peter can no longer get a shot as Roger fills the window, so the big man drops his pistol and pulls Roger's arm with all his might. 479        Roger is almost all the way in but his legs still dangle, kicking. Peter starts the truck. As it begins to roll away, one of the clutching Zombies is able to get a solid hold on Roger's left leg. The creature opens its mouth and bites at the calf. Blood appears. The creature bites again and this time it comes away with bits of flesh tangled in a bloodstained strip op material from Roger's trousers. 480        Roger screams in pain and kicks violently. The truck accelerates and the Zombie finally falls clear. 481        It rolls on the pavement for a little way before it stops. Then it sits on the ground, looking like a gorilla. It still has a bloody mass of flesh and material in its mouth. With its hands it tries to separate the cloth from the more important morsels. A bullet pings into the cement near the chewing Zombie. Another tears through its shoulder. It still is concerned only with its prize. 482        Fran is firing, swearing through her teeth as the gun roars. She finally hits the seated creature squarely in the head. 483        We see it fall from her point of view on the roof. Others walk by the corpse without taking notice. 484        The helicopter escorts the big truck back to the warehouse. 485        As it rumbles along, Roger, in extreme pain, is tying his belt tightly around his leg as a tourniquet. He sucks air through his teeth in anguish. Peter:",

They clutch and claw at the enormous vehicles but to no avail. Some try to climb up onto the cabs. Others try to claw at the doors on the trailers. 488        Some creatures are crawling under the rigs: When they reach the mall doors they cannot stand, so they have no leverage. The creatures inside are pushing the doors out, so the Zombies under the trucks cannot push them in. The doors swing both in and out, so it is very clear that some access could be had by the creatures if they were more organised. One creature, having crawled under a trailer, does manage to push open a mall door. The thing crawls into the building through the legs of other ghouls which are trying to exit. They behave as a swarm of insects. The revolving door offers the best access for the creatures, although its inherent complexity is baffling to their empty brains. Two creatures do manage to crawl under the truck which blocks the revolving door, and one of them negotiates the rotating action and enters the concourse. 489        Peter and Stephen are huddled over the maps of the building.

The gate to the mall balcony is open on this store. Another creature, attracted by the commotion, starts through the open entrance arch. 493        Stephen is starting down through the ceiling grid. He also has equipment strapped onto his body. He sees the charging creature. Peter is trying to unsling his rifle. Stephen conquers his fear of the height, and lets himself fall to the floor. He crumples up when he hits, and rolls into a store exhibit, knocking things flying. Peter manages to level off his gun and shoots the rushing creature. Stephen regains his footing. The second creature is moving up the aisle. Stephen grabs a powerful crossbow from a nearby exhibit. It is loaded. It fires with a strumming sound and the small shaft rips cleanly through the creature's skull and imbeds itself in a wall beyond. The Zombie walks forward a few steps before it falls. 494        The men run toward the entrance arch. Leaping up on an adjacent counter top, Peter manages to reach the lip of the roll gate and he swings it down fast. Stephen catches the cage below and slams it into place just as another ghoul falls against it moaning and clawing. Stephen unslings his gun and is about to level it off on the creature outside.

They all wear new double holsters containing hand guns. Each has a rifle strapped over his shoulder and another in hand. They wear ammo belts and carry packs with other supplies. The wounded Roger is sitting in the big gardening cart which Peter earlier used to carry the first supply load out of the store. Peter runs, pushing the cart before him. There are only a few creatures on the balcony. The dead things turn in confusion at the sound of the attacking commandos. Roger, his hands free to shoot, fires his weapon several times at some of the creatures who are closest. 501        The creatures from the main concourse below begin to move up the stationary staircase and struggle with the escalators. The corpses of creatures slain in the earlier battles still clutters in the area. 502        Fran and Steve are the first to reach the entrance to the Department Store. Steve falls immediately on the gate locks. Peter pulls up to a screeching halt at the gate. He turns the cart in a full 180 so that Roger is facing out toward the mall. Steve fumbles with the second lock. Peter faces the few Zombies which are converging along the balcony. He lift his new Super-gun and stares through the scope. The gun roars eloquently. Even its sound pronounces its power. The single shot rips cleanly through the centre-forehead of one of the creatures. The man aims at another head. Blam. Another perfect kill. Then a third. Roger fires several times. Fran stands ready at the roll gate. As Stephen finishes with the final lock, the woman pushes against the cage and it starts up. Steve stands, and the two roll the cage into the ceiling, but Stephen is careful not to let it get out of his grasp. Fran moves into the store and Peter pulls the cart behind him. Then Steve, Peter and Fran pull the gate shut long before any of the advancing creatures reach the area. 503        Again, the Zombies smash into the cage, but the humans are already running through the aisles of the big store. 504        Peter wheels Roger into the elevator and hits the button for the first floor. The doors shut and the car starts down. Peter:",

Roger manages to control it, and the shiny vehicle zooms ahead with tremendous energy. 539        One of the stray creatures in the concourse tries to intercept the speeding auto, but the car knocks him mercilessly aside as though he were a bowling pin. 540        Fran sees the car as it rounds the corner, heads directly for the main entrance which she can see from her position. 541        The Zombies at the entrance already started back into the mall attracted by the commotion. The car zooms down the concourse easily breaking their ranks. 542        Roger throws the manoeuvrable vehicle into a screeching tailspin, stopping just at the doors. 543        The big trailer blocks the entrance effectively. There are some creatures inside the doors. Under the van, several Zombies are struggling with the doors. one is just pushing in and seems as though it will be able to enter. 544        Peter and Stephen slam against the door. Stephen aims his torch directly at the crawling creatures. The one in front withdraws its arm. The grotesque things writhe, kick under the truck. The door slams and Peter produces another set of master keys. They are all coded. he falls on the lock mechanism. Peter:",

The face is magnified, distorted by the telescope. The gun roars and the head in the scope explodes with red. 553        The creature falls against a column, hit squarely through the brain. We sense the supreme accuracy of the magnificent weapon. 554        It is night. The Zombies in the parking lot still group around the semis. They set up an eerie moaning in the moonlight. A slow piece of music starts to build. 555        The creatures crawl under the trucks but cannot enter the mall. They pound and scratch at the doors, to no avail. 556        From inside the concourse, the mob is muffled. Even the revolving door is locked now. It seems the most vulnerable, but the crawling creatures cannot quite get leverage to smash the glass panels and they have no tools to pound with. The auto is flush against the revolving doors inside, offering added protection. Several alarm units sit atop the car. They are the early warning devices against penetration. 557        They camera starts to dolly back, the music builds. We see slain corpses of many Zombies lying askew in various parts of the building. It is like a battlefield after a war. 558        The humans appear on the second storey balcony. Moving to the railing, looking down to the expanse of the building. They are guerrilla fighters, with their weapons strapped on. They have taken the Temple. The music hits a crescendo as the people look over their spoils. Even the wounded Roger seems triumphant as he limps to the rails, supporting himself on his arms. 559        We see a spectacular shot of the full expanse of the building.

The corpses lie askew, their arms and legs protruding. The stacks of money are upset by the limp action of the bodies as they roll around. 580        A finger flips a switch and we hear the mall music start up slowly. 581        We see a montage: Fran, Stephen and Peter walk slowly through the conquered building. They drift in and out of stores picking up various items. They use shopping carts. 582        Fran rummages idly through the cosmetic department. 583        Peter looks through a book store. 584        Stephen plays the pinball machines in a huge game room. 585        Peter tries on big colourful hats in front if a mirror. 586        Fran trims Stephen's hair as he sits in the mechanical chair of the mall Barber Shop. 587        Fran feeds the animals in the Pet Store, then with a bag of seed, she feeds the Tropical Birds in the tall cage out on the concourse. The birds flutter, flap about, screeching loudly. 588        Now the group walk along the upper balcony. They look down. They still have their weapons and kits, Peter is wearing a wide brimmed hat and Fran sports a new mink coat. 589        The concourse is empty now of corpses, but the group can hear the moaning and thumping at the main entrances. It is dark outside, the creatures claw at the doors but cannot be seen in the shadows under the big trailer trucks. The sound evidences their presence, however. 590        The people stand at the balcony railing overlooking their realm. Fran:",

Fran rushes into the other room. 592        The space is starting to look like living quarters. There is furniture. There are sectioned off areas with things still packed in cartons, but it is beginning to look like home. 593        The woman rushes to the medical supply area which is now more organised with little cabinets and a small refrigerator. She takes a new vial of serum from the freezer. 594        Downstairs, Peter is checking the covering at the floor base of the fake wall. He hears the violent screaming from above. 595        He climbs up a rope ladder in the ceiling, scrambles through the grill in the ceiling, enters the duct. Then he pulls up the ladder and closes the grill. 596        He crawls through the tight space for a few feet, and drops out of another grill into the washroom. 597        He moves through the internal corridor and into the firestair. 598        All the while, Roger's screaming can be heard. Peter tramps up the stairs several at a time. 599        He rushes through the living space in the direction of the screams. 600        Fran is withdrawing a hypodermic from Roger's good arm. The man still thrashes wildly. Steve is struggling to hold him. Peter rushes in and helps. Fran drifts out of the room. After a short time Roger relaxes somewhat. Peter:        (to Steve) GO ON...I'LL STAY WITH HIM. Steve leaves the area. 601        In the living spaces, Fran is sitting in a chair. It is the inflatable kind, which can be collapsed like a balloon. Steve comes up to her and puts his arms around her neck from behind. She cups his hands with hers and holds them tightly. She stares off across the room. 602        Roger catches his breath and looks up at Peter. He licks his lips and tries to speak coherently. Roger:",

She carries it through the room and drops it on some papers laid out in an unused part of the storage area. Fran's stomach is big now, her pregnancy evident. She wipes her brow like an exhausted housewife, and shuffles back into the living area. She fumbles with the sheets on the double mattress which she and Steve obviously share. There is an end table near the bed, with a reading light. Books lie strewn around, along with magazines and half drunk cups of coffee. 615        In the sitting room, we see a scene which could be comfortable suburban. The furniture is neatly arranged. There is a small portable stove which operates on bottled gas, a refrigerator, and cabinets with dishes and silverware. 616        There is a modern calendar on the wall, which has three months crossed off. There are a variety of radio and TV units and a stereo record player. There are even decorations: paintings hung, knick knacks on the tables. The room almost looks like a wealthy man's den, with all the gadget-oriented affluence. 617        In the Department Store, Stephen wanders about. He fiddles with a new supersonic calculator and he looks at adult games. 618        On the roof, in the bright sun of early morning, Peter plays tennis against one of the shed walls. He's dressed in a new sweat suit with brightly coloured Addidas sneakers. He has a sleek new racquet, slamming phosphorescent balls with all his might. His face is set in what is almost anger. He attacks each shot with determination and emotion. 619        One of his shots misses the shed. The ball bounces and banks off the lip of the roof, then it tumbles over the edge. 620        In the parking lot below, the ball hits the pavement. It bounces several times, rolling off among the feet of the army of Zombies wandering this way and that through the area. 621        The creatures mob around the trucks at the main entrances. They moan and gurgle, clawing at the building. There seem to be hundreds of them, all different ages, sexes, shapes. Some clothed, some naked, some wounded, some almost untouched. 622        Now Fran, the pregnant housewife, is cooking supper. 623        The men play cards with hundred dollar bills in the living space. 624        The three sit around the dinner table, just finishing their supper.

The roar of the cycles can be heard in the distance. 639        Reaching the roof's edge, Peter stares off at the horizon, but sees nothing. The thunder draws nearer. Peter tries binoculars. 640        Through the lenses are vague shapes in the darkness. As the sound swells, we see the riders.

She squeals back to the main biker group. 650        The Zombies in the parking lot are approaching the ranks of motorcycles from a good distance. The raiders open fire. They, too, possess sophisticated weapons, the barrage sets up a great noise. Several creatures fall. The little van pulls up behind the bikes. The men still whoop and shout. 651        On the floor on the mall, Peter and Steve dash about slamming roll gates down on the open stores. They run desperately through the empty concourses. They hear the din from outside. 652        At the trailer cab, a raider fires point blank at the Zombies that claw at the passenger window. Another man checks cables. Raider:",

Ghouls at windows. 653        Inside, the men hear the truck starting. Steve slams down the Pharmacy gate. Peter is already running to the Department Store. The big Trooper crashes up the escalator to the second floor aisles. Steve breaks for the open Hardware Store. 654        The huge trailer rolls away from the mall entrance. A shout of victory goes up from the raiders. The Zombies at the door do not yet enter the mall, their focus on the raiders now. From other entrances Zombies start converging on the parking lot. 655        Across the lot, the bikers rev their engines ready to make a run on the building. The raiders in the truck hop from the cab. They run to the doors, shooting Zombies at they move. Some creatures fall, others claw at the runners. One raider is brought down by the ghouls. His friends pay no attention. 656        One gunman slams into the mall doors to find they are locked. He levels his machine gun on the locks and rips open the mechanism. The men push through the doors. The little alarm units are knocked flying sending out a high pitched signal. 657        Peter is just slamming down the gates on the balcony when he hears the alarms go off. 658        One of the raiders hears the gates rumbling. He looks up and sees Peter running by the railing upstairs. He fires with his machine gun. 659        Peter dives, sliding across the balcony. The bullets miss him and he crawls around the balcony just out of sight from below. 660        Steve has just slammed down the Hardware Store gate, and makes a dash for the Department Store. 661        The raiders spot him as well, and open fire. 662        Steve runs zip-zag and dives into the big store, where he ducks into the shadows leaving the gate open. 663        Peter, at the balcony railing, levels his super-gun on the bikers. 664        One accurate shot fires and a raider falls with a giant wound in his chest. 665        The last raider at the doors ducks out of Peter's sight. 666        Steve now charges the roll gate and slams it shut on the store. 667        The bikers toward the building. Zombies scatter on the lot. 668        Just as the bikers are reaching the building, the raider inside rushes the doors. He holds them open as the big fleet of rumbling cycles comes screaming into the building. 669        Steve is in awe, watching from the Department Store grid. 670        The cycles pull down the concourse and Zombies lumber in after them. The raider at the door is grabbed by a Zombie. Then another. He manages to fight away. 671        Peter, shooting above, downs the raider and one of the ghouls. 672        The main band of bikers hear the gunfire and pull down a side concourse to regroup. They make their turn close to the Department Store and Steve backs into he shadows. 673        Peter moves down the balcony as Zombies are clamouring back to the big concourses. Peter's eyes are wide at the invasion. 674        Upstairs, Fran hears the noises. She is at the top of the firestair, weapons ready. On the landing below, the puppy scamper and barks. Fran calls the dog, but it doesn't listen. 675        The bikes arc around and several pull up to the Dept. Store. Raider:",

Below, she hears the puppy still barking. She starts carefully down the steps. 684        In the stuck elevator, Steve gropes and fumbles for his talk box. Steve:",

Store, raiding the counters and raping the displays. They throw things into sacks while others move to different stores and shoot off roll gate locks. They raid the arsenal in the Sporting Goods store. 688        The main pack of bandits are holding off the Zombies. The creatures charge with new vigour. Some raiders fall and the ghouls pounce on them, ripping flesh with teeth and hands. 689        The van pulls up outside the doors and two bikers ride out to it, loading supplies into it. The Zombies are everywhere, but the actions of the professional looters befuddle them. 690        Several creatures move onto the balcony. One Zombie pounces the raider Peter shot and tears at his body. 691        As remaining raiders appear at the mouth of the corridor, Peter opens fire, killing the lead raider with a clean shot in the heart. The man flies back over the railing, falling to the concourse below where Zombies attack it. The other raider falls back against the wall. 692        Peter dashes into the Maintenance Room and rushes to throw the emergency power switch. 693        The portable emergency light units blink on all over the mall. 694        Steve, who has crawled through the escape hatch of the elevator, suddenly feels the car move. He grabs onto the cables but his hands slip from grease and his rifle falls down and wedges between the wall of the shaft and the moving car. Suddenly, the car stops again, and Steve sees through the escape hatch as light spills in as the main elevator doors open. He thinks to jump down, but hears raiders below. 695        Two of the big, greasy bandits charge into the car. They whoop and shout as they see the open escape hatch. 696        Steve settles back out of sight against the wall. 697        Raider:",

The other raider whoops loudly and fires a barrage of bullets into the escape hatch. 698        The shells bang and clatter in the shaft and ricochet off the walls and gears. A shell nicks Stephen's arm, but he is silent. 699        Finally, the barrage stops. The raiders charge back to the store. 700        Other bandits battle with Zombies. The men crash through stores, collecting weapons, ammunition, tools, clothes, food. 701        Bikers shuttle goods out to the side doors of the van. The woman in the front seat is ready with giant pistols. Zombies try to pound their way in, but they cannot succeed. 702        In the mall, another biker drops to the Zombies. They pounce on him and start devouring his screaming body. 703        Several creatures now wander through the Department Store, having entered from the second storey gate. They move through aisles knocking against displays. One grabs a mannequin thinking it human, throws the dummy aside roughly. 704        The raider on the balcony is approached by several Zombies. He runs down the corridor to the Maintenance office. Peter is gone. Breaking into the various empty offices, the raider comes to the fake wall panel and assumes it goes nowhere. Then he hears the faint barking of the dog. He checks the panel again by running his hand along the edge. Suddenly a sound in the corridor and the raider turns. There are three ghouls coming. He fires and knocks off the ghouls one at a time and runs onto the balcony. 705        Bikes roar this way and that. It is a war zone. 706        The man is about to run downstairs when he hears a noise above. He spins and looks up. He sees Peter just too late. 707        The big Trooper, in an open ceiling grid, aims his super-gun squarely at the raider's head. The gun roars and the man flies. 708        Below, the raiders are starting to regroup. The bikes begin to peel out of the mall entrance one at a time. 709        Another raider is snatched off his machine by the Zombies. 710        The bikers toss a last bit of booty in the van and the woman driver gets ready to pull out. She lowers her window and fires point blank at the heads of the clutching creatures. 711        The last wave of raiders is at the first floor entrance. The Zombies are mobbing around the bikes outside. The men shoot and beat their way to the cycles. One man is brought down, but three manage to mount their cycles. The big bikes roar out. 712        Peter is crawling through the ductwork. Just as he opens a grid, he sees the last bike rolling across the concourse. He levels off with his scope. 713        He shoots one raider out of the saddle. Two others get out. 714        Regrouping in the lot, the band of twenty is now seven or eight. 715        One last cyclist revs his engine and roars through the concourse. He dodges several ghouls and heads for the entrance. He is the leader. The one who was on the radio. He whoops victorious just as he is about to drive through the doors. 716        Peter leans out of the grid work and settles the cross-hairs on the back of the riders head. He waits as the biker roars out onto the lot. The rider lets out one last victorious shout in the fresh air. Peter's scope is locked on the riders back and the super-gun roars. The biker is blown off his machine. 717        The bike flies into a pack of Zombies. Some fall back, but others advance on the rider. The man rolls over the cement, stops, not dead yet. He screams wildly as they move onto him. 718        The other bikers move off in the night and the engines fade away. 719        The puppy stops barking. Fran is tense in the darkness clutching her rifle. She stands on the now silent landing. 720        In the parking lot and main concourse the Zombies move freely. They fight over the remains of the corpses. They eat ravenously, the sounds of their feast the only thing in the area. 721        Peter peers down at the slaughter below from the ductwork. Suddenly he hears the beeper of his talk unit, hits the button. Steve:",

He sees the grid in the shaft wall. 723        Suddenly, the car doors open on the second storey and abruptly several Zombies dart into the car. They claw at Steve's legs and pull him out of the hatch. He screams, thrashes violently. 724        In the duct, Peter hears the screams. He stops and listens for a moment. He backs away heading for the Maintenance corridor. 725        In the elevator, Steve thrashes with all his might. The ghouls try to pull him out of the car while the elevator doors open and close repeatedly against the creatures which block it. A Zombie bites Steve's arm, another bites his neck. The man scrambles to unholster his gun. Although he is bleeding profusely, he finally pulls his gun and fires...once...twice... 726        Peter is dropping out of the washroom duct. He hears the pistol shots and realises Steve is not dead. He thinks about climbing back in the grid, but stops. He punches at the wall violently. He is angry and confused. 727        Again the pistol roars and rips through a Zombie head, flying out of the elevator. The doors still slam against the last creature and Steve fires. The Zombie flies back and the doors finally close. 728        Outside, Zombies fall against the elevator doors. 729        Inside, Steve falls to the floor. His neck runs red. His eyes are wide with terror. He sits stupidly staring at the pistol in his hand. He finds it hard to breathe. 730        Peter appears at the bottom of the firestair.
