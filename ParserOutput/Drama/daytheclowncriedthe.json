At intervals of about twenty-five yards, in the area between the fences, are the guard towers, each about eighteen feet above the ground equipped with searchlights, sirens, machine guns, with three Guards on duty.  Along outer fence, also about twenty-five yards apart, other powerful lighting equipment mounted on high poles. It is morning and although the sun shines brightly it doesn't in any way alter the drabness of the compound... nor does it help change the look of the men... There are about three hundred men milling about, some still chewing what was their breakfast, some pulling brown bread from their shirt fronts and exchanging bread for cigarettes or just making deals, one with another... some sit along the barracks walls trying to get some sun... others walking in circles... some talking, laughing, even playing cards... doing whatever they can to kill time...",

LUDWIG, once a fairly prosperous businessman before his politics landed him in prison, is older, and his bitterness is written all over his face.  FRANZ, is the youngest.  He is a sensitive looing twenty five year old, more than likely the \"rebel\" type of the 1930s. Helmut is in his upper bunk over Keltner writing on an old piece of paper with a scruffy pencil, which he bites to make a point of, and wets with his tongue like any fat butcher selling liverwurst and marking the price on a brown paper bag... (i.e. Brooklyn, circa 1928). We TRUCK the CAMERA down the long barrack to include the other men doing their things.  A couple of men are getting ready for a card game... several others are comparing clothing, mending and helping one another, a couple play chess.  A few are sleeping, but for the most part, most of the men lay in their bunks staring at the ceiling... The floors are spotless... suffice to say they better be... the walls have nothing hanging but a few socks drying... a torn calendar, wrong year, etc.",

Behind him, also at a safe distance because they still aren't certain of the official reaction to all of this, a number of his fellow political prisoners are watching his antics.  But, in spite of his talk about the importance of playing to the adults -- it is the children that Helmut plays to -- and it is for their laughter that he listens. The CAMERA MOVES IN to -- MED. FULL SHOT - HELMUT And we see that he has used the chalk to whiten his face. With charcoal he has blackened his eyebrows, formed a wide black mouth and drawn lines down over his eyelids to his cheekbones, giving him the appearance of a clown at once sad and happy.  At the moment he is coatless, but Franz's coast lies nearby on the ground.  For the stunt he is doing now Helmut carries the remains of an old broom and a piece of cardboard.  He is trying to sweep a small heap of dirt he has gathered onto the cardboard, but each time he tries, the dirt goes over the cardboard and he must sweep it into a pile again.  After a few attempts he feigns exasperation and ponders the problem.  Inspiration comes.  He sweeps the dirt into a pile again, bends over and very carefully sweeps it into the front of one of his shoes, holding up the split top to let it in.  This accomplished, he is very proud of himself, but when he tries to take a step, some of the dirt comes out.  Frustrated, he ponders again, and again has an inspiration.  He removes the shoe and puts it under his arm. But as he walks away with it, all the dirt slides out through the open toe.  The children roar with delight.",

He is trying very hard not to laugh.  The result is a self-conscious giggle. As the laughter grows even louder, the CAMERA PANS as though wafted on the waves of laughter, up to a guardtower, and we see two rifle-armed soldiers in the tower watching the performance below them.

The CAMERA PULLS BACK so that Helmut is in f.g.   He slides the boxcar door open fully, throwing more light on the children.  This brings renewed walls of anguish from the youngsters, who cluster together more fiercely.  But one little boy sneaks a look at the door, expecting to see more guards.  When he sees Helmut, his tear- filled eyes widen.  He can scarcely believe what he sees, much less verbalize it.  He tugs frantically at an OLDER GIRL he has been clutching.  She looks first at him, then at Helmut.  She, too, can hardly believe it.",

But suddenly a little dark haired, dark- eyed girl of about six, sits upright and cries out, frightened by a bad dream.  Helmut reacts.  The child looks around the boxcar as if she can't remember how she got there and begins crying inconsolably.  Some of the other children stir.  Helmut quickly but carefully disengages himself from the tots around him and picks his way over to the girl.

It is hardly a masterpiece, but it has the desired effect. The girl stops sobbing, and when Helmut finishes the tune he makes a real funny face and she timorously puts a hand up to touch his make-up, but pulls it back quickly.  With an affectionate smile, Helmut takes her hand and runs it over his face, pretending that her touch tickles him.  As he laughs, the child begins to smile faintly.  He shows her the traces of chalk make-up on her fingers, and she giggles. His conquest is all but complete.  He picks the youngster up, and holding her like a dancing partner, pretends to dance with her to a little tune he hums.  She loves this and laughs outright.  When Helmut finally puts her down, he kisses her on the cheek and turns his cheek in an unspoken request for a return kiss.  The girl shyly and quickly gives Helmut's cheek a peck.  Grinning, Helmut pats the spot where she kissed him to show his appreciation for her wonderful gift.",

Helmut is asleep on the floor with the children huddled around him.  He lies on his side with one arm thrown protectively over the little Czech girl, Inga, and Willie.  Behind him, the Czech birthday boy and the girl with the doll are cuddled close to him.  Other youngsters have their heads on his legs and feet, and all are as close to him as they can get. He is, in fact, a sort of human bed.  From the train NOISES o.s. we can tell that the freight train is slowing down. Then, with a jolt, it stops, and o.s. we HEAR a truck engine approaching.  Helmut stirs and sits up, trying to get his bearings.  This arouses some of the children and they too sit up and look around.",

As they gather around him, they take up his soft laugh, timidly at first, then more assuredly until the chamber resounds with gentle laughter.",
