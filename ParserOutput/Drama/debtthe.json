She glances up at Vogel, checking him. He is still slumped, eyes closed. We TRACK with her as she walks back into the kitchen. From the living room comes the three distinct PINGS of rainwater dripping in the pots. She drops the pieces of bowl into the bin and stops, puzzled. It's a moment before she works out what she's noticed - something has changed in the sound of the rainwater next door. There only two drips instead of three. She walks back towards the living room... RACHEL'S P.O.V - through the living room door we can see that one of the pots has been overturned. Rachel slows to a stop. A sudden wave of adrenalin causes her to turn but...it's too late. Vogel steps out of the alcove he's been standing in so that he is directly in front of her. Before she can even cry out he has slashed her face open with a SHARD OF GLASS. Instinctively she cups her hands to her ripped face. Vogel grabs her by the hair and stepping behind her, tries to worm his other hand underneath her raised arms to reach her throat with the glass. Her training kicking in, Rachel uses a krav magah move to grab and twist Vogel's forearm, breaking his hold on her and turning the arm until, with a yell of pain, Vogel drops the shard. He swings wildly at her, but Rachel ducks the fist and drives the palm of her hand up into his face. Vogel stumbles back, surprised by her speed and the sudden pain of the blow. Rachel is about to press home the attack but is blinded by blood from her wound washing into her eyes. As she wipes her eyes clear, Vogel grabs a LAMP from a small chest of drawers in the hall and smashes it into her face. She falls. Vogel begins to run, but, driven by adrenaline and desperation, Rachel scrambles onto all fours and lunges at him, catching hold of his trouser leg as he moves towards the front door. Vogel stumbles, manages to pull a leg free and stamps down on Rachel who lets go with a moan. He stamps again, steps free and kicks her hard in the head.

NEWSPAPER BUILDING - GROUND FL. CAFE - EARLY EVENING 184 Rachel sits, still smoking, though it's dark outside now. There is a sound of chatter from above her and she looks up to see JOURNALISTS spilling out from the offices above, coming down the stairs towards her.

She checks the face, slips the sheet back in the bag, looks up, studying the men descending towards her. Moments later she has found him - chatting to a colleague. He reaches the ground floor and walking past her, goes to the bar for a coffee. Rachel finds herself staring at him -   the man WHO COULD DESTROY HER LIFE. Yuri seems to sense someone watching him and looks to where Rachel was sitting. But there's no-one there. 185    INT. NEWSPAPER OFFICE LOBBY. CONTINUOUS.",

A quick twist and the beam becomes ULTRAVIOLET.

We see four PURPLE FINGERPRINTS, one deeply pigmented, the other three progressively less so. Rachel takes a deep breath and punches the four marked keys in what she hopes is the correct order.

His hand searches blindly for the dropped scissors. Rachel grapples with him, almost embracing him, apparently trying to prevent him for reaching it. His searching hand locates the scissors and his eyes open in triumph, staring straight into Rachel's. He raises the scissors above his head. Then he stabs Rachel in the stomach. Rachel jack-knifes, as if she's been punched. Then...nothing. Both lie still. The only sound is Vogel's rasping breathing. Slowly Vogel gathers himself, drops the scissors, gets onto his knees - the victor. He climbs to his feet and begins to limp towards the door. 242     INT.

Suddenly he staggers against the wall. Something's wrong, something in his back. He twists around trying to locate the source of the strange sensation. And there it is - the HYPODERMIC NEEDLE Rachel has stuck between his shoulders. He touches it with his fingertips, eyes wide with horror, feeling the rush of lethal chemicals through his blood. He twists again trying to pull the needle free but his legs are already giving way and he collapses to the floor. Moments later he's dead.",
