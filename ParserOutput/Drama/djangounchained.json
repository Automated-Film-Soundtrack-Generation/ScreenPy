Django is free. Dr.SCHULTZ There you go Django,. Give your ankles a good rubbing, then get up on that horse. Also, if I was you, I'd take that winter coat the dear departed Speck left behind. Django removes the coat from the dead slaver. Puts on the warm jacket over his bare back, and climbs up on Ace Specks horse. Dr.Schultz turns to Dicky on the ground.

Or ... .Two, you unshackle yourselves, take that rifle over there. . .put a bullet in his head, bury the two of them deep, and make your way to a more enlightened area of the country. The choice is yours. He's just about ready to ride off, when the good doctor adds;",

But Calvin Candie can't hide his sinister side from Broomhilda, and it keeps her uncomfortable, until she excuses herself from the table to go to bed. Scotty's having such a good time with his fancy friends he opts to stay behind.'Broomhilda leaves in a bit of a huff, due to Scotty's disobedience. If these fancy.fucking white men weren't around making Scotty feel so puffy chested, he'd never dismiss her that way. We FOLLOW Broomhilda out of the club, across the street, to the hotel.",

They are being served by the black people we've come to know at Candyland (Stephen, Cora, and because Dr.Schultz likes her Broomhilda). Along with an army of DOMESTIC SLAVES acting as wait service. Knowing Django's a slaver, and for his dinner table privileges, the Domestic Slaves despise Django. Even Broomhilda will be shocked to hear him speak like a slaver, even though they obviously gave her a heads up on their masquerade. We pick up the conversation in mid-negotiation.",

And if I wanted to sell Eskimo Joe for that, I could sell 'em any day of the week. But like you said in Greenville doctor, I don't wanna sell 'em. It was only your ridiculous offer of twelve thousand dollars that would make me consider it.

Then SUDDENLY Schultz SLAPS the table hard with his hand, and says; Dr.SCHULTZ Why not! Monsieur Candie, you have a deal, Eskimo Joe, twelve thousand dollars! The White people at the table get very happy. Dr.Schultz continues; Dr.SCHULTZ However, that is a tremendous amount of money. And the way you have your Mr.Moguy, I have a lawyer, a persnickety man named Tuttle. And I would need my man to draw up a legal contract before I would feel comfortable exchanging that amount of money for flesh. Not to mention having Eskimo Joe examined by a physician of my choosing.

Before the other three have really registered what's happening, Django has crossed the distance, and is YANKING The Axe out of JAKE'S FACE. And with AXE in hand, Django chases and fights with all three trackers, till after a point where he's CHOPPED DOWN TWO OF THEM, Lex, and Stew, and now there's only Mr.Stonesipher left. But Mr.Stonesipher has managed to draw his gigantic BUCK KNIFE, and is able to fight back against Django. You know Stonesipher's great with a knife, plus his fighting style is like one of his dogs, attack attack attack. Django uses the axe handle in a defensive position. The expert Mountain Boy begins SCORING BLADE CUTS on shirtless Django. The two men fight until they end up losing their weapons. Then it's just a fight of brute strength, and survival. Mr.Stonesipher is physically bigger then Django. But if Django's going to save Broomhilda, not to mention get revenge on all these Candyland motherfuckers, he has to take Stonesipher's ass out. This Black Man who has been under the yoke of white man's domination all his life, and this White Man who feeds black people to dogs, fight each other for their life. Django gets his arm around Stonesipher's neck in a headlock, but the mountain boy is big enough to lift Django. So like a rodeo rider holding onto bull for dear life, Django tightens his lock around his opponents neck. Django gets his hand on the HAMMER Jake was building the birdhouse with, and BRINGS IT CRASHING DOWN ON THE TOP OF STONESIPHER'S HEAD. That weakens Stonesipher. He HITS HIM AGAIN IN THE HEAD. That drops Stonesipher to his knees. He HITS HIM AGAIN WITH THE HAMMER ON THE HEAD. That puts the mountain man down on his back. He HITS HIM ONE MORE TIME WITH THE HAMMER TO keep him down for good. The Trackers are all dead. Only the dogs mad barking remains.",
