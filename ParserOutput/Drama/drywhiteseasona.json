BARAGWANATH MORTUARY - DAY A white-uniformed assistant leads a line of African parents, reeking of sadness, into a cool room where metal drawers open from the walls. Stanley and JULIUS their black lawyer -- the two men seem to be very well-known, people shake hands with them, salute them -- Gordon and Emily's sadness is tinged with anger -- they have dignity, defiance, bowed with grief as they are. Stanley's large hand is placed gently on Emily's shoulder as they examine the dead faces before them. They belong to children, some    in torn, dirty clothes, others naked, some mutilated,    others whole and seemingly unharmed, as if asleep, until    the small, neat hole in temple or chest and the small    crust of blood is brought to our attention. A woman behind them starts to scream. They look around to see her holding onto a drawer, her legs buckling. Another woman pulls her close to grieve with her. The assistant approaches them and after a soft exchange he writes a name on a tag and ties it onto the body. The woman can't, won't leave her dead child. Her friend has to pull her away.

Inside the casket, brass fittings, white satin, lies Gordon, incongruous, ludicrous in a black Sunday suit.

JOHANNESBURG - STREET - AFTERNOON Stanley and Ben are driving in the outskirts of Johannesburg. EXT. APPROACHES OF SOWETO - AFTERNOON Stanley drives seemingly alone at very high speeds, which he maintains through the streets of Soweto... using his horn to scatter people out of his way, to the anger and indulgence of others. The CAR SCREECHES to a halt outside Emily's house. Stanley gets out of the car and greets the startled neighbors... and acknowledges the friendly shouts of children. Stanley looks around, then goes back to the car, opens the back door, leans and says something. Suddenly, to everyone's astonishment, Ben crawls out of the car; Stanley hustles him into Emily's house. Stanley waves at the people, a sign of assurance, then closes the door behind him. INT. EMILY'S HOUSE - AFTERNOON Ben stands awkwardly for a moment, taking in the room and the people in it. He then walks over to Emily who is standing at the table. He goes to shake her hand.",
