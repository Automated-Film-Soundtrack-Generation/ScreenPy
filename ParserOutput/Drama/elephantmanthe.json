Off to his left he sees a man wrapped in a black cape, holding a conch shell aloft and blowing powerfully into it. The tent is dimly lit with flickering oil lamps. People mill about through the weaving corridors. To Treves' right, he sees a sign reading, \"The Deadly Fruit of the Original Sin,\" over a small, very dark corridor. Treves enters the passage and disappears into the shadows. The corridor has a series of flaps and turns to disorient the spectator. Treves carefully pushes his way through and arrives at the inner chamber. In a roped-off space stands a small stage set at eve-level, with curtains on three sides. On the stage is a bell jar filled with grey-murky fluid lit from behind with casts an eerie glow in the chamber. Suspended in the fluid is the life-sized body of a baby-doll with the attached head of a large snake. At the join of head and body is a blob of unidentifiable organic matter. It is obviously phony, but the effect is still very disquieting. At the bottom of the jar, in the muck, sits an apple with two large bites out of it. Behind the jar is a painting on the order of a religious triptych, portraying Adam on one side, Eve on the other, and the tree flowering over the jar. Treves' impassive face is bathed in the watery glow. He studies the strange object with a critical eye. In the passage we hear movement, and an OLDER GENTLEMAN enters. He seems visibly impressed with \"The Deadly Fruit of the Original Sin.\"",

The Elephant Man is naked to the waist, his feet are bare and he wears a pair of worn trousers from a fat man's dress suit. He is a little below average height, and looks shorter from the bowing of his back. His head is enormous and misshapen, as big around as a man's waist. From his brow projects a huge boney mass, almost obscuring his right eye. His nose is a nose of flesh, recognizable only from its position. From the upper jaw projects another mass of bone protruding from the mouth like a stump, turning the upper lip inside out, making a slobbering aperture. It almost gives the impression of a rudimentary trunk or tusk. On top of his head is a handful of lank, black hair. At the back of it hangs a bag of spongy skin, resembling cauliflower. These loathsome growths cover his back and hang down to the middle of his thighs. The right arm is enormous and shapeless, the hand like a knot of tuberous roots. His left arm is not only normal, but delicately shaped, with fine skin and a hand that any woman might envy. From his chest hangs another bag of flesh, like the dewlap of a lizard. His legs are also grossly deformed, his feet great stumps. Behind him, as painted in the portrait, are two crudely constructed palm trees. The Owner harshly raps again.",

In the center of the room is a long oak table with a fine linen table cloth, around which sits a number of Doctors, among them, Fox. Some of them are still eating. A waiter is clearing away a few plates and several Doctors are helping themselves to port wine kept in decanters in the center of the table and to cigars in humidors. One of them is reading The Times. At one end of the table sits Treves, picking at his food. #1 DOCTOR \"...in life until he came under the kind care of the nursing staff of the London Hospital and the surgeon who has befriended him...\" #2 DOCTOR Good publicity for the Hospital, at any rate. #3 DOCTOR Treves comes off well too, eh Freddie? #4 DOCTOR It was pleasant of you to join us this evening, Frederick. #2 DOCTOR Your Elephant Man dining out this evening? #4 DOCTOR I understand the kitchen ran out of hay this morning.

Bytes and the boy are keeping a watchful eye on the Night Porter, who is making a deal with a couple of men at a table. They hand over a few coins and follow the Night Porter out of the pub. Bytes finishes his beer and thumps the glass down on the bar. He wipes his mouth with his sleeve and he and the boy casually follow the other three men out. Bytes and the boy stand by the pub door, watching the men cross the street and go to the back gate of the hospital which the Night Porter unlocks, and leaves unlocked, but closed, behind them. They walk into Bedstead Square, laughing quietly. Bytes crosses the street and goes to the gate. He walks along the iron fence and watches the Night Porter and his \"customers\". He stops and waits to see where they go. The Night Porter stands the two men before a window and motions for them to wait. He goes through a door into the hospital. After a few moments the window opens wide, and there, neatly framed and silhouetted, stand Merrick and the Night Porter, gripping Merrick's neck. The two men outside start back in shock, but stand mesmerized by what they see. We hear the laughter of the Night Porter echo across the empty square. Bytes smiles broadly and says softly to himself.",

Quick enquiries proved it to be none other than Mr. John Merrick, The Elephant Man, with whom our readers are undoubtedly familiar. After a chat of three-quarters of an hour, Mrs. Kendal was kind enough to leave Mr. Merrick with an autographed portrait of herself. Owing to a disfigurement of the most extreme nature, Mr. Merrick has never been properly presented to London society.
