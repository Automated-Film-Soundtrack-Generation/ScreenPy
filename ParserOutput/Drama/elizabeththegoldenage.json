This is the route from the Presence Chamber to the Chapel Royal. May 1 Blue Draft - p.15 Every Sunday the Queen processes here, and crowds gather to see her. Two of Walsingham's men, AGENTS 1 and 2, mingle in the crowd: faces we'll see again. Tom Babington stands unobtrusively at the back of the crowd. He carries a bag which may or may not contain a gun. A bustle of activity, a ripple of anticipation - `She's coming!' - and the palace doors open. BABINGTON'S POV: the crowd, the wall of BODYGUARDS, the cluster of COURTIERS and LADIES, and in their midst, Elizabeth, almost completely masked as she passes by. Alongside the Queen, among her maids-of-honour, is Bess Throckmorton; behind her, Walsingham. The people cheer, call out to the Queen, reach to touch her, fall to their knees.",
