The late sun turns the sand every color from crimson to black. An old AEROPLANE is flying over the Sahara.  Its shadow swims over the contours of sand. A woman's voice begins to sing unaccompanied on the track.  Szerelem, szerelem, she cries, in a haunting lament for her loved one. INSIDE the aeroplane are two figures.  One,  A WOMAN, seems to be asleep.  Her pale head rests against the side of the cockpit.  THE PILOT, a man, wears goggles and a leather helmet.  He is singing, too, but we can't hear him or the plane or anything save the singer's plaintive voice. The plane shudders over a ridge.  Beneath it A SUDDEN CLUSTER OF MEN AND MACHINES, camouflage nets draped over the sprawl of gasoline tanks and armored vehicles.  An OFFICER, GERMAN, focuses his field glasses. The glasses pick out the MARKINGS on the plane.  They are English.  An ANTI-AIRCRAFT GUN swivels furiously. Shocking bursts of GUNFIRE.  Explosions rock the plane, which lurches violently.  THE WOMAN SLUMPS FORWARD, slamming her head against the instruments.  The pilot grabs her, pulls her back, but she's not conscious.  The fuel tank above their heads is punctured.  It sprays them both, then EXPLODES. THE MAN FALLS OUT OF THE SKY, clinging to his dead lover.  The are both ON FIRE.  She is wrapped in a parachute silk and it burns fiercely.  He looks up to see the flames licking at his own parachute as it carries them slowly to earth.  Even his helmet is on fire, but the man makes no sound as the flames erase all that matters - his name, his past, his face, his lover... 2",

It floats in darkness, shimmering from the light of a fire.  The image develops to reveal a man carrying a giant wooden yoke from which hang DOZENS OF SMALL GLASS BOTTLES, on different lengths of string and wire.  He could be an angel. The man approaches the litter which carries the Pilot.  He's still in the protective reed mask, wrapped in blankets.  The MERCHANT DOCTOR stands over the burned body and sinks sticks either side of him deep into the sand, then moves away, free of the yoke, which balances in the support of the two crutches.  He puts some liquid in the Pilot's tongue, whose eyes almost instantly begin to roll.  Then he slowly sets about peeling away the layers of oiled cloth which protect the Pilot's flesh. The Merchant Doctor crouches in front of the curtain of bottles and MAKES A SKIN CUP with the soles of his feet, then leans back to pluck, hardly looking, certain bottles, which he uncorks and mixes in the bowl he'd made with his feet.  This mixture he uses to anoint the burned skin.  Next he finds green-black PASTE - ground Peacock Bone - and BEGINS TO RUB IT on to the Pilot's rib cage.  All the while he us humming and chanting.  The bottles continue to jingle. 6*.",

A second European, ALMASY, stands beside him, holding tools and a section of the camshaft.  Madox yanks out a perished rubber hose and holds it up for Almasy to inspect.  Behind them is an ENCAMPMENT - some camels foraging in the meager scrub, half a dozen black tents of the BEDOUIN: guides and servants to the Almasy/Madox Expedition.  It's 1938 and the whole continent is full of such expeditions, competing with each other, pursuing lost treasures, sources of rivers, hidden cities. D'AGOSTINO, the team's Italian ARCHEOLOGIST, drives towards the plane in one of the expedition's adapted FORD MOTORCARS.  He gets out carrying a large earthenware WATER JAR.

Now Kip, on the ground, still holding the rope, walks forward and causes Hana to SWING to the right.  She lets out a giddy laugh, exhilarated and nervous, and she flies, illuminating - en passant - faces, bodies, angels.  Kip guides the rope as if they were making love, which in a way they are. Hana arrives, hovering, in front of THE QUEEN OF SHEBA TALKING TO SOLOMON. She's overwhelmed.  She reaches out to touch the giant neck of the sad Queen.

TOBRUK RUINED QUARTER.    DAY. A HILL OF SALVAGED ARMY BOOTS is being explored by a couple of GERMAN SOLDIERS in search of better footwear.  Below them the POWS trudge by, one of them barefoot.  ONE OF THE GERMANS tosses down a pair of boots then continues his own perusal. 146b*. EXT.    TOBRUK SQUARE.    DAY. A crowd of Tobruk CIVILIANS - French and Italians among the MOSTLY ARAB FACES.  Their papers are being thoroughly checked by officers sitting at open desks. IN A LINE, WEARING HIS SHABBY SUIT, IS CARAVAGGIO.  AN ARAB WOMAN in front of him is arguing over the identity of her ominously CAUCASIAN-LOOKING CHILD.  An INTERPRETER mediates.  The OFFICER doesn't believe the woman.  She's getting frantic at the possibility of losing her child. Suddenly there's a disturbance as a WOMAN is dragged along the line by her hair.  She's bloodied, and has been tortured, and it's hard to recognize her as the pretty AICHA.  She touches a couple of people in the line.  They're horrified.  Soldiers pull them away.  Caravaggio doesn't look, stares straight ahead.  An officer watches him AS HE TURNS BRIEFLY AND HELPLESSLY OUT OF CONCERN FOR HER.  THEIR EYES CATCH FOR AN INSTANT AND THE OFFICER SEES IT. CARAVAGGIO RUNS, bolts for cover, vaulting the rubble which blocks one corner of the square.  The CONGREGATION throws itself to the ground until the square has only standing soldiers and a running man. 146c*. EXT.   TOBRUK.   INTERIOR OF RUINED BUILDING.   DAY. Shots pursue Caravaggio as he disappears behind the rubble, then bobs up again as he darts inside a blasted building.  He clambers up some ruined stairs, heaves over the wall. 146d*. EXT.   TOBRUK.   FACADE OF RUINED BUILDING.   DAY. CARAVAGGIO grabs a metal bar on the facade of the building, from which he hangs, looking for the next foothold.  Soldiers appear along the top of the building, shouting, rifles ready.  AN OFFICER arrives and stops the soldiers firing, and the others begin to laugh as Caravaggio hangs from the bar fifteen feet above a balcony, slowly losing his strength. Another SOLDIER waits for him in the balcony below.  Now he starts to laugh.  Caravaggio hangs. 147*.",

There are accordions, there's dancing, and there's HARDY, stripped to some exotic underpants, a large tattoo: DORIS inside a heart, clambering up the EQUESTRIAN STATUE IN THE MIDDLE OF THE FOUNTAIN.  He's astride the horse and now straining to get up to the tip of the outstretched sword, so that he can hang the UNION JACK FLAG he has in his mouth. BLACKLER, one of the Sappers, is Hardy's assistant.  He's drunk and slips from his ladder, falling flat on his back into the fountain with a great splash, to much hilarity. 166        INT.    THE PATIENT'S ROOM.    NIGHT. Hana and Caravaggio are still dancing.  The music has stopped. Caravaggio changes the record.  Hana goes to Kip for a second, beaming, before Caravaggio has snatched her away again.  The Patient taps along to the music.",
