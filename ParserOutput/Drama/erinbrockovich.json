DISCO MUSIC blares from its speakers. EXT. HINKLEY, CA - DAY This is a dry, desolate part of California.  No downtown, no community.  Just tract after tract of arid farmland, with small, bland, unprotected ranch home cropping up out of the landscape like occasional tombstones. A beat-up old sign on the road reads: \"HINKLEY, CA.  POP: \" but the  corner where the number would be has broken off. As a gust of wind lifts dust from the fields, Erin turns onto Community Boulevard, the main road that cuts through Hinkley. INT. ERIN'S HYUNDAI - DAY Erin looks around.  The house she's passing has been razed. A heap of lumber and wires in the middle of the property. As she checks the piece of paper with Donna's address, she drives by the PG&E COMPRESSOR STATION, a massive gray structure of pipes, chimneys and ladders, set way back from the road.  Erin passes it without noticing it. She stops at an intersection.  The house on the corner has been boarded up with plywood.  Erin notices it -- depressing -- then turns the corner onto Donna's street. EXT. DONNA IRVING'S HOUSE - DAY A generic ranch home standing all alone in the middle of nothing.  There's a pool out back and a chain link fence hugging the property.  No landscaping.  Dull, but clean.  A few BOTTLES OF SPRING WATER wait by the door. The Hyundai pulls into the driveway and stops.  Erin gets out.  As she heads up to the door, her spike heels sink into the dirt.  She rings the bell.  It has a melody chime. DONNA IRVING opens the door.  She's 35, petite, with a scrappy, high-strung manner.  She's wearing tight jeans, and her dark curls are piled on top of her head.",
