She stops to catch her breath, then continues and passes several archway with letters printed above them.  When she arrives at one topped by an LL, she slips a card in a slot.  A plastic molded chair drops into the archway.  She sits in the chair; it rises. INT. TUBE -DAY The woman is still in the chair as it slips gracefully into a line of chairs shooting through a glass tube.  The other chairs are peopled with commuters.  We stay with the woman as she and the others travel over New York City in the tube. There are hundreds of these commuter tubes crisscrossing the skyline.  The woman glances at the manuscript in her lap. It's called: Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind This serves as the movie's opening title.  The other credits follow, as the old woman studies commuters in passing tubes. Their faces are variously harsh and sad and lonely and blank. INT. WAITING ROOM - DAY SUBTITLED: FIFTY YEARS EARLIER Every doctor's office waiting room: chairs against the wall, magazines on end tables, a sad-looking potted plant, generic seascape paintings on the walls.  The receptionist, Mary, 25, can be seen typing in the reception area.  Behind her are shelves and shelves of medical files.  The door opens and Clementine enters.  She's in her early thirties, zaftig in a faux fur winter coat over an orange hooded sweatshirt.  She's decidedly funky and has blue hair.  Mary looks up.",

BEACH - DAY Joel stares out at the ocean.  Far down the beach Clementine stares at it, too.  Joel glances sideways at her then back at the ocean. EXT. MONTAUK TRAIN STATION PLATFORM - LATE AFTERNOON Joel sits on the bench waiting for a train.  Clementine enters the platform, sees Joel, the only other person there. She waves, sort of goofily enthusiastic, playing as if they're old friends.  He waves back, embarrassed.  She takes a seat on a bench far down the platform.  Joel stares at his hands, pulls out his journal and tries to write in order to conceal his awkwardness. INT. TRAIN - A BIT LATER Joel sits at the far end of the empty car and watches the slowly passing desolate terrain.  After a moment the door between cars opens and Clementine enters.  Joel looks up. Clementine is not looking at him; she busies herself deciding where to sit.  She settles on a seat at the opposite end of the car.  Joel looks out the window.  He feels her watching him.  The train is picking up speed.  Finally:",
