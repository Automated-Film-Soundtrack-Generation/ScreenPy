There is no way to give each year its allotted weight, to include each event, each person who helped to shape a lifetime. What can be done is to be faithful in spirit to the record, and to try to find one's way to the heart of the man...\" And now we are approaching the city, the squalor of the little shanty dwellings around the outskirts, the shadows of large factories... And as we move nearer, coursing over the parched terrain, the tiny fields of cultivation, strands of sound are woven through the main titles, borne on the wind, images from the life we are seeking: British: \"Who the hell is he?!\", lower class British: \"I don't know, sir.\"... \"My name is Gandhi. Mohandas K. Gandhi.\"... A woman's voice, tender, soft: \"You are my best friend, my highest guru... and my sovereign lord.\"... A man (Gandhi): \"I am asking you to fight!\"... An angry aristocratic English voice: \"At home children are writing 'essays' about him!\"... the sound of massed rifle fire, screams...",

Godse moves forward through them toward the front just as hushed voices begin to remark -- \"I see him.\" \"Here he comes!\" \"Which one is Manu?\"... Apte and Karkare move to different sides of Godse, staying a little behind, their movements sly and wary, aware of people watching. Featuring Gandhi. We see him distantly through the crowd. The brown, wiry figure cloaked only in loincloth and shawl, still weak from his last fast and moving without his customary spring and energy as he is supported by his two grand nieces, his \"walking sticks,\" Manu and Abha. We do not see him clearly until the very last moment -- only glimpses of him as he smiles, and exchanges little jokes with some of the crowd and the two young women who support him, occasionally joining his hands together in greeting to someone in particular, then once more proceeding with a hand on the shoulder of each of the girls. The camera keeps moving closer, and the point of view is always Godse's, but Gandhi is always in profile or half obscured by the heads and shoulders of those in front. We hear the occasional click of a camera, and we intercut with shots of Godse moving tensely up through the crowd, of Apte and Karkare on the periphery of the crowd, watching with sudden fear and apprehension, like men paralysed by the presence of danger. Featuring Godse. He slides through to the very front rank. His breathing is short and there is perspiration around the sides of his temples. And now, for an instant we see Gandhi close from his point of view. He is only a few steps away, but turned to speak to someone on the other side, and Manu half obscures him. Godse swallows dryly, tension lining his face -- then he moves boldly out into Gandhi's path, bumping Manu, knocking a vessel for incense from her hands.",

Godse moves his right hand rapidly from the stance of prayer to his jacket, in an instant -- it holds a gun, and he fires point blank at Gandhi -- loud, startling -- once, twice... thrice.

We only hear a strange, rhythmic shuffling, pierced by an occasional wail of grief. We see the soldiers and sailors lining the route, their hands locked together in one seemingly endless chain. We see the two hundred men of the Army, Navy and Air Force drawing the Army weapon-carrier that bears the body of Gandhi. And finally we see Gandhi lying on the weapon-carrier, surrounded by flowers, a tiny figure in this ocean of grief and reverence.",

A policeman and the conductor are pulling Gandhi from the First Class car. Gandhi is clinging to the safety rails by the door, a briefcase clutched firmly in one hand. The European cracks on Gandhi's hands with his fist, breaking Gandhi's grip and the policeman and conductor push him across the platform. It is ugly and demeaning. Disgustedly, the conductor shakes himself and signals for the train to start. Gandhi rights himself on the platform, picking up his briefcase, his face a mixture of rage, humiliation, impotence. The conductor hurls Gandhi's book at his feet as the train starts to move. Gandhi picks up the book, looking off at the departing train. A lamp swinging in the wind alternately throws his face into light and darkness. His point of view. The Black porter stares out of a window at him, then we see the European taking his seat again, righteously. The conductor standing in the door, watching Gandhi even as the train pulls out. Then the Second Class coach, with people standing at the window to stare at Gandhi -- then the Third Class coaches, again with Blacks and a few Indians looking at Gandhi with mystification and a touch of fear. Gandhi stands with a studied air of defiance as the train pulls away -- but when it is gone he is suddenly very aware of his isolation and looks around the cold, dark platform with self-conscious embarrassment. A Black railway worker looks as if he would like to express sympathy, but he cannot find the courage and turns away from Gandhi's gaze, pulling his collar up against the piercing wind. The policeman who pulled Gandhi from the train talks with the ticket-taker under the gas-lit entrance gate, both of them staring off at Gandhi. An Indian woman near the entrance sits in a woolen sari, her face half-veiled. A small child sleeps in her arms, and there is a tattered bundle of clothing at her feet. She turns away from Gandhi's gaze as though it brought the plague itself.",

One old man, sleepless like Gandhi, stares back at him across the shadowed squalor of the coach; somewhere unseen a crying baby is soothed by his mother. Gandhi looks at the bench across from him.

People have come out of the coaches to cool their heads with the touch of water, to stretch their legs. We see an English clergyman from the Second Class coaches, dipping a toe cautiously into the water, children of some British enlisted soldiers wading, splashing, faces alight with fun. And, farther along, the parasols of one or two of the English First Class passengers, a woman dousing her neck delicately with perfume. A British officer, tunic unbuttoned, smoking a long cigar as he walks along in a few inches of water, his trousers rolled up, his shoes off. Across the river down from the Third Class coaches a small group of Indian women is squatted by the river's edge, washing clothes. Some carry infants on their backs. Some small children stand near them. Their ritual of washing goes on, but they are all watching the passengers of the train. Gandhi stands with Ba and Charlie among the Third Class passengers. Ba cools her face with water. Charlie, his trousers rolled up, plays a tentative splashing game with a skinny little Indian boy. Gandhi is holding a large white head cloth which he is soaking in the water, but his eyes have been arrested by the sight of the women across the river. And now we see the women closely from his point of view, the camera panning slowly along them. Their bodies are skin and bone. The clothes they wear, which looked normal from the distance, are rags -- literally, shredded rages, one hung on another. The children are hollow-eyed and gaunt, staring listlessly at the train. One boy, with a stump for an arm, aimlessly pushes at the flies that buzz around him. Gandhi stands erect, lost now in the revelation of their poverty. His eyes hold on one woman at the river bank. Though her frail face is almost skeletal, it is beautiful but scarred by a severe rash down her cheek and neck. The cloth she is washing is a shredded piece of muslin. Her eyes have met Gandhi's as he watches her. Gandhi stares for a moment, a long beat. Then he slowly moves his arm out into the water and, without taking his eyes from her, releases the head cloth he has been rinsing. It floats along on the water down toward the woman. She looks from Gandhi to it with sudden excitement, a sense of incredulity. As the cloth nears her, she rises and moves almost greedily out into the water to take it. Her hands snatch at it quickly. Then she stands, looking at Gandhi. The infant on her back shifts, its huge hollow eyes reacting to the movement. Gandhi smiles slowly, tilting his head just slightly to her. And now that she has possession of the cloth, her manner calms again. And she looks back at him, and her lips almost part with a tiny smile of thanks. Hold Gandhi, staring at her, fighting the pain in his eyes...",

Princes, maharajahs, generals, ranking British civil servants and their ladies taking tea on the manicured lawns among the exotic flowers. But over all there is a thread of anxiety, we pick up one or two nervous phrases: \"At the West Gate there were no taxis at all!,\" \"Of course, the Army will always be loyal.\" And the camera picks out a civil servant stepping from a door of the palace carrying a sheaf of telegrams and cable forms. He searches the assembled guests, then heads with almost indecorous haste toward his target. It is the Viceroy, Lord Chelmsford. With him, talking quietly, are his aide-de-camp, the Governor of the province and his ADC, and the commanding general of the Army in India. Lord Chelmsford's ADC is the first to react to the civil servant's arrival and his impatient attendance.",

Dyer faces a panel of Commissioners: Lord Hunter, presiding, Mr. Justice Rankin, General Barrow, a British civil servant, and an Indian barrister. The Commission functions like a public parliamentary committee -- little ceremony, no judicial robes, a small group of public and press, who sit on wooden chairs behind a barrier that isolates the Commission's business.

And finally the camera comes to a close shot of Gandhi, matching that of Dyer, whom we have just left. He is surveying the wall in the now empty park numbly, desolately. Nehru stands a few feet away from him, his mood the same, the same benumbed grief and incredulity. Resume the wall -- Gandhi's point of view. The camera continues its pan -- bits of human hair matted in the dried blood, and the bullet-ripped foliage, the well, trampled ground around it, little pieces of clothing. Flies buzz around the debris. Abstractedly, Gandhi touches the bucket rope that lies across the surround. Nehru has moved to the other side of the well. Gandhi lifts his eyes to him...",

As their defiant roar carries through the night air we see that Gandhi sits cross-legged on the platform. Nehru is with him. Patel, now for the first time in an Indian tunic, and Azad, also in an Indian tunic. Desai, Gandhi's new male secretary, is with them.

In close shot we see other British soldiers watching on the perimeter of the crowd and they are now made even more wary by the enthusiasm of this greeting.

A policeman on duty holds the door and the fleeing police, first one, then two more, then the last three, run into the building. The crowd surges around it, smashing windows, hurling stones. Close shot. English cloth shirts pushed together and ignited. Second close shot. Trousers, already aflame, being hurled through a broken window. All around, the noise of the angry, surging crowd, stones raining on the building. Shouts: \"Out -- Out!\" Later. A corner of the building engulfed in flames. The camera pulls back and we see the whole building swept with fire. The heat of it keeps the crowd back but they are still shouting \"Out -- Out! -- Out\" -- and a sudden cheer. At the door of the flaming building. One policeman appears, his face blackened with soot, his hands up over his head. Another appears in the smoke behind him, and they start to come out -- not only the original six but the five or six others who were in the building -- rushing suddenly from the heat of the fire. Close shot -- the crowd. We are close on the body of the first policeman as he runs into the crowd and on the instant we see a sword slash at his arm. Another angle. The crowd massed around the fallen figure, a flash of the sword going up over the heads -- a breathless pause -- and it comes down again... savagely. Later. The flames of the crumbled building. The crowd has gone and we only hear the roar of the flames. The camera pans across the flames, and we see a skull, charred flesh still clinging to it, the eyes black holes, the teeth bare as it burns in the fire.",

The clerk turns and says in a moderately loud voice -- CLERK Call the prisoner to the bar. The sergeant-at-arms turns and moves to the door at the side of the bench. The courtroom immediately falls silent. The sergeant-at-arms opens the door -- a moment -- and Gandhi enters slowly. He has recovered a bit more, but he still moves slowly. Featuring Judge Broomfield. As Gandhi enters, he lowers his glasses, places them on his desk, and rises, facing Gandhi. Featuring two English court reporters. One nudges the other in astonishment, signaling off toward the judge. Their point of view. The clerk, confused as well as astonished, see the judge standing, facing Gandhi in respect, and dutifully, he too stands. Resume the reporters. A disbelieving exchange of glances, the sound of others standing around them. They glance back. Full shot -- the courtroom. The whole court rises, the astounded reporters the last of all. Featuring Gandhi. He takes the prisoner's stand. He looks around, a little surprised, a little affected by the demonstration. He looks up at the judge. For a minute their eyes meet, the judge makes a little bow to Gandhi. Gandhi reciprocates... and the judge sits down.

A little band of drummers and flute players suddenly begins to play. The crowd starts to jump up to see, and the flower petals begin to float in the sky. \"Gandhi! Long live Mahatma Gandhi!\" Another angle. Gandhi and the procession of marchers and ashramites stride down the dusty road toward them. A newsreel truck and crew ride along about two-thirds of the way back. A car of cameramen and reporters tails at the end. Featuring Gandhi.

The camera pans from them, across a sloping dip in the ground, to a huge group of volunteers lining up to face the police as tautly as the police face them. Walker is off to one side, climbing to stand in the back of Collin's car. He watches, looking tensely from one group to the other, almost terrified by what seems about to happen. Collins leans against the back of the car near him, watching with an equally appalled expectancy. There are two other reporters near them. From Walker's point of view. We see Mirabehn and some Indian women quietly placing stretchers and tables of bandages near a group of tents where the volunteers have been housed. Walker turns back to the two opposing groups at the Salt Works entrance. We hear only a shuffle of feet, the clank of a lathi against a metal police buckle.

And through it we intercut with Mirabehn and the Indian women rescuing the wounded, carrying them on stretchers to be bandaged. We see Walker helping once or twice, turning, watching, torn between being a professional spectator and a normal human being.

A fly moves along a small section of the floor that still contains a ribbon of the dying sunlight. Gandhi still sits, holding Ba's hand, staring into nothingness. The doctor appears in the doorway. He pauses, nods amiably to Gandhi, though Gandhi does not react to his presence at all. Moving quietly, the doctor goes to the other side of Ba and crouches, and lifts her wrist to feel her pulse. He holds it for a moment, then lifts his eyes in doubt and sudden fateful apprehension. He glances at her, then slowly lowers her arm and puts the branches of his stethoscope in his ears. He puts the acoustic bell over her heart... a moment, and he lifts it slowly, his face confirming for us what he and we already know: there is no heartbeat. He glances at Pyarelal, who only lowers his eyes. The doctor turns his head slowly to Gandhi. Gandhi. His point of view.

It stretches endlessly to the horizon.

And the camera lifts and tilts, slowly swinging to the opposite direction, and as it does, reveals another vast column across the track, several yards away, moving in the opposite direction: veiled women in purdah, the crescent flag of Muslim Pakistan here and there.

Nehru pauses as he lowers his head. His point of view. Gandhi lies curled awkwardly on his side of the cot. He is writing, Pyarelal taking the pages as he finishes, both ignoring all the people, the sounds of gunfire and distant shouting, but he looks tired and tightens his jaw occasionally in pain. The camera pans. A doctor sits near the foot of the cot, Abdul Ghaffar Khan beyond him. Near the other edge of the canopied area, Mirabehn sits with Bourke-White. They are whispering quietly, but Mirabehn has stopped on seeing Nehru and she smiles a relieved greeting. She knows Gandhi's feeling for him. Bourke-White stares at him and Patel for a second and then her hand goes slowly, almost reflexively, for her camera.",
