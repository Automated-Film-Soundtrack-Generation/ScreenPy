FESTA STREET - MED. VIEW - NIGHT By now the musicians have left, but still families are walking the street, and stopping at the booths. Fanucci stands there a moment; he is known by everyone, and considers himself highly loved. Then Fanucci begins the walk through the festa, on his way home. EXT. ROOFTOPS - MOVING VIEW - NIGHT Vito silently moves along the rooftop; paralleling Fanucci's walk. We HEAR the sounds of the festa, and every so often catch a glimpse of the patterned lights, and the crowds below. EXT. FESTA STREETS - MOVING VIEW ON FANUCCI - NIGHT walking through the crowded streets.  The statue of San Gennaro is arranged in some midnight religious ceremony. The VIEW LIFTS UP, to the rooftops. EXT. THE ROOFTOPS - NIGHT Vito makes the leap that separates two buildings; then crosses toward the large skylight in the center of the building. EXT. THE STREETS - NIGHT The procession in the streets is preceded by ten altar boys; and the glittering Monstrance, something of an altar carried out into the streets. The priest begins this nocturnal service, as the crowds in the street kneel down in prayer. INT. FANUCCI'S BUILDING - NIGHT Fanucci unlocks the door to his building; we can HEAR the services in the background. EXT. THE ROOFTOP - NIGHT Vito tries the trap door on the roof; it is stuck firmly shut; despite Clemenza's instructions.  He struggles with it, but no luck. From the distance, the Choir begins to Latin.  Vito moves around the skylight, to an identical trap, tries this one; it opens. EXT. THE MONSTRANCE - MED. VIEW ON THE PRIEST - NIGHT performing the services in Latin.  The ten altar boys are in attendance. EXT. THE ROOFTOP - NIGHT Vito reaches down into the trap, and pulls out the newly oiled gun that has been left for him.  He slides down into the building. INT.

INT. HALLWAY - NIGHT Vito climbs down from the attic, and finds Fanucci's rear door open.  He slips in, and makes his way past the open windows, out of which pour the music and chanting of the Mass.  Slowly and quietly he pulls them down, shut. He moves quietly to a glass door, and peeks out. WHAT HE SEES: Three young women, Fanucci's DAUGHTERS, laughing and talking. VIEW ON VITO A slip up.  Tessio had said they were out.  He steps outside to the alley where he can look into the apartment. ANOTHER VIEW Fanucci opens the door of his apartment, and enters. CLOSE VIEW ON VITO He begins to wrap the gun. VIEW ON THE DAUGHTERS Their father greets them with a kiss; and a little religious gift he has bought for each. CLOSE ON THE GUN wrapped in this primitive method of a silencer.  The VIEW TILTS to Vito, caught in the dilemma of having to kill all or none of them.  Then something catches his eye. WHAT HE SEES: A small gray alley cat is attracted to the young man, comes up to him and rubs itself against him.  Vito rubs the animal, speaking softly in Sicilian, then, gaining its confidence, lifts it up and carefully lets it into Fanucci's apartment. He steps back, holding the gun.  We HEAR some Italian shouted in the house; a loud sound from the cat, and some of the thumping footsteps of Fanucci. VIEW ON VITO holding the wrapped gun, waiting. WHAT HE SEES: The white blob of Fanucci opening the door and cursing in Italian as he throws the cat out. VIEW ON VITO squeezing the trigger; the muffled, but still LOUD BLAST resounding in the building. VIEW ON FANUCCI He holds onto the door frame, trying to stand erect, trying to reach for his gun.  The force of his struggle has torn the buttons off his jacket and made it swing loose.  His gun is exposed but so is a spidery vein on the white shirtfront of his stomach.  Carefully, as if plunging a needle into this vein, Vito Corleone fires a second bullet. Fanucci falls to his knees, propping the door open, giving a terrible groan.  We begin to hear the VOICES of girls inside the apartment. Vito quickly opens his wallet, removes the two hundred, quickly fires one last bullet into Fanucci's sweaty cheek. Now the towel the gun was wrapped with catches fire, literally on Vito's hand; quickly he throws it to the ground, stamps it out...and disappears upward. EXT. THE ROOFTOPS - MED. VIEW - NIGHT Vito moves like a cat along the rooftops; we HEAR the conclusion of the Mass down below. CLOSE ON VITO Pausing; we can SEE the great spectacle of lights and candles on the streets below. He empties the gun of bullets and smashes the barrel against the side of the roof ledge.  He reverses it in his hand, and breaks the butt into two separate halves against the chimney. He smashes it again, and the pistol breaks into barrel and handle, two separate pieces. He then moves along the rooftop, dropping the two separate fragments into various air shafts. EXT. THE STREET PROCESSION - MOVING VIEW - NIGHT The Priest, having completed the ceremony, follows as the Monstrance is carried off through the streets, as the Choir sings. EXT. THE ROOFTOPS - MOVING VIEW - NIGHT Vito is a dark figure, moving with agility across the rooftops. INT. FANUCCI'S VESTIBULE - MED. VIEW - NIGHT The corpse that was Fanucci, stained with blood. EXT. PROCESSION - CLOSE VIEW - NIGHT The statue of San Gennaro, followed by the altar boys. EXT. CORLEONE TENEMENT - MED. VIEW - NIGHT Vito's wife; her baby and several friends and neighbors sit happily on the front stoop of their tenement.  Some of the men drink wine poured out of a pitcher; we can still HEAR the music and night sounds of the Festa. A neighbor is singing a Neapolitan song. Quietly, without a word, and with only a momentary glance from his wife, Vito joins the little group; takes a glass of wine, and listens to the song. CLOSE VIEW ON VITO listening to the song.  He reaches out and takes the small hand of his son.",

DOWNTOWN NEW YORK - MOVING VIEW - DAY A black Cadillac moves down the street, slowed by the Festivities of the Festa that is in progress: people milling around, buying souvenirs at the many stands set up. Sausage and grilled meats are prepared, just as they were years ago.  Electric lights are strung from the street lamps, and brightly colored banners pronounce the \"Festa of the Madonna.\" MOVING CLOSE VIEW Willy Cicci drives, frustrated that he cannot go any faster. Next to him, Frankie Pentangeli sits, catching a few seconds' snooze. MED. VIEW The black car pulls up; another car that had been following it parks nearby. One of Pentangeli's button men gets out of the car, and steps into a small Italian restaurant; he exits quickly, and nods affirmatively toward Pentangeli's Cadillac. The group of them step out quickly, men huddled around Pentangeli, and enter the restaurant. INT. THE RESTAURANT - DAY The restaurant is quite empty, despite the excitement out on the street. Pentangeli immediately sits at a table with a tall, dark, snappily dressed young man, CARMINE ROSATO. Nearby, on the other side of the room is Rosato's brother, TONY, seated with a group of their men. At another table in the restaurant is a table of Pentangeli's people: they are joined by bodyguards.",

He is gone. INT. HOTEL CORRIDOR - MOVING VIEW ON BUSSETTA - NIGHT The first time ever away from Michael, moving toward us quickly.  He stops, knocks on the door of Roth's suite. Then quickly for a man his size, he moves without noise to the adjoining door, opens it with a key, and disappears inside. A moment elapses on the empty corridor, and then a roused Johnny Ola, opens the first door.  He steps out into the corridor, to see who had knocked.  Confused, he is about to return inside, when Bussetta easily breaks his neck in two from behind. INT. THE SUITE - MED. VIEW - NIGHT as Bussetta quietly pulls the limp body of Johnny Ola, his head bent at an impossible angle, and lays it at the foot of the couch. EXT. PRESIDENTIAL PALACE - NIGHT Guards who are regular troops patrol the Palace in twos, carrying machine weapons. Now an elite officer, checks the identification of the various cars carrying dignitaries, as they are driven up to the Palace.  The one being inspected at the moment contains Fredo and Michael.  We can see the beautifully dressed people on their way to the reception, and sense the cheerful mood of this New Year's Eve. INT. THE SUITE - NIGHT Bussetta bends over Ola's body, tying the wrists and knees with electrical extensions.  He then easily carries the body to the small balcony which all the rooms have. EXT. THE BALCONY - NIGHT Bussetta swings the body over the side of the balcony railing; tying the extension cord to the railing, and suspending the body so that it is invisible both from the inside and out during the night. INT. PRESIDENTIAL PALACE - VIEW ON THE MAIN FOYER - NIGHT The PRESIDENT, his WIFE and six oldest CHILDREN great formally the many beautifully and affluently dressed guests. He speaks to them in Spanish, as one by one they file to him.

VIEW - NIGHT The excitement of the night is beginning to build; people are out in the streets; poor people, but they are enthusiastic and lively. NEW VIEW Traffic stops, as an ambulance speeds its way to a hospital; SIREN going. INT. THE SUITE - NIGHT Bussetta delicately picks up a small satin cushion that had fallen from the couch, and replaces it as though nothing had happened.  Slowly he cracks the door open which adjoins Roth's bedroom.  There is a slight commotion; whispered voices. BUSSETTA'S VIEW Terri, Mrs. Roth, is crying.  A group of men lift Hyman Roth's frail body onto a stretcher. CLOSE ON BUSSETTA realizes that this is the man he is to kill. CLOSER VIEW ON ROTH He is alive; breathing hard with his mouth dry and open. The doctor examines him, and then gives instructions to the orderly who carries him out, presumably to the ambulance. Bussetta closes the door on this VIEW. INT. PRESIDENTIAL PALACE - NIGHT An orchestra plays for the guests, as an army of waiters serve champagne and hors d'oeuvres.

Gradually, these people leave him in the care of the hospital staff. Bussetta watches from the distance of the hallway; after the old man has been moved, he quietly walks down the hallway to the room.

The last time he had seen the estate it was warm, and the trees were full. MOVING VIEW approaching the great stone gates; closed.  The bodyguards are not readily visible, but they are there.  The iron gates are opened, and one of the men makes a simple nod of respect, as the car pulls in. NEW VIEW Inside the estate, the private roads have been freshly plowed, and occasionally a worker will pause to watch the car as it passes. The Grandchildren are in school now, and so the estate is especially quiet.  Although there are signs that children live here; a bicycle, a sled, a swing and gymnastic set, wet and with a rim of snow still on it. INT. MICHAEL'S HOUSE - VIEW FROM INSIDE THE HOUSE - DAY to the outside, where Michael walks slowly.  He stops and looks at a little Italian red sportscar made for children. NEW VIEW The front door opens, and Michael enters his own home.  It is very quiet, no one is at home to greet him.  He can see the evidence of his family; things his wife and his children have been using, and left on a sofa or a table. He moves toward his and Kay's bedroom, where we can HEAR the SOUND of a sewing machine running. Quietly he opens the door. MICHAEL'S VIEW into the bedroom.  Kay is sitting by the window, lit by the cold afternoon light, at work with her sewing machine.  She hasn't noticed that he's in the room yet, and goes on with her work. VIEW ON MICHAEL stands there a moment, watching, not making a sound.  And then without a word, he steps back, and closes the door, so that she doesn't see him. VIEW FROM INSIDE THE HOUSE onto Michael, moving outside, walking through the snow, he moves to the house next to his own. INT.

He embraces Vitone and pats the heads of his children, and leads them all into the garden. INT. THE VILLA - SUMPTUOUS MED. VIEW - LATE DAY A sumptuous table is set for the visiting family from America.  There is a warm atmosphere as Vito, his wife and children eat.  Tomasino and his family received presents from Carmella and to Tomasino's mother, and gifts are given to all of the children. All typically American representing some of the prosperity and interests in the consumer goods that followed a great war. EXT. CORLEONE PLAZA - DAY The family exits the church on the plaza of the town.  Vito shakes hands warmly with the priest. INT. VILLAGE COTTAGE - NIGHT The door is open -- the footsteps of a man enter the room. We follow these footsteps without quite knowing to whom they belong.  They lead us to a bed, where we see asleep an OLD MAN.  He sleeps in his undershirt and is sweating, covered by mosquito netting. VIEW ALTERS and we realize that it is young Vito looking at the MAN. We remember that the man is MOSCA, one of three men, who almost twenty years before had hunted down Vito when he was a boy.  With lightning speed, Vito slashes through the mosquito netting with a knife.  And with the movement precise as a butcher's he disembowls this man. EXT. OLIVE OIL WAREHOUSE - FULL VIEW Vito has brought his wife and children to see the Olive Oil Depot which is the link to his New York importing business. They go inside. INT. OLIVE OIL WAREHOUSE - DAY They are led by one of Vito's associates through rows and rows of large vats of olive oil.  Vito very proudly shows his associates in Italy the olive oil can that will be used in the United States.  They all stand around at the link to their new importing business and share a toast of wine. EXT. THE BAY - DAY A team of Sicilian fisherman are at work mending their nets. One sings accompanied by a guitar. VIEW MOVES TO ONE OF THE OLD FISHERMAN He is recognized as the second of the men who had hunted Vito down.  STROLLO.  As he walks we notice there is a figure that is moving through the drying sails and barrels, it is Vito.  He moves quietly, stepping up behind the old man.  In an instant, he has thrown a garrote around his throat, twisting it tight, so that there is very little sound. Then, almost silently dragging him through the space hidden by the drying sails. EXT. THE IMPRESSIVE ESTATE OF DON FRANCESCO - DAY We see an old car approach.  Its driver is the young Tomasino. Sitting in the car with him is Vito. The car stops at the gates, and an old guard sees and recognizes Tomasino, opens the gates allowing them to enter. MED. VIEW on an almost decrepit DON FRANCESCO.  He must be in his early nineties, sitting as powerful and as impressive as ever, in his throne-like chair from which he manages the power as the Mafia Chieftan of this village.  Young Don Tomasino is speaking. We notice in a little distance in the rear, there are some younger shepherds with shotguns thrown over their shoulders.",

I thank God for our democratic due process of Law that shields me from the false charges made by this committee's witness.
