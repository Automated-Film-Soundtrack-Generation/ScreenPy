The table overflows with food, floral decorations, and candles.  In the background, the children sit at a separate table; a maid serves them turkey.  The guests chatter comfortably among themselves as they eat.",

He looks down the street and the film cuts to his point of view: Frederick's loft building. The movie goes back to the impatient Elliot; he's looking around him.  He glances at his watch as the film cuts back once again to the loft building, where Lee finally appears, walking down the street away from Elliot.  A truck passes down the street.  Lee doesn't see him.  She walks further and further away; she turns a corner. Elliot frantically looks around again; then, in a burst of decision, he runs around a garbage dump, crossing the street, and still running, he moves down an adjacent street, past The Canal Lumber Company and several other buildings, as the film cuts back to Lee, walking down a different street, oblivious. The jazz plays on as the movie cuts back and forth between the fast-moving Elliot, rushing down the SoHo streets, past a truck waiting for a light to change, past some pedestrians, some garbage cans, turning corners, and the strolling Lee, walking up different streets, past different buildings. Lee eventually crosses a street, lost in thought, looking right and left, as Elliot, pretending nonchalance, waits on the corner, looking at his watch.  She looks up in surprise; the music stops.",

A light goes on, revealing a slouched- over Mickey sitting in a glass booth.  He is wearing a set of headphones.  The camera moves back, revealing a technician at the console on the other side of the booth.  Mickey signals with his finger when he hears a sound on his headset. The jazz continues. Next is an electronystagmography (ENG).  Graph paper rolls out of a machine, and after a brief glimpse of the rolling paper, the camera moves over to show Mickey lying terrified, without his glasses, on a couch, with electrodes stuck all over his head. The film then cuts to a BSER test room, where Mickey, sitting in a corner chair, wears another set of headphones. An electrode is attached to his forehead; a nearby technician sits at a computer video screen, looking at a monitoring graph. Last but not least is the tomography.  Over the shoulders of a technician in a booth, a large window displays a huge, white rotating machine.  It makes a whooshing noise as it turns.

Onstage, the soprano in the title role sings a mournful aria as she kneels by the ruins of a wagon.  The background is dark.  The film moves up to the private boxes in the upper loge.  David and Holly can be seen from a distance sitting in one of the boxes. David glances at her; he reaches down for a bottle of wine. The movie briefly cuts back to the stage.  The soprano is leaning on a wagon wheel; her voice soars.  Then it's back to a closer look at Holly and David in their box.  The aria continues as David hands a smiling Holly a glass.  He uncorks the wine and pours some in both their glasses. Holly mouths a thank you, glancing around.  They look at each other and raise their glasses in a toast.",

A slowly moving stretcher, bearing Mickey's strapped prone body, begins to enter the round opening of the module. As the camera pulls back from Mickey, his taped head under the scan, two technicians can be seen through the window separating the scanner from the control room.  One of them, sitting down, taps information into a computer while the other technician stands nearby, looking from Mickey to the computer screen. The movie then cuts briefly to the computer screen, showing an image of Mickey's skull.  Scan lines bleep over the skull. The camera moves up from the screen to reveal Mickey once again, as seen through the window, silent and serious under the CAT-scan module. From Mickey's prone form, the film moves to the two technicians, as seen through the window in the scanner room. They examine the computer screen and talk indistinctly to each other.  One of the men, nodding, taps more information into the computer. While they're studying the CAT-scan picture, the camera cuts to a back view of Mickey under the module.  There is a science-fiction feel to this scene, as if Mickey is lying in the center of a huge, white, futuristic circle.  The stretcher, bearing Mickey, slowly moves out of the module.",

A Christmas tree stands in the corner of the room, next to a table holding a lamp; a picture hangs on the wall.  The family has just finished eating; the table is cluttered with the remains of dinner, including a quart of milk, some chocolate syrup, and a bottle of ketchup.  Hannah's two adopted children stand by her chair; she is showing them how a small camera works.  The children watch her, fascinated, muttering among themselves.  Elliot looks listless.  He stares blankly at the table.",

Mickey starts pounding the door again as the movie cuts to: A beautiful snow-covered church downtown, complete with courtyard and wrought-iron fence.  A pedestrian walks by with an umbrella.  A church choir sings a soaring hymn over the scene. The music continues as the film moves inside, where the choir is seen singing behind an altar glowing warm gold.  A fairly large congregation sits in darkened pews as the film cuts to the back, where Mickey, his arms crossed, stands underneath some stained-glass windows, watching and listening to the inspiring music. The choir continues to sing as the movie cuts to Father Flynn in his office. He picks up some large, heavy books from a shelf near his window and he walks over to Mickey, who's standing near his desk, already holding several tomes.  Father Flynn puts the books on top of Mickey's pile; Mickey, flipping through the top one, awkwardly carries his bundle to the door. Next is seen a close-up of a painting of Jesus Christ on the cross, complete with crown of thorns and holy expression. His eyes, especially designed to blink as the lights hit them, open and close repeatedly.  The hymn plays on, loudly, as the camera moves back, revealing Mickey, standing outside a barber shop window, looking at the Christ playing and shuffling from side to side to gets its eyes' 3-D effect. Smaller inspirational pictures border the bigger, blinking Christ.  A barber pole with moving stripes stands nearby; passing traffic is reflected in the window. Mickey turns from the window, shrugging, and starts to walk down the street, past a fruit and vegetable store with open- air-displayed flowers, past several briskly moving pedestrians. With the hymn still playing, the screen goes black briefly. Mickey opens the door, the light from a hallway illuminating him.  He's just entered his apartment.  He closes the door and walks through his dark foyer; he carries a brown bag. He switches on the light, and walking past his spiral staircase, past several framed pictures on the wall, he makes his way to his living room coffee table.  Mickey pulls a crucifix out of the bag; he looks at it, then puts it on the table near a pile of books and some objets d'art.  He then takes out a copy of the New Testament, putting it on top of the crucifix.  Then out comes a framed picture of a saint.  It too gets put on the growing pile.  But the bag is not yet empty.  Next comes a large loaf of Wonder Bread and a large jar of Hellman's mayonnaise.  Mickey sets them on top of the saint.",

(pausing, grinning) God, you really liked it?! \"You Made Me Love You\" starts to play as the movie cuts to the street outside Mickey's apartment house, an old building complete with a red entrance door and a gray, weather-beaten facade.  Trees line the sidewalk.  Holly and Mickey emerge from the door and walk up the street, revealing a whole row of similar apartment buildings.  They pass a few other people as they walk. The film then moves to the outside of a charming glass and stainedwood cafe.  Through the window, Holly and Mickey can be seen having lunch.  Holly is talking animatedly; Mickey takes a sip of coffee.  Some people pass by. Next, the film cuts to an almost isolated path in Central Park, complete, with old-fashioned streetlamps and scattered leaves.  Holly and Mickey stroll into view, deep in conversation.",
