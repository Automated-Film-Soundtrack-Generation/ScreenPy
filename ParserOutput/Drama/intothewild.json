But the divorce never happened, though the threats and meetings never stopped. It wasn't long before Chris and I shut off -- we would tell mom and dad to go ahead and get the divorce. Chris and I just wanted to get away from their fights and mom kept promising to get out and take us with her as soon as their company made enough money. Dad had been the young genius [that] NASA enlisted to do [crucial] designs for the American satellite radar systems that would be our answer to the Russian Sputnik. And mom and he later started up a consulting firm combining her get-up- and-go resourcefulness with his wealth of knowledge. By the time the company actually made its first million, the careerism and money seemed to erase her memory of the promise she'd made us. (MORE)",

As he moves to the glowing embers of what remains of the campfire, Rainey's face goes out of frame and all Chris can see are his booted feet, tapping bits of glowing wood into the center of the fire.

There on the beach, Jan and Rainey's van, their tent, and the fireless coals of last night. But no sign of Chris, his bag or his tent. Jan appears from her tent, rubbing her eyes. She wears a sarong which she re-secures at the breast, then notices that Chris has left. But where his tent had been, the words: THANK YOU JAN AND RAINEY are spelled out in the sand with bits of driftwood. CU: Jan - We see her sadness. Rainey appears at her shoulder.

He can hardly believe he's surviving it as he goes but there's no looking back now. And with every thump of the music, we share his rush. His pure unadulterated exhilaration.

He moves TOWARD CAMERA. We PAN AROUND with him as he walks past, where beyond Chris on the snow plain, rises a tree line. CUT TO: 217   EXT. TEKLANIKA RIVER - DAY                                217 Its banks lined with a jagged shelf of frozen overflow. At its center, a channel of gently flowing water, opaque with glacial till. Beyond the far ice shelf, Chris appears from the riverside treeline. He eases across the ice, then wades through the latte-colored channel and on to the other side. REVERSE ANGLE: Chris moving toward the opposite tree line, he turns back to the gentle river behind. Chris' POV scanning the terrain. From the river to a distant mountain peak and then to a second mountain peak, triangulating his location. He makes a drawing on a pad of paper and piles some medium- sized rocks to mark the spot before moving on into the trees. CUT TO: 218   EXT. VAST ALASKAN SNOWSCAPE - DAY                         218 Total silence across the beatific white vista of snow, mountain, and colorless trees UNTIL a DISTANT ECHOING GUNSHOT. CUT TO: 219   EXT. CAMPSITE, BESIDE SUSHANA RIVER - NIGHT               219 Chris has skinned and is cooking a squirrel. CUT TO: 220   EXT. CAMPSITE, BESIDE SUSHANA RIVER - MORNING             220 Chris packs the last of his camp and begins his march upriver. CUT TO: 125. 221   EXT. UPRIVER - DAY                                        221 As Chris walks upon a clearing in the tree line, he catches his first glimpse of Denali's (Mt. McKinley's) high-blinding white bulwarks. Chris stands in awe. We remain in his WIDE-SHOT POV as it - DISSOLVE TO: SAME SHOT - NIGHT But now Chris' tent sits in its foreground with the moonlit Denali still visible. CUT TO: 222   EXT. WOODS BESIDE RIVER - DAY                             222 CAMERA ANGLED SKYWARD into the broken rays of grey light. We TILT DOWN to find (and TRACK through the trees with) Chris moving along the river, when he sees something just OFF CAMERA. Chris' POV: Through the trees and fireweed, he sees something metallic and rusty. Chris moves up through the underbrush and the snow into the narrow tree line and on into the clearing, where before him: A DERELICT SCHOOL BUS. It is a vintage International Harvester from the 1940's. Chris approaches the bus, lifts the hood a little bit seeing that the engine is gone. As he moves around the vehicle, we see several windows are cracked or missing altogether. The green and white paint is badly oxidized. Weathered lettering: Fairbanks City Transit System Bus 142. 223   INT. BUS                                                  223 Broken whiskey bottles litter the floor. Chris may well have found his new home. The bus is outfitted with a bunk and a barrel stove. Previous visitors had left it stocked with matches, bug dope, and other essentials. 224   EXT. BUS                                                  224 We follow Chris back out of the bus, surveying the area of the clearing. He loves what he sees. 126. CELEBRATORY MUSIC OVER: He runs up a berm to look down into the river. He runs from corner to corner of this \"Magic Bus\" area like a new bride surveying her honeymoon suite with glee. He climbs a tree, swings from its branch, doing a flip in the air, landing on his feet, but then slipping on the snow and onto his butt and then onto his back. He grabs a handful of snow, shoves it in his mouth, melts it into water, and swallows it. CRANE SHOT:   We PULL UP from Chris to high above the clearing. MUSIC FADES OUT CUT TO: 225   INT./EXT. BUS                                              225 He re-enters the bus and pulls his pen from his pocket, scribbling on the wall of the bus:",

As Chris exits the treeline, there she is: The Teklanika at full flood. Seventy-five foot wide banks, replacing the narrow ice canal of four months earlier. Snowmelt from glaciers high in the Alaska range, its opaque glacial sediment the color of wet concrete. And what had been a distant rumble in the woods, now had the volume and power of a freight train, a seventy-five foot wide one. Chris grabs a hold of a riverside branch and takes one slow, careful step into the river. Without mercy, WHAM! the river kicks his feet out from under him! The branch he holds SNAPS! By some miracle, his hands move like lightening and he grabs a lower, sturdier branch below, saving himself from a certain death. 135.

He reads the page to its conclusion and as almost an afterthought, turns the page to see if there might be more. The word - POISON jumps off the page at him. The book describes the tiny green seeds of the potato root and warns that those with: lateral veins, such as those invisible on the leaflets of wild sweet peas are poisonous.
