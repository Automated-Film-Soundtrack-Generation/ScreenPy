Elegant gardens on the opposite bank embracing the monotonous solemnity of the New Town, tower steeples silhouetted against the sombre sky. An empty motor bus rattles along a deserted street. A Gothic bridge links the two halves of the strange city. Its half-moon arches becoming circles as they meet their reflections in the water.  Thin mist swirls over the cobblestones above. A few boats in the water.  Fishermen casting their lines in silence.  One or two lights now burning in buildings beyond. In the Old Town Square the great clock on the cathedral strikes six.",

Eduard edges away ever so slowly, keeping his unblinking gaze on the archway, backing off, one arm brushing the notice board as he feels his way along it, macabre images on the posters, some torn and incomplete, revealing other fragments behind, Eduard's eyes staring constant, no noise here at all and -- A HAND!  clamps over his face from behind.  All of a sudden and out of absolutely nowhere and not a thing he can do about it. But he tries, his hands coming up to grip the arm that grasps him, an arm of iron. The hand is huge.  It covers Eduard's face almost entirely, only one eye gaping bloodshot through the fingers, ghastly fingers that, just for a second, seem almost inhuman, perhaps even fingers that seem incompatible on the same hand, a hand covered in scar tissue, starting to squeeze as it pulls Eduard swiftly away.",

They're at the river's edge, all running wildly, slipping and stumbling, every man for himself, as they desperately try to escape from whatever madness is closing in behind them. Now from out of the tunnel appears their pursuer, seen only from the back, literally shaking with insane, involuntary, howling LAUGHTER.  A horrific human hyena, far further gone than the sad wretches he's cornered here on this foul, moss-covered ledge in the cold wind. Seeing him, the vagrants freeze in their various positions -- then turn in panic to flee again as he starts after them, moving like an animal, a killer predator, laughing horribly as he goes. The First Vagrant, propelled by fright, manages to make a stunning leap up a wall to grab onto some overhanging chains and pull himself up.  The Second Vagrant finds himself trapped at the edge of the ledge -- with the Laughing Man choosing him as the one to go after first.  He turns and jumps into the river.  The Laughing Man, face still unseen, turns toward the climbing vagrant instead -- who clambers over the top just in time as the Laughing Man's fingernails claw the moldy wall beneath him. The Third Vagrant has made it to some steps, and down them -- glancing back to see the Laughing Man coming after him -- to the small patch of muddy beach at the bottom, grey river water lapping at his ragged shoes.  He doesn't know what to do -- he doesn't know how to swim!  The Laughing Man is running down the steps now.  The Vagrant starts wading out into the water, crying out in fear as the HOWLS behind him come closer and closer -- he throws himself forward, splashing vainly -- and feels the Laughing Man grabbing his ankles, pulling him back. The Vagrant's screams join the Laughing Man's insane giggles as they thrash around violently in the water.  The Laughing Man drags the Vagrant back to the beach, then back up the Steps, the Vagrant struggling helplessly, his head banging from step to step, his hands flailing around but finding nothing to clutch onto, his screaming going unheeded in this lonely part of the sleeping city. The Laughing Man drags him on, back to the slippery ledge and along it, dragging the Vagrant on his back through a filthy sewer alongside the wall, the Vagrant's cries choked by the stagnant water, but continuing as the Laughing Man drags him back into the dark tunnel, under the bridge, the two of them disappearing into the blackness again, their combined",

He sees the Laborer replace the knife in its sheath on his belt, then help Mr. Pick drag the Strange Man off to some side shadows where they dump him.

And its owner's arms now come through to stretch after Kafka. Kafka beats them back with the umbrella while still trying to pull the unyielding gate open.  The Maniac yelps as Kafka bashes the umbrella up at him, dodging his head out of the way each time the umbrella sweeps back at him, swinging his thick arms wildly to ward off blows and try and snatch the umbrella for himself.  He finally retreats under the barrage of blows and Kafka quickly takes the opportunity to lever open the gate with the umbrella. The Maniac's face reappears overhead.  Kafka stabs the umbrella up at him some more -- and the Maniac manages to grab it.  Kafka sits down on the elevator edge to jump down to the ground floor and -- THE MANIAC Lunges forward from above, scooping both arms down in a vain attempt to catch Kafka just as he drops out of sight -- landing on the ground floor with a roll. The Maniac HOWLS at his failure, his features even more horribly contorted, Practically filling the small opening of the roof hatch as he SHRIEKS.  And as his atrocious face comes CLOSER and CLOSER and CLOSER -- one of his eyeballs falls out! -- POP! -- out of the socket suddenly -- dangling into the elevator, hanging by a single sinewy bloody thread. The Maniac cries out and reaches for the eyeball, bringing it back up to try and stuff back in place ...",

A sliver of light gives it away -- and on the other side of it he hears FOOTSTEPS. But they pass by. There's another sliver of light indicating another door in the books opposite him.  He walks over and pulls on the shelves.  Here the dark wood is merely a disguising cover for the shiny modern steel he discovers on the other side of it And he finds more than that as he enters -- THE LABORATORY A real mad scientist's workshop.  Chemicals of bizarre colors rush and FIZZ through mazes of glass pipes and beakers, in some places boiling and steaming, in others frosting or freezing.  Circuits and test tubes flash and glow as sparks and filamentary arcs CRACKLE with electric incandescence. insane instruments and devices, interconnected with complex wires, perform strange and villainous functions.  It's the most modern setting we've yet seen -- but at the same time all this futuristic technology seems somehow archaic, as if put together from old, familiar materials and elements, both eccentric and eclectic. The chain that runs through the floors of the Castle carrying documents runs up and down through the laboratory too. Amidst this feast for the eyes, what Kafka now focuses in on a simple cigarette -- left smoking in an ashtray.  And by the look of the ash, not very long ago.  Kafka looks around anxiously -- notices an archway leading to another room.",

She's strong, though, made more so by her madness.  She forces him down to the ground, straddling him, the knife pushing closer.  Kafka gasps in pain, finally succumbs, no longer able to hold his hand up in defense, simply shutting his eyes with a terrible sigh to await the fatal stab. It doesn't come.  Almost.  But not quite.  Gabriela's arm pauses, shaking in the cool, cloudy air, her sleeve trembling in the breeze off the River, the sharp blade, inches from Kafka's throat, flashing in the new day's light. Gabriela stares away over the River, the destroyed half of her face in shadow again, the other more strikingly beautiful than ever.  As Kafka watches, passive, she gets off him and slowly walks to the wall of the bridge, letting the knife drop from her hand along the way.  Kafka manages to lift himself to his knees, clutching his wound.  He looks up. Gabriela in one graceful movement climbs over the wall and throws herself into the River. Kafka lowers his head.",
