Algren, Gant, and the Japanese Offi cers call out orders but all discipline soon breaks down -- it is every man for himself-- The battle swirls ever ywhere around us. Fleeing soldiers are run through by lances, run down and trampled by horses. Each samurai wears individual, vibrantly col ored armor. Various battle flags sweep through the fog. Gant uses his two cavalry revolvers -- firing constantly -- finally out of ammo he drops from his horse in the cavalry st yle and pulls a Winchester repeating rifle, crouching and quickly firing-- Algren uses his revol ver first -- firing as he turns on his horse -- when the revol ver is empty he pulls his cavalry saber. He manages to parry the lethal blows as the Samurai hurtle past -- But one Samurai, his armor all in black, comes at him on a collision course and SLAMS INTO HIM, sending both horse and rider to the ground. Algren scrambles to his feet, his saber nowhere to be found as another rider heads toward him carrying a lance. Algren manages to grab it and throw the rider to the ground, wrestling the lance from his grip and running him through. In the midst of the battle we notice a peculiar thing. One samurai is just sitting on his horse. Watching Algren. This samurai wears a BLACK MASK. The MASKED SAMUARI watches Algren fight. Algren now wields the lance to battle the horsemen as they sweep past. He spears one and then unseats another. When a third samurai cuts his lance in half, Algren uses the remaining half as a club to take him down. The Masked Samurai continues to watch Algren. Algren's tenacity is amazing. He continues to fight with heroic passion, refusing to give an inch, long after Those around him have fled. Then a blaze of bright yellow  a samurai in yellow armor galloping past, firing arrows steadily from horseback. His control and speed are astounding. We will come to know him as YORITOMO, a handsome young samurai. Yoritomo fires arrow upon arrow  the speed is breathtaking  Two arrows slam into Gant, knocking him to the ground. The battle, meanwhile, has become a rout. Those Imperial soldiers who fight are easily cut down. Those who flee are run down like prey. Left alone, Algren finds himself confronted by ashigaru  samurai foot soldiers carrying pikes. He turns to discover his retreat cut off by other 34. samurai wielding katana  the lethal long sword. But rather than give any quarter, Algren launches an attack. He kills one samurai before he is RUN THROUGH, at the shoulder, by a lance. In agony, Algren SNAPS OFF the hilt of the lance, leaving its tip buried deep in his chest, and fights on. He manages to parry a blow  which SLICES into his side. The next blow takes off a piece of his scalp. Blood fl ows down his faces and into his eyes. Algren is now surrounded by ten samurai. A man's heroic stand against certain death is of great interest to them. As they begin to close in, Algren whirls the lance around, a tattered battle-flag with TIGER INSIGNIA still dangling from the end. The MASKED SAMURAI removes his mask. It is the JAPANESE MAN, whose dream of the tiger we glimpsed at the beginning of the story. His eyes wide in surprise, he watches his dream come to life--the blue tiger holding the dogs at bay. In SLOW MOTION Algren whirls the lance, as one samurai, wearing BLOOD-RED ARMOR, advances. With a murderous smile, he draws his katana. Algren seems spent  he drops to one knee, swaying, on the brink of losing consciousness. . But as the RED SAMURAI, lets out a battle cry and propels himself forward for the death blow - Algren suddenly LEAPS UP and propels the jagged wooden end of the broken lance into the unprotected throat of his attacker. As the samurai falls, the rest of his comrades close in to cut Algren off. A harsh COMMAND stops them in their tracks. The Masked Samurai leaps from his horse. Everyone steps aside deferentially so that be might pass by without being jostled.                    . He looks down at Algren, then removes his battle helmet. And we meet _MORI KATSUMOTO, the leader of the samurai. He it an imposing man of about Algren's years. Sensing that he is about to be killed, Algren pulls himself t o his knees, and SWINGS his saber at Katsumoto. With blinding speed, Katsumoto pulls his katana from its scabbard. Algren's saber is SNAPPED CLEANLY IN TWO. Katsumoto looks down at Algren. Then Gant appears behind Katsumoto -- limping toward him, cocking his rifle, urgently trying to save Algren-- Ujio, (the Samurai we saw earlier on the streets of Tokyo) leaps to protect his Lord. His sword flashes-- 35. Gant is eviscerated. Algren watches in horror. A dreadful beat as Gant stands, pathetically trying to hold his guts in. Then he sinks to his knees. Katsumoto turns, leaps back onto his horse and trots off. Algren finally wrenches himself from under his horse. He crawls to Gant, blood pouring from his own injured back and shoulder. Gant is dead. Algren looks up to see the battle is lost. The Japanese soldiers have fled. Or are surrendering, injured or dead. And he sees one other thing. General Yoshitaka is still on his horse, head down. He has not pulled his sword. He has not been hurt. Katsumoto rides to Yoshitaka. A few serious words are exchanged. Katsumoto bows his bead in respect, seems to agree to something. Both men climb from their horses. General Yoshitaka pulls out a small b1ade and hands it to Katsumoto, who holds it out firmly. General Yoshitaka quickly and calmly pulls himself on to the blade, plunging it into his stomach, embracing Katsumoto. It is seppuku -- the traditional form of samurai suicide. Algren watches, stunned. Then a terrible scream cuts through the battlefield. Algren sees samurai calmly walking among the injured and captured Imperial soldiers .. killing them one by one with a single stroke. Algren looks over the slaughter. And then passes out, bill wounds overcoming him. Fade to... EXT.",

They have incredible control. NAKAO, a mountain of a man, is a Karate master. He stands unarmed, four samurai facing him. They attack with wooden swords. He effortlessly defeats them -- the agility of the huge man is shocking. Kyudo (\"The Way of the Bow\") masters use their bows for target practice. Yoritomo holds a bundle of arrows. In the distance, a line of plums. Algren watches. Yoritomo just seems to stand there, his eyes hall-open. And then -- in a stunning blaze of movement -- Yoritomo fires the arrows -- one after another, amazingly fast -- cleanly hitting each plum. The final arrow splits the previous one as it buries itself in the tree. A wooden sword leans against the porch. Algren idly picks it up, feeling its balance. In a flash, Uji o has raced over and grabbed it from him. Algren stands motionless as Ujio screams at him.",

Kids start walking with them, pointing at his Japanese garb, laughing as he stumbles in his wooden clogs. They pass by Ujio training a group of samurai using wooden kendo swords. Nearby, Higen and Toshiie are imitating the grown-ups, sparring with wooden swords that are much too big for them. Yoritomo watches his nephews proudly, murmuring details of their prowess to Algren, who has no idea what he's talking about. Higen charges his little brother, but goes careening past, right toward Algren, who deftl y dodges out of the wa y. This causes gales of laughter from the boys, one of whom takes Toshiie's sword and offers it to Algren. Algren looks at the sword in his hand and unthinkingly twirls if with a f1ourish -- causing the boys to applaud. Yoritomo bows, and encourages A1gren in Higen's direction. Algren shakes his head politely, but Higen is already on the attack. Algren dodges one thrust, then parries another, as the boys begin to cheer. Suddenly, ever yone goes silent. Algren turns. Ujio is standing behind him, arms folded. Ujio barks a command in Japanese. He wants Algren to drop the sword. It is obvious to Algren what it must mean, but he does nothing. Ujio approaches Algren slowl y. Algren holds the wooden sword casually, only his eyes betraying the tension of the moment. Ujio's wooden sword FLASHES, quicker than the eye can follow. Algren's sword is knocked from his hands, then, somehow in the same fluid movement, Ujio brings the sword around and cracks Algren across the chest hard enough to knock the breath from his body and lend him to his kneels. Satisfied with himself, Uji o starts to walk away, but the expressions of the bystanders cause him to turn back: . Algren is standing again, and again holding the sword. With grim purpose, Uji o returns to Algren, who has assumed a ready pose. Again Ujio's SWORD FLASHES.

Gasping for breath, at least one rib broken, Algren writhes on the ground. Ujio digs the point of his sword into Algren's hand until he releases his grip. Again Ujio kicks the sword away. The ever-enlarging crowd gasps as Algren once again struggles to his feet. This time without hesitation, Uji o runs back and rains blows upon Algren's now defenseless body. First the wrist, then the back, then the stomach, then finally the head. Algren hits the ground, unconscious, his fingers still clutching the sword.

Algren ends with the edge of his wooden sword It Ujio's throat. The other samurai watch. Amazed. Algren twirls his sword in a fancy cavalry \"fl ourish.\" The pride he has alwa ys taken in his swordsmanship has been restored. He bows to Uji o.

Then he stabs THROUGH THE SCREEN -as a blood- stain SPREADS across the pastoral painting. But another Ninja catches Algren off-guard and slices at him with his short sword. As Algren lifts his sword to parry the blow, HIS LITILE FINGER IS CHOPPED OFF. He drops the sword, momentarily defenseless. Across the hallway Yoritomo has been watching the shadowpla y on the rice-paper walls. Algren's attacker raises his blade to deliver the death blow. In Katsumoto's room Algren flinches involuntarily beneath the raised blade. Suddenly the Ninja JACKKNIFES as if punched by an unseen hand. As he spins, dead, to the ground, we SEE an ARROW lodged bet ween his shoulder blades. Yoritomo has FIRED blindly, through the wall killing Algren's attacker. Nearby, a Ninja hurls a throwing star at Katsumoto. With blind instinct Katsumoto turns and takes the blade in the meat of his arm. Algren, meanwhile, has ripped the sleeve of his kimono into a tourniquet for his maimed hand. He uses the rest of the fabric TO TIE HIS HAND TO HIS SWORD before launching himself back into the fray -- slicing an attacker just as he is about to impale Katsumoto. Together, he and Katsumoto force the last two Ninjas through a paper wall to the next room. They fight all the wa y through that room and BLAST through another paper wall to the next.",

Everything happens so fast it is hard to tell just what has taken place. In the strobing shadows, all we really know is that Algren has leapt to the attack. Within seconds, four bodies lie in the street Algren holds bloody sword. His face is cut and a sleeve of his jacket is ripped, but other than that he is unharmed. Ujio has taught him welt As he stands, catching his breath, we HOLD on his face in CLOSE-UP. A sudden flash: We see Algren grab one of the torches and smash it across the ronin's face. It is the attack  replayed in real-time. Rolling to avoid a death-blow, he grabs the fallen man's sword and eviscerates attacker #2. The two remaining Ronin strike. He parries the blow of attacker #3, whirls to slice the legs of attacker #4, whirls again to cut off the hand of attacker #1, who has returned to the attack. Meanwhile, attacker #3 serums and charges -- just lit attacker #4 is trying to stand. Algren steps back as attacker #3 impales attacker #4. Algren steps forward and cuts off the head of attacker #3. Even now, it has happened too fast to be truly appreciated. BACK TO THE STREET We move, closer-still on Algren's face. A sudden flash: And so we watch the attack again. in super-slow motion now, so we can fully appreciate it's terrible beauty. A torch smashes across a face. A sword slices the sleeve of a coat. Sparks fly as two swords meet. 89. A severed hand falls in the dirt. Blood sprays from a decapitated head. A sword is wiped clean. BACK TO THE STREET In real time, Algren kneels to examine one of the dead Ronin. On his arm is tattooed a familiar emblem: The sign of the Omura Zaibatsu EXT.",
