Lesser-known actors, agents and executives of all ages. Into this bar comes Ben. Ben is in his thirties. He is wearing an Armani suit that could use a visit to the dry-cleaner's. He hasn't shaved in the last twenty-four hours (but neither has any of the actors in the bar). He is a good-looking man but is clearly in trouble of some kind. Although still in control of his faculties, it becomes clear in the following scene that he is much the worse for wear with drink. He looks around the room until he sees someone he recognizes and then walks over to a table where two couples are seated. The men are young execs, the girls, both blonde and busty, have very white teeth and smile all of the time. The camera follows Ben over to the table. One of the execs looks up as Ben gets close. He recognizes him but delays his recognition until the last moment in the hope that Ben is not looking at him.",

Heads turn as she passes a group of businessmen and it's clear they find her very sexy. She acknowledges their glance with a half-smile and steps into the elevator.

Ben finishes his drink and grimaces before indicating to the barman that he'd like a repeat. Barman pours him a whiskey - Cranberry - and the camera moves in closer to Ben, ending in a close-up. Ben takes a big hit from the drink and concentrates on the TV. We hear from the TV sound that it is a word game with a big prize. Ben smiles to himself.",

There were three or four small naked children playing on the floor and we had to step over them to get into the room. The room had a bed and a dresser. He lay on his back on the bed and I put a rubber on him and sucked him for a while until he was hard and then I eased on to him. About twenty minutes later there was a knock on the door and it was the woman saying our time was up. I felt kind of guilty because he hadn't come and I offered to reason with the woman and get another ten minutes, but he said it was all right and began dressing. When we were ready to leave the room he stopped me and... hugged me and kissed me on the cheek. He gave me an extra hundred as a tip and went back to his car. I remember being relieved that I wouldn't have to work again that evening.",
