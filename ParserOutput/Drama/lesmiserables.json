The first thing he sees by the light of the moon is an image of God the Father gazing down on him from the painted ceiling. In panic, fearing judgement, he sits bolt upright. Then he looks round, and remembers. He gets out of bed, and opens the door. There, across the narrow passage, the door stands open to the Bishop's bedroom. In the moonlight, he sees the Bishop lying asleep. Above his bed, the cupboard where the silver is kept. Valjean moves silently into the Bishop's room, holding a metal miner's spike which he pulls from his bag. The floor boards creak. He looks down at the old man, holding his breath, but the bishop is peacefully and innocently asleep. He reaches up to the cupboard. It is unlocked. The cupboard door opens with a sharp cracking sound. The Bishop, disturbed in his sleep, moves a little. At once Valjean is over him, like a wild animal, spike raised to strike should he wake. The Bishop sleeps on. The moon comes out and lights up his beautific, smiling face. Valjean is thrown. He turns back and opens the cupboard door fully: there is the silver.",

TRACK LEADING TO FACTORY, MONTREUIL - DAY               24 Valjean and Javert hurry out across the factory yard and down the muddy track beyond to discover - A heavily laden cart has toppled onto the cart driver - Fauchelevent, the worker seen before taking a rest on a crate. The   cart driver and the Foreman are trying to lift the cart off   the crushed man, but it's too heavy, and the ground is too   soft. Fauchelevent screams as the cart slowly sinks in the   mud. Valjean, Javert and Javert's assistant all hurry to help, but they can't get a proper purchase in the spongy ground. All the time the cart is sinking further, pushing Fauchelevent deeper into the mud that will soon bury him. Then Valjean sees a way. At one end the wheels of the cart have stopped sinking - the ground is harder here. He throws himself under the cart at this higher end, and braces himself to lift it from beneath.",

She looks pale and sickly, but still attempts an alluring smile. She moves past the anchored ships, beneath the bowsprits, trying pathetically to attract custom. Then she comes to a stop, staring. She has seen and recognised Valjean, some way off. He's out in the harbour district. He is talking to a beggar. Before he moves on, he hands over some money. As Fantine watches Valjean on his mission of mercy, a well- dressed young man, BAMATABOIS, comes up to her. He arrives with two friends and a valet.",

PLACE DE LA BASTILLE, PARIS - DAY                       51 SUPERIMPOSE CAPTION: Nine years later The dawn light glows on a massive ELEPHANT. The monument, made of wood and plaster, now ruined and crumbling, stands on a plinth on one side of the wide open square. On the far side, the remains of the great fortress that was the Bastille. In the middle, scaffolding surrounds a half-built triumphal column, which is being erected to celebrate the new regime. SUPERIMPOSE CAPTION: Paris, 1832. The streets that run from the square lead in one direction to the Paris of power and wealth; in the other direction into the slums. The camera sweeps in and down to meet the elephant. A head pops out of one of the elephant's many holes - GAVROCHE, a street urchin. He gives a shrill whistle. At once a dozen more street urchins show themselves, from every crack in the monument's skin. Agile as a monkey, Gavroche drops to the ground, followed by his band. 52   EXT.

These are the conveyances of the rich, fine gilded coaches with matched horses and footmen on the back. Virtually at a standstill, they lend Gavroche a platform as he leaps from coach to coach, a street urchin dancing on the heads of the elite.

Once it passes Marius sees two people in the street outside. One is an old gentleman, Valjean. The other is a beautiful young girl, Cosette. The two are giving alms to beggars as they walk back from evening church service. Marius can't take his eyes off Cosette. He's never seen anyone so lovely in his life. We hear the instrumental foreshadowing of `A Heart Full of Love'. As if drawn by Marius's gaze, Cosette looks up and meets his eyes. She too is amazed: he's looking at her as if he already knows her. A second carriage breaks their held gaze. Marius continues on down the street and when he looks back, at that precise moment Cosette looks at him again. Valjean instinctively puts his arm round her, guarding her jealously from this distant boy's gaze. We cut further down the street to an alleyway where the Thenardiers, heavily disguised, are waiting for Valjean's approach with their gang of crooks, Babet, Brujon, Clacquesous, Montparnasse.",
