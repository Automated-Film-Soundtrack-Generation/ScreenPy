A diagram is made to reflect the narration...this is done like NFL coverage where the x's and o's and arrows and lines are drawn to indicate placement and moves, etc.) An x appears on the top of the building over Sydney. NARRATOR Sydney Barringer jumps from the ninth floor rooftop -- His parents argue three stories below -- An o is marked to indicate their position. Image goes into MOTION with Sydney jumping...an ARROW is drawn that displays the PATH of his fall -- NARRATOR Her accidental shotgun blast hits Sydney in the stomach as he passes the arguing sixth floor window -- Freeze Frame shows Sydney, hanging mid-air -- the glass shattering and starting to fall to the ground -- an X marks the spot where he is hit. NARRATOR He is killed instantly but continues to fall -- only to find, three stories below -- a safety net installed three days prior for a set of window washers that would have broken his fall and saved his life if not for the hole in his stomach. A squiggly line with an arrow is drawn from Sydney to the net to indicate the path -- UNFREEZE frame and watch Sydney fall into the net",

It reads: \"No Pussy Has Nine Lives\". FRANK And you did hear me right.  Tame it. Take it on, head first -- with your skills at work and say, \"No.  You will not control me.  You will not take my soul and you will not win this game.\" 'cause it is a game, guys, you wanna think it's not -- go back to the schoolyard and have a crush on Mary Jane -- respect the cock -- you are embedding this thought: I'm in charge.  I'm the one who says yes, no, now or here.  Shit, man.  Sad but true. Sad But True.  And you wanna know what? It must be the way. The thing about chicks and the thing about this course that we're going through today is how universal the whole thing is.  I mean: I wish I could sit here and say that it's not -- because the reality ? If each chick had something new, something really new that I'd never seen before? Fuckin' hell: I'd be in the money!  Because I'd have to create a hundred new cassettes, a hundred new books, a hundred new seminars and hundred new videos just to deal with each and every situation a chick could create - but that is just not the case.  They are universal. They are sheep. They are to be studied and watched -- they have patterns that must be stopped, interupted and resisted. I'd be makin' a fuckin' butt load if they were actually as much of a challenge as they want you to think they are! Reality: They Are All The Same. Each and every one of them.  And once you learn these methods: You're Set.  You Don't Have To Come Back. That's it. In solid. Boom.  Done.  Over.  Why? Because all women are the same.  Period. End of discussion.  Sorry.  It's true.  Sad But True. And anyone who wants to say that these methods we work by are \"unfair?\"  Yes, they are. Guilty as charged.  And so's the world. It's a harsh, hard unfair place, but it's not gonna stop me from getting my fair shair of hair pie -- Period.  Sorry.  End of discussion.",

As far as the morphine pills go, there is something else to consider that can take the pain away that he is in, there is a very strong and very potent solution of liquid morphine....it's a little bottle, with an eye dropper and it's easy to get in his mouth and drop on his tounge and it will certainly diminish the pain that he is in but you have to realize that once you give it to him; there really is no coming back, I mean, it will certainly cure his pain, but he will float in and out of consciousness, even worse than he is now, Linda.  I mean, any sign of the recognizable Earl will pretty much go away -- LINDA -- how the fuck can I say anything to that -- I don't know what to say to that -- DR. LANDON The job here is to make him as comfortable as possible -- right now -- our job is to just try and make it as painless as possible. Right?  You understand?

If you had a job you'd probably understand, but I see you like listenin' to your music and that's fine, you're just gonna wanna keep it down at a certain volume, maybe memorize what number you see on the dial and just always put it to that -- If it's the middle of the day -- that's what I do -- just put it on two and a half and that's a good listening level, alright? I see you like listenin' to your music loud, but, hey, forget about the neighbors, you end up damaging your own ears ok? CLAUDIA Yeah. JIM KURRING Arlight, then.  Cheers. They clink coffee cups.

I have found a way to take any subjective human experience -- in other words -- all the terrible shit or all the great shit that you've had happen to you in your life -- and quickly and easily transform it in the unconscious mind through the subtle and cunning use of language.  The \"listener-patient\" (in other words: The Chick) settles into a very light, very delicate, conversationally induced state: NOT A TRANCE, mind you, but a STATE. A state that is brand new.  The System's state. What did I do?  I REALIZED that concept and put it into practical \"get my dick hard and fuck it\" use. I'm gonna build a state for the seducer and the seducee to live, vote, breath, pay takes and party 'till dawn.  I'm gonna teach methods of language that will help anyone get a piece of ass, tit and tail -- GWENOVIER Let's talk about -- FRANK I just realized this is for television, isn't it?

Phil..do you know her? PHIL No. EARL ...Lily...? PHIL No. EARL She's my love...my life...love of it... In school when you're 12 years old. In school, in six grade....and I saw her and I didn't go to that school...but we met. And my friend knew her...I would say, \"What's that girl?\"  \"How's that Lily?\" \"Oh, she's a bad girl...she sleeps with guys...\"  My friend would say this....but then sometime...I went to another school, you see? But then...when high school at the end, what's that?  What is that?  When you get to the end? PHIL Graduation? EARL No, no, the grade...the grade that you're in? PHIL Twelve. EARL Yeah...So I go to her school for that for grade twelve...and we meet...she was fuckin...like a doll...porcelain doll...and the hips...child bearing hips...y'know that?  So beautiful. But I didn't have sex with anyone, you know?  I was not...I couldn't do anything...always scared, y'know... she was...she had some boyfriends...they liked her y'know...but I didn't like that. I couldn't get over that I wasn't a man, but she was a woman. Y'see?  Y'see I didn't make her feel ok about that....I would say, \"How many men you been with?\" She told me, I couldn't take it...take that I wasn't a man....because if I hadn't had sex with women...like as many women as she had men...then I was weak...a boy.... But I loved her...you understand? ....well, of course, I wanted to have sex with her...and I did and we were together....we met...age twelve, but then again...age seventeen...something, somethin... I didn't let her forget that I thought she was a bad...a slut.....a slut I would call her and hit her....I hit her for what she did...but we married...Lily and me and we married...but I cheated on her...over and over and over again...because I wanted to be a man and I couldn't let her be a woman...a smart, free person who was something...my mind then, so fuckin' stupid, so fuckin....jesus christ, what would I think...did I think....? ...for what I've done...She's my wife for thirty eight years...I went behind her... over and over...fucking asshole I am that I would go out and fuck and come home and get in her bed and say \"I love you...\"  This'z Jack's mother. His mother Lily...these two that I had and I lost .... and this is the regret that you make...the regret you make is the something that you take...blah...blah...blah... something, something..... (beat) Gimme a cigarettee? Through the following Phil tries to give Earl a cigarette, which Earl can't get to his mouth, but then mimes that he's smoking as he starts to get more and more delusional, etc. EARL She had cancer...from her...in her stomach and I didn't go anywhere with her...and I didn't do a god thing... for her and to help her....shit...this bitch...the beautiful, beautiful bitch with perfect skin and child bearing hips and so soft...her namewasLilysee? (beat, fading) He liked her though he did, his mom, Frank/Jack...he took care of her and she died. She didn't stick with him and he thinks and he hates me, ok...see...I'm...that's then what you get? ....are you still walkin' in that car...?",

(beat) People think if I make a judgment call that it's a judgment on them...but that's not what I do and that's not what should be done...I have to take everything and play it as it lays. Sometimes people need a little help. Sometimes people need to be forgiven and sometimes they need to go to jail. And that's a very tricky thing on my part...making that call...the law is the law and heck if I'm gonna break it...but you can forgive someone....?  Well, that's the tough part....What Do We Forgive?

She's sitting up in bed, covers around her, staring into space....a SONG plays....for a very, very long time she doesn't move until she looks up and sees someone enter her bedroom....a FIGURE from the back enters FRAME and walks in and sits on the edge of the bed....from the back it is clear that it's Jim Kurring.
