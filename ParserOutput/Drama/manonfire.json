A 200 pound Guardian removes his T-shirt before serving. Turns to reveal a huge tattoo across two-thirds of his back. Creasy registers his prey. EXT. BARRIO SUNSET A small Russian Taurus crests a hill and descends into Hell. A frightening looking Barrio. Burnt out cars and dead dogs line the sidewalks. Creasy tails the Guardian on his moped into the center of a trash dump. The focal point being a semi-derelict church within a gated compound. Our 'tattooed handball genius' exits the Taurus. Reaches in back for the groceries. INT.   GUARDIA DE SEGUIDAD - SUNSET A knock. GUARDIAN TWO steps over, carries a pistol.     He slides back a speakeasy slot to reveal our tattooed Guardian.",
