STEPHEN is mesmerized by it. He lets go of the rail, leaning forward to get a better view. At the same time across from STEPHEN on the opposite gangway, HOWARD and two or three marines open fire on the bird. The bird drops low, flying right by STEPHEN. Again a crackle of gunfire, but the bird is apparently uninjured, and it banks away, skimming the surface of the water. STEPHEN sags to the deck. A shout. People running.

On his shirt a red smudge has appeared. His wound has begun to bleed again. Ignoring this, Stephen pushes on after his quarry. 244.   THE ROCKY SLOPE Near the top, STEPHEN pauses to catch his breath and glances above him. Again the bird, moving higher, as if leading him on. STEPHEN gets down on all fours, crawling cautiously to the crest just above him. 245.   TOP OF THE HEADLAND A clearing. There is movement in the bushes. STEPHEN slowly rises, climbs the few paces to the hilltop and enters a clearing. He searches amongst the bushes. Nothing. He turns and looks back down the hillside to see BLAKENEY and PADEEN far below, then sits to get his breath back again. STEPHEN'S P.O.V: on the ground between his feet, a beetle. He picks it up. Close, on his hand. It is the same type of beetle BLAKENEY gave him aboard the Surprise. Smiling at the coincidence STEPHEN raises the tiny creature to eye level. His P.O.V.: the beetle, the creature in sharp focus, behind it the sea, and on the sea, a black shape. The focus shifts to the background - a ship at anchor in a bay. The beetle flies away as STEPHEN stares out at the ship. It's the Acheron, and they are weighing anchor. 246.",

Among them are DOUDLE, BOYLE, ALLEN and HORNER in quick succession. The attack momentarily falters, and the Acherons surge back at them. JACK rallies his men and they charge again - the marine, TROLLOPE, and NAGEL are blown backwards by grapeshot. LAMB, enraged, surges past NAGEL's body, swinging his axe to devastating effect, with HOLLAR by his side and JEMMY DUCKS protecting their rear, a pistol in each hand, firing from the hip.
