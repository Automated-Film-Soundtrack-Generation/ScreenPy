The white guy digs a punch deep into the black guy's ribs, and the black guy slams a double left hook into the white guy's belly, making him back up and say -- WHITE BOXER You hit hard -- for a cook. The black guy rushes the white guy, only to catch a right cross that wobbles his knees and makes him stagger, with a fresh cut over his right eye.  The white guy now rushes in, and the black guy (his name is DORIE MILLER) throws an upper cut that drops his opponent like a sack of rocks. The sailors cheer wildly.

In a QUICK CUT, Rafe's body is laid out on the deck of the trawler.  The crewmen think he's dead.  His body is stiff, his lips white; and they say so, in Norwegian... But one of the other crewmen notices a quiver in his eyelid, then quickly covers Rafe with his on wool peacoat and presses back an eyelid to see his pupils.  Rafe's white lips move. The crewmen realize he's trying to say something. And Rafe does utter something, barely audible; something the Norwegian crewmen don't understand.",

Debris from the Arizona also cover the Tennessee and does more damage than the two Japanese bombs that hit her.",

And Rafe starts moving, being dragged on his back, pulled by his feet along the rocky sand. His hand slides by the pistol he tossed behind the rock. The whole world slows down. He clutches it, shoots one of the men towing Danny.  And as the man dragging Rafe turns around, Rafe shoots him in the face. The officer spins, raising his rifle; the soldier pulling Red, shoves him onto his face in the sand and aims his rifle too.  The officer is pulling the trigger to kill Rafe when Danny slams him down from behind. The fourth soldier shoots Danny in the gut, then takes aim for Rafe's heart -- and is shot through the chest from behind. The Japanese officers rises in surprise and is cut down by scythes carried by the Chinese peasant soldiers who are just arriving. Rafe struggles to Danny, moving the Chinese aside.

Thirteen planes crash landed in China, where the Chinese people helped the Americans escape, and had their villages destroyed and citizens executed by the Japanese forces of occupation.  Two crews were captured by the Japanese and three fliers were executed without trial, called \"war criminals\" by the Japanese.  Jimmy Doolittle was promoted to General, and given the medal of honor.",
