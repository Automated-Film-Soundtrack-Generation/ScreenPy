It has not been without visitors. There are footprints on the sand and some of the boards have been pulled back. ADA passes BAINES, walking urgently towards it. Soon, ADA has removed enough boards that she may lift the lid and play the keys. EMNES stays back. ADA takes great delight in feeling her fingers on the keys again. Her whole composition is altered. She is animated, joyful, excited. Down on the wet sand FLORA does a wild dance of her own invention using a seaweed wig. She finishes by rolling down the beach in the sand. BAINES views them with suspicion, yet he is magnetically drawn to the spectacle He has never seen women behave with so much abandon. His attention fixes on ADA's uninhibited emotional playing, and as he watches, he finds himself edging irresistibly closer.

ADA notices him come towards them with the boards, obviously intending that they should leave. Her mood darkens, she continues playing stubbornly even though FLORA has stopped. Abruptly she finishes. In black spirits she replaces her cape and bonnet. BAINES is struck by this sudden change, he watches her mesmerised as he replaces the boards.

STEWART watches, stepping down to peer lower as BAINES buries into ADA's skirt. He does not seem to notice the dog licking his hand.

ADA's expression is critical and distant. Taking a cloth she begins to clean and polish the piano. Her finger holds down one of the keys and we glimpse an old inscription on its side, a small heart, and an arrow. Putting the cloth aside she sits at the piano to begin playing. She starts with wholehearted feeling, her eyes closed, but before long she is surprised by a moving reflection across the piano and she 'starts', glancing over her shoulder. She stops and begins again. But once more a reflex has her glance across her left shoulder and she pauses in her playing. Disquieted she starts again and again she looks away. She stops, confused, unable to go on, unable to getup, one hand on the lid and one on the piano keys.

ADA signs. Her black shadow behind the sheet recalls the macabre play. No! The little girl continues defiantly with her miniature washing. ADA rips the washing line up and flings it aside. FLORA is shocked, stunned. She takes the key and walking off she turns and shouts.",
