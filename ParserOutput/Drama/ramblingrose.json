He looks around cautiously, then picks up the mattress of his bed. He pushes it far back and we see springs. He takes out a small \"book\" or pamphlet and stares gravely at it. CLOSE-UP: The front cover of the pamphlet. We see the overall title: LITTLE DIRTY COMIC BOOKS. And beneath it: BLONDIE AND DAGWOOD. And beneath that, in smaller letters: \"Mr. Dithers Comes to Dinner -- and How!\" We see Buddy's hands in the shot, and he opens the pamphlet and we catch enough of a glimpse of the thing to know it is pretty awful -- a drawing maybe of \"Blondie\" stark naked with a finger in her mouth going, \"Tee-Hee!\" ON Buddy, as he stares down with grave intentness at the Little Dirty Comic Book. Slyly now, he retraces his steps to the bureau and takes out a flashlight. He goes back to the bed, switches off the lamp, gets in the bed and turns on the flashlight and pulls the covers over his head. We hear a faint SOUND on the track and Buddy suddenly yanks back the covers, puts the flashlight on the table by the bed and throws the Little Dirty Comic Book under the bed. He lies on pillow and pretends he's asleep, and we hear the door of his room OPEN and a CREAKING on the floor. ANOTHER ANGLE, on a weepy Rose in a very thin nightgown. The shot is FROM BELOW as Buddy might see her as she stands over his bed. She looks very lonely and unhappy and is half crying.",

She has no bra and her breasts are half visible, the nipples denting the material. It is pretty wild for 1935.
