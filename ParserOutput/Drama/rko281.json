WELLES' SUITE EVENING Orson Welles, elegant and impressive, is flourishing a cigarette and a coin in his magnificently expressive hands He is perfecting a magic trick. Welles is lounging on the bed of an enormous guest suite at San Simeon. He is wearing a tuxedo. In the bathroom beyond him we can see the writer HERMAN MANKIEWICZ (\"MANK\". ) Mank is a wonderful wreck of a human being. 43 years old, but looking considerably older, he is short and squat and bitter. A compulsive gambler and drinker, Mank still glimmers with wry humor that is equally wicked and corrosive. He is incomplete without the stub of a cigar clenched in his teeth. Mank, also dressed in a tuxedo, is looking at himself in the bathroom mirror as he struggles with his bow tie. He occasionally glances in the mirror to Welles.

He is a fully commanding figure, towering in both height (six foot two) and personality. He is shaped rather like a pear and moves with a delicacy surprising for such a famously merciless man. Although the word ruthless does not begin to do justice to the press baron's animus, Hearst is endlessly polite and almost painfully soft-spoken. Marion is 43 years old, a shimmering and lively presence. In a word that might have been coined for her, she has moxie. While the ravages of alcoholism have left their subtle marks on the edges and attitudes of her face, she can still charm and captivate with almost effortless grace. Around Hearst's feet sit a collection of his beloved dachshunds. On the other side of the main table, and down a bit, sit Welles and Mank. We sweep around the table, hearing bits of overlapping dialogue and finally settle on Marion and Hearst. Marion is charming CAROLE LOMBARD and CLARK GABLE, who sit beside her. She tenderly rests one hand on Hearst's arm as she speaks. Marion speaks with an occasionally pronounced stutter.",

He speeds back and forth and back and forth from the set to the camera in the Campaign Headquarters set, never happy with the shot. . . Gregg Toland watches, bemused, as Welles shifts tiny prop pieces on the set. . . Welles bullies and screams and pleads and seduces. Like an obsessed artistic tornado he is seemingly everywhere at once. We see him rejecting matte paintings and in makeup and rewriting the script and trying on costumes and selecting props and leaping into odd positions looking for the perfect camera angle. It is very important in this sequence that we see the pressure building ... building ... building ... on Welles.",

They were all on the old man's yacht taking a nice jaunt from Pedro down to San Diego. Real foggy night it was. This was Hearst, Marion, Ince, Charlie Chaplin, Louella, the usual gorillas. So Hearst notices Marion slip off with Chaplin -- she was screwing everyone then -- and the old man goes nuts. Grabs his revolver and starts shooting. Just like Tom Mix, standing there blasting away through the fog. Boom - - boom -- boom -- and Thomas Ince takes a bullet through the head. So now there's this dead guy lying on the deck. You'll see how this could be quite an embarrassment. So the empire goes into action. Nice and quiet and Ince was cremated lickety-split. No inquest and no police. It was right after this that Hearst gives Louella her life-time contract. Just to keep her all hush-hush. A beat as Mank gazes at Welles. A beat",

Five or six friends are also spread around the room. Joe Willicombe is also present. We watch their faces as they watch CITIZEN KANE During this sequence we hear bits and pieces of KANE as we watch Hearst and Marion react. We see Marion's initial amusement give way to a forced neutrality. We see Hearst becoming increasingly uncomfortable, reacting physically, almost writhing, as his soul is laid bare. Then his face grows cold. Drained. We see Joe Willicombe, offended. We see the other guests, horrified and afraid to even so much as glance at Hearst. Finally, we hear the ending of the movie:",
