But these circumstances are far from normal. He is disheveled, unshaven, and very drunk. A cigarette smolders in his mouth. His eyes, flinty and hard, are riveted to the bungalow up the path. He can hear them fucking from here. He raises a bottle of bourbon and knocks it back. The radio plays softly, painfully romantic, taunting him: You stepped out of a dream... You are too wonderful... To be what you seem... He opens the glove compartment, pulls out an object wrapped in a rag. He lays it in his lap and unwraps it carefully -- -- revealing a .38 revolver. Oily, black, evil. He grabs a box of bullets. Spills them everywhere, all over the seats and floor. Clumsy. He picks bullets off his lap, loading them into the gun, one by one, methodical and grim. Six in the chamber. His gaze goes back to the bungalow. He shuts off the radio. Abrupt silence, except for the distant lovers' moans. He takes another shot of bourbon courage, then opens the door and steps from the car. 4        EXT -- PLYMOUTH -- NIGHT (1946) 4 His wingtip shoes crunch on gravel. Loose bullets scatter to the ground. The bourbon bottle drops and shatters. He starts up the path, unsteady on his feet. The closer he gets, the louder the lovemaking becomes. Louder and more frenzied. The lovers are reaching a climax, their sounds of passion degenerating into rhythmic gasps and grunts. WOMAN (O.S.) Oh god...oh god...oh god... Andy lurches to a stop, listening. The woman cries out in orgasm. The sound slams into Andy's brain like an icepick. He shuts his eyes tightly, wishing the sound would stop. It finally does, dying away like a siren until all that's left is the shallow gasping and panting of post-coitus. We hear languorous laughter, moans of satisfaction. WOMAN (O.S.) Oh god...that's sooo good...you're the best...the best I ever had... Andy just stands and listens, devastated. He doesn't look like much of a killer now; he's just a sad little man on a dirt path in the woods, tears streaming down his face, a loaded gun held loosely at his side. A pathetic figure, really.

Mr. Dufresne, describe the confrontation you had with your wife the night she was murdered. ANDY DUFRESNE is on the witness stand, hands folded, suit and tie pressed, hair meticulously combed. He speaks in soft, measured tones: ANDY It was very bitter. She said she was glad I knew, that she hated all the sneaking around. She said she wanted a divorce in Reno. D.A. What was your response? ANDY I told her I would not grant one. D.A. (refers to his notes) I'll see you in Hell before I see you in Reno. Those were the words you used, Mr. Dufresne, according to the testimony of your neighbors. ANDY If they say so. I really don't remember. I was upset. FADE TO BLACK: 2ND TITLE UP D.A. What happened after you and your wife argued? ANDY She packed a bag and went to stay with Mr. Quentin. D.A. Glenn Quentin. The golf pro at the Falmouth Hills Country Club. The man you had recently discovered was her lover. (Andy nods) Did you follow her? ANDY I went to a few bars first. Later, I decided to drive to Mr. Quentin's home and confront them. They weren't there...so I parked my car in the turnout...and waited. D.A. With what intention? ANDY I'm not sure. I was confused. Drunk. I think mostly I wanted to scare them. D.A. You had a gun with you? ANDY Yes. I did. FADE TO BLACK: 3RD TITLE UP D.A. When they arrived, you went up to the house and murdered them? ANDY No. I was sobering up. I realized she wasn't worth it. I decided to let her have her quickie divorce. D.A. Quickie divorce indeed. A .38 caliber divorce, wrapped in a handtowel to muffle the shots, isn't that what you mean? And then you shot her lover! ANDY I did not. I got back in the car and drove home to sleep it off. Along the way, I stopped and threw my gun into the Royal River. I feel I've been very clear on this point. D.A. Yes, you have. Where I get hazy, though, is the part where the cleaning woman shows up the next morning and finds your wife and her lover in bed, riddled with .38 caliber bullets. Does that strike you as a fantastic coincidence, Mr. Dufresne, or is it just me? ANDY (softly) Yes. It does. D.A. I'm sorry, Mr. Dufresne, I don't think the jury heard that. ANDY Yes. It does. D.A. Does what? ANDY Strike me as a fantastic coincidence. D.A. On that, sir, we are in accord... FADE TO BLACK! 4TH TITLE UP D.A. You claim you threw your gun into the Royal River before the murders took place. That's rather convenient. ANDY It's the truth. D.A. You recall Lt. Mincher's testimony? He and his men dragged that river for three days and nary a gun was found. So no comparison can be made between your gun and the bullets taken from the bloodstained corpses of the victims. That's also rather convenient, isn't it, Mr. Dufresne? ANDY (faint, bitter smile) Since I am innocent of this crime, sir, I find it decidedly inconvenient the gun was never found. FADE TO BLACK: STH TITLE UP 6        INT -- COURTROOM -- DAY (1946) 6 The D.A. holds the jury spellbound with his closing summation: D.A. Ladies and gentlemen, you've heard all the evidence, you know all the facts. We have the accused at the scene of the crime. We have foot prints. Tire tracks. Bullets scattered on the ground which bear his fingerprints. A broken bourbon bottle, likewise with fingerprints. Most of all, we have a beautiful young woman and her lover lying dead in each other's arms. They had sinned. But was their crime so great as to merit a death sentence? He gestures to Andy sitting quietly with his ATTORNEY. D.A. I suspect Mr. Dufresne's answer to that would be yes. I further suspect he carried out that sentence on the night of September 21st, this year of our Lord, 1946, by pumping four bullets into his wife and another four into Glenn Quentin. And while you think about that, think about this... He picks up a revolver, spins the cylinder before their eyes like a carnival barker spinning a wheel of fortune. D.A. A revolver holds six bullets, not eight. I submit to you this was not a hot-blooded crime of passion! That could at least be understood, if not condoned. No, this was revenge of a much more brutal and cold-blooded nature. Consider! Four bullets per victim! Not six shots fired, but eight! That means he fired the gun empty...and then stopped to reload so he could shoot each of them again! An extra bullet per lover...right in the head. (a few JURORS shiver) I'm done talking. You people are all decent, God-fearing Christian folk. You know what to do. FADE TO BLACK: 6TH TITLE UP 7        INT -- JURY ROOM -- DAY (1946) 7",

The new fish disembark, chained together single-file, blinking sourly at their surroundings. Andy stumbles against the MAN in front of him, almost drags him down. BYRON HADLEY, captain of the guard, slams his baton into Andy's back. Andy goes to his knees, gasping in pain. JEERS and SHOUTS from the spectators. HADLEY On your feet before I fuck you up so bad you never walk again. 13         ON THE BLEACHERS 13 RED There they are, boys. The Human Charm Bracelet. HEYWOOD Never seen such a sorry-lookin' heap of maggot shit in my life. JIGGER Comin' from you, Heywood, you being so pretty and all... FLOYD Takin' bets today, Red? RED (pulls notepad and pencil) Bear Catholic? Pope shit in the woods? Smokes or coin, bettor's choice. FLOYD Smokes. Put me down for two. RED High roller. Who's your horse? FLOYD That gangly sack of shit, third from the front. He'll be the first. HEYWOOD Bullshit. I'll take that action. ERNIE Me too. Other hands go up. Red jots the names. HEYWOOD You're out some smokes, son. Take my word. FLOYD You're so smart, you call it. HEYWOOD I say that chubby fat-ass...let's see...fifth from the front. Put me down for a quarter deck. RED That's five cigarettes on Fat-Ass. Any takers? More hands go up. Andy and the others are paraded along, forced by their chains to take tiny baby steps, flinching under the barrage of jeers and shouts. The old-timers are shaking the fence, trying to make the newcomers shit their pants. Some of the new fish shout back, but mostly they look terrified. Especially Andy. RED (V.O.) I must admit I didn't think much of Andy first time I laid eyes on him. He might'a been important on the outside, but in here he was just a little turd in prison grays. Looked like a stiff breeze could blow him over. That was my first impression of the man. SKEET What say, Red? RED Little fella on the end. Definitely. I stake half a pack. Any takers? SNOOZE Rich bet. RED C'mon, boys, who's gonna prove me wrong? (hands go up) Floyd, Skeet, Joe, Heywood. Four brave souls, ten smokes apiece. That's it, gentlemen, this window's closed. Red pockets his notepad. A VOICE comes over the P.A. speakers:",

YOU SLEEP WHEN WE SAY YOU SLEEP! YOU MAGGOT- DICK MOTHERFUCKER! Hadley rams the tip of his club into the con's belly. The man falls to his knees, gasping and clutching himself.

Within seconds, all stand naked. HADLEY First man into the shower! Hadley shoves the FIRST CON into a steel cage open at the front. TWO GUARDS open up with a fire hose. The con is slammed against the back of the cage, sputtering and hollering. Seconds later, the water is cut and the con yanked out. HADLEY Delouse that piece of shit! Next man in! The con gets a huge scoop of white delousing powder thrown all over him. Gasping and coughing, blinking powder from his eyes, he gets shoved to a trustee's cage.

Andy and the others are marched in, still naked, carrying their clothes and Bibles. The CONS in their cells greet them with TAUNTS, JEERS, and LAUGHTER. One by one, the new men are shown to their cells and locked in with a CLANG OF STEEL. RED (V.O.) The first night's the toughest, no doubt about it. They march you in naked as the day you're born, fresh from a Bible reading, skin burning and half-blind from that delousing shit they throw on you... Red watches from his cell, arms slung over the crossbars, cigarette dangling from his fingers. RED (V.O.) ...and when they put you in that cell, when those bars slam home, that's when you know it's for real. Old life blown away in the blink of an eye...a long cold season in hell stretching out ahead...nothing left but all the time in the world to think about it. Red listens to the CLANGING below. He watches Andy and a few others being brought up to the 2nd tier. RED (V.O.) Most new fish come close to madness the first night. Somebody always breaks down crying. Happens every time. The only question is, who's it gonna be? Andy is led past and given a cell at the end of the tier. RED (V.O.) It's as good a thing to bet on as any, I guess. I had my money on Andy Dufresne... 18        INT -- ANDY'S CELL -- NIGHT (1947) 18 The bars slam home. Andy is alone in his cell, clutching his clothes.

The moon hangs low and baleful in a dead sky. The headlight of a PASSING TRAIN cuts through the night. 20        INT -- RED'S CELL -- NIGHT (1947) 20 Red lies on his bunk below us, tossing his baseball toward the ceiling and catching it again.

Rooster laughs. Andy finds a table occupied by Red and his regulars, chooses a spot at the end where nobody is sitting. Ignoring their stares, he picks up his spoon -- and pauses, seeing something in his food. He carefully fishes it out with his fingers. It's a squirming maggot. Andy grimaces, unsure what to do with it. BROOKS HATLEN is sitting closest to Andy. At age 65, he's a senior citizen, a long-standing resident. BROOKS You gonna eat that? ANDY Hadn't planned on it. BROOKS You mind? Andy passes the maggot to Brooks. Brooks examines it, rolling it between his fingertips like a man checking out a fine cigar. Andy is riveted with apprehension. BROOKS Mmm. Nice and ripe. Andy can't bear to watch. Brooks opens up his sweater and feeds the maggot to a baby crow nestled in an inside pocket. Andy breathes a sigh of relief. BROOKS Jake says thanks.

The cart is squashed flat, shooting out from under Bogs and skidding across the cellblock floor like a tiddly wink, kicking up sparks for thirty yards. Ernie is left gaping in shock at Bogs and all the Bogs-related wreckage at his feet. 77         2ND TIER 77 Red is stunned. He very tentatively leans out and looks up. Above him, Hadley and Mert lean on the 3rd tier railing. Hadley tilts the cap back on his head, shakes his head. MERT Damn, Byron. Look'a that. HADLEY Poor fella must'a tripped. A tiny drop of blood drips off the toe of Hadley's shoe and splashes across Red's upturned cheek. He wipes it off, then looks down at Bogs. Cons and guards are racing to the scene. RED (V.O.) Two things never happened again after that. The Sisters never laid a finger on Andy again... 7B        EXT -- PRISON YARD/LOADING DOCK -- DAY (1949) 78 Bogs, wheelchair-bound and wearing a neck brace, is loaded onto an ambulance for transport. Behind the fence stand Red and his friends, watching. RED (V.O.) ...and Bogs never walked again. They transferred him to a minimum security hospital upstate. To my knowledge, he lived out the rest of his days drinking his food through a straw. RED I'm thinkin' Andy could use a nice welcome back when he gets out of the infirmary. HEYWOOD Sounds good to us. Figure we owe him for the beer. RED Man likes to play chess. Let's get him some rocks. 79        EXT -- FIELD -- DAY (1949) 79",

I'll even mail 'em for you, how's that? 94        INT -- ANDY'S CELL -- NIGHT (1949) 94 Andy is on his bunk, writing a letter. RED (V.O.)

Heavy wooden beams cross the ceiling. An arched window affords a view of Congress Street. Traffic noise drifts in. Brooks sets his bag down. He doesn't quite know what to do. He just stands there, like a man waiting for a bus. BROOKS (V.O.) The parole board got me into this halfway house called the Brewster, and a job bagging groceries at the Foodway... 114        INT -- FOODWAY MARKET -- DAY (1954) 114 Loud. Jangling with PEOPLE and NOISE. Brooks is bagging groceries. Registers are humming, kids are shrieking. WOMAN Make sure he double-bags. Last time your man didn't double-bag and the bottom near came out. MANAGER You double-bag like the lady says, understand? BROOKS Yes sir, double-bag, surely will. BROOKS (V.O.) It's hard work. I try to keep up, but my hands hurt most of the time. I don't think the store manager likes me very much. 115        EXT -- PARK -- DAY (1954) 115 Brooks sits alone on a bench, feeding pigeons. BROOKS (V.O.) Sometimes after work I go to the park and feed the birds. I keep thinking Jake might show up and say hello, but he never does.

Somewhere in the night, a LOUD ARGUMENT is taking place. BROOKS (V.O.) I have trouble sleeping at night. The bed is too big. I have bad dreams, like I'm falling. I wake up scared. Sometimes it takes me a while to remember where I am. 117        INT -- FOODWAY -- DAY (1954) 117",

Undershirts, socks, etc. BROOKS (V.O.) But I guess I'm too old for that sort of nonsense anymore. 119        INT -- BROOKS' ROOM -- SHORTLY LATER (1954) 119 Brooks is dressed in his suit. He finishes knotting his tie, puts his hat on his head. The letter lies on the desk, stampe3 and ready for mailing. His bag is by the door. BROOKS (V.O.) I don't like it here. I'm tired of being afraid all the time. I've decided not to stay. He takes one last look around. Only one thing left to do. He steps to a wooden chair in the center of the room, pulls out s pocketknife, and glances up at the ceiling beam. He steps up onto the chair. It wobbles queasily. Now facing the beam, he carves a message into the wood: \"Brooks Hatlen was here.\" He smiles with a sort of inner peace. BROOKS (V.O.) I doubt they'll kick up any fuss. Not for an old crook like me. 120         TIGHT ON CHAIR 120 His weight shifts on the wobbly chair -- and it goes out from under him. His feet remain where they are, kicking feebly in mid-air. His hat falls to the floor. ANGLE WIDENS. Brooks has hanged himself. He swings gently, facing the open window. Traffic noise floats up from below. 121        EXT -- EXERCISE YARD -- SHAWSHANK -- DAY (1954) 121 Andy reads the letter to Red and the others: ANDY P.S. Tell Heywood I'm sorry I put a knife to his throat. No hard feelings. A long silence. Andy folds the letter, puts it away. Softly: RED He should'a died in here, goddamn it. 122        INT -- PRISON LIBRARY -- DAY (1954) 122 Andy is sorting books on the cart. He replaces a stack on the shelf -- and pauses, noticing a line of ants crawling up the wood. He glances up. The ants disappear over the top. He pulls a chair over and stands on it, peers cautiously over. ANDY Red! Red steps in with an armload of files. Andy gingerly reaches in, grabs a black feathered wing, and pulls out a dead crow.",

A HUNDRED CONS are at work in the fields. GUARDS patrol with carbines, keeping a sharp eye. We find Andy, Red, and the boys working with picks and shovels. They glance over to the pickup truck. Hadley's chewing the fat with Mert and Youngblood. A WHISTLE BLOWS. GUARD Water break! Five minutes! The work stops. Cons head for the pickup truck, where water is dispensed with dipper and pail. Red and the boys look to Andy. Andy nods. Now's the time. The group moves off through the confusion, using it as cover. They head up the slope of a nearby hill and quickly decide on a suitable spot. The guards haven't noticed. Jigger and Floyd start swinging picks into the soft earth, quickly ripping out a hole. Red reaches into his jacket and pulls out a beautiful wooden box, carefully stained and varnished. He shows it around to nods of approval. ANDY That's real pretty, Red. Nice work. HEYWOOD Shovel man in. Watch the dirt. 124         CONTINUED 124 Heywood jumps in and starts spading out the hole. 125         BY THE TRUCK 125 Youngblood glances up and sees the men on the slope.

YOU GOT FIVE SECONDS 'FORE I SHOOT SOMEBODY! Suddenly, other cons start breaking away in groups, dozens of them heading toward the slope. The guards look around. HADLEY What am I, talkin' to myself? 126         ON THE SLOPE 126 Andy pulls a towel-wrapped bundle from his jacket and unfolds it. Jake. Andy lays him in the box, followed by Brook's letter. Red places the casket in the hole. A moment of silence. Andy gives Red with an encouraging nod. RED Lord. Brooks was a sinner. Jake was just a crow. Neither was much to look at. Both got institutionalized. See what you can do for 'em. Amen. Muttered \"amens\" all around.

His eyes mist with emotion at the sight. HADLEY I want all this cleared out before the warden gets back, I shit you not. Hadley exits. Andy touches the boxes like a love-struck man touching a beautiful woman. Wiley grins. WILEY Good for you, Andy. ANDY Only took six years. (beat) From now on, I send two letters a week instead of one. WILEY (laughs, shakes his head) I believe you're crazy enough. You better get this stuff downstairs like the Captain said. I'm gonna go pinch a loaf. When I get back, this is all gone, right? Andy nods. Wiley disappears into the toilet, Jughead Comix in hand. Alone now, Andy starts going through the boxes like a starving man exploring packages of food. He doesn't know where to turn first. He gets giddy, ripping boxes open and pulling out books, touching them, smelling them. He rips open another box. This one contains an old phonograph player, industrial gray and green, the words \"Portland Public School District\" stenciled on the side. The box also contains stacks and stacks of used record albums. Andy reverently slips a stack from the box and starts flipping through them. Used Nat King Coles, Bing Crosbys, etc. He comes across a certain album -- Mozart's \"Le Nozze de Figaro.\" He pulls it from the stack, gazing upon it as a man transfixed. It is a thing of beauty. It is the Grail. 130        INT -- BATHROOM -- DAY (1955) 130 Wiley sits in one of the stalls, Jughead comic on his knees. 131        INT -- GUARD STATION/OUTER OFFICE -- DAY (1955) 131 Andy wrestles the phonograph player onto the guards' desk, sweeping things onto the floor in his haste. He plugs the machine in. A red light warms up. The platter starts spinning. He slides the Mozart album from its sleeve, lays it on the platter, and lowers the tone arm to his favorite cut. The needle HISSES in the groove...and the MUSIC begins, lilting and gorgeous. Andy sinks into Wiley's chair, overcome by its beauty. It is \"Deutino: Che soave zeffiretto,\" a duet sung by Susanna and the Contessa. 132        INT -- BATHROOM -- DAY (1955) 132 Wiley pauses reading, puzzled. He thinks he hears music. WILEY Andy? You hear that? 133        INT -- GUARD STATION/OUTER OFFICE -- DAY (1955) 133 Andy shoots a look at the bathroom...and smiles. Go for broke. He lunges to his feet and barricades the front door, then the bathroom. He returns to the desk and positions the P.A. microphone. He works up his courage, then flicks all the toggles to \"on.\" A SQUEAL OF FEEDBACK echoes briefly... 134 INT/EXT -- VARIOUS P.A. SPEAKERS -- DAY (1955) 134 ...and the Mozart is suddenly broadcast all over the prison. 135        INT -- BATHROOM -- DAY (1955) 135 Wiley lunges to his feet, pants tangling around his ankles. 136 INT/EXT -- SHAWSHANK PRISON -- VARIOUS LOCATIONS -- DAY (1955) 136 Cons all over the prison stop whatever they're doing, freezing in mid-step to listen, gazing up at the speakers. 137         THE STAMPING MACHINES IN THE PLATE SHOP ARE SHUT DOWN... 137 138         THE LAUNDRY LINE GOES SILENT, GRINDING TO A HALT... 138 139         THE WOOD SHOP MACHINES ARE TURNED OFF, BUZZING TO A STOP... 139 140         THE MOTOR POOL...THE KITCHEN...THE LOADING DOCK...THE EXERCISE 140 thru yard...the numbing routine of prison life itself...all grinds thru 143",

We need it so we don't forget. RED Forget? ANDY That there are things in this world not carved out of gray stone. That there's a small place inside of us they can never lock away, and that place is called hope. RED Hope is a dangerous thing. Drive a man insane. It's got no place here.

Behind them are GUARDS overseeing the work. Andy yanks his kerchief down, grinning in exhilaration. Red and the others follow suit. They step through the hole in the wall, exploring what used to be a sealed-off storage room. RED (V.O.)

ANDY What you hear isn't half of it. He's got scams you haven't dreamed of. Kickbacks on his kickbacks. There's a river of dirty money flowing through this place. RED Money like that can be a problem. Sooner or later you gotta explain where it came from. ANDY That's where I come in. I channel it, funnel it, filter it...stocks, securities, tax free municipals... I send that money out into the big world. And when it comes back... RED It's clean as a virgin's whistle? ANDY Cleaner. By the time Norton retires, I will have made him a millionaire. RED Jesus. They ever catch on, he's gonna wind up wearing a number himself. ANDY (smiles) I thought you had more faith in me than that. RED I'm sure you're good, but all that paper leaves a trail. Anybody gets too curious -- FBI, IRS, whatever -- that trail's gonna lead to somebody. ANDY Sure it will. But not to me, and certainly not to the warden. RED Who then? ANDY Peter Stevens. RED Who? ANDY The silent, silent partner. He's the guilty one, your Honor. The man with the bank accounts. That's where the filtering process starts. They trace it back, all they're gonna find is him. RED Yeah, okay, but who the hell is he?",

Mr. Stevens has a birth certificate, social security card, driver's license. They ever track those accounts, they'll wind up chasing a figment of my imagination. RED Jesus. Did I say you were good?

I had to come to prison to be a crook. 168        EXT -- PRISON YARD -- DUSK (1965) RED Does it ever bother you? ANDY I don't run the scams, Red, I just process the profits. That's a fine line, maybe. But I've also built that library, and used it to help a dozen guys get their high school diplomas. Why do you think the warden lets me do all that? RED To keep you happy and doing the laundry. Money instead of sheets. ANDY I work cheap. That's the trade-off. TWO SIREN BLASTS draw their attention to the main gate.

TOMMY I feel bad. I let him down. RED That's crap, son. He's proud of you. Proud as a hen. (off Tommy's look) We been friends a long time. I know him as good as anybody. TOMMY Smart fella, ain't he? RED Smart as they come. Used to be a banker on the outside. TOMMY What's he in for anyway? RED Murder. TOMMY The hell you say. RED You wouldn't think, lookin' at him. Caught his wife in bed with some golf pro. Greased 'em both. C'mon, boy, back to work... SMASH! Red turns back. Tommy's Coke has slipped from his hand and shattered on the floor.

Dumbfuck thing to do. (beat) Few months left to go, I get a new cellmate in. Elmo Blatch. Big twitchy fucker. Crazy eyes. Kind of roomie you pray you don't get, know what I'm sayin'? 6 to 12 for armed burglary. Said he done hundreds of jobs. Hard to believe, high-strung as he was. Cut a loud fart, he'd go three feet in the air. Talked all the time, too, that's the other thing. Never shut up. Places he'd been, jobs he pulled, women he fucked. Even people he killed. People that gave him shit, that's how he put it. One night, like a joke, I say: \"Yeah? Who'd you kill?\" So he says... BLATCH ...I got me this job one time bussin' tables at a country club. So I could case all the big rich pricks that come in. I pick out this guy, go in one night and do his place. He wakes up and gives me shit. So I killed him. Him and the tasty bitch he was with. (starts laughing) That's the best part! She's fuckin' this prick, see, this golf pro, but she's married to some other guy! Some hotshot banker. He's the one they pinned it on! They got him down-Maine somewhere doin' time for the crime! Ain't that choice? He throws his head back and ROARS with laughter. 191        INT -- PRISON LIBRARY -- DAY (1966) 191 Silence. Tommy has finished his story. Red is stunned...but Andy looks like he's been smacked with a two by four. RED Andy? Andy says nothing. Walks stiffly away.

I mean for real innocent? (Red nods) Sweet Jesus. How long's he been in here? RED Since '47. Going on nineteen years. MAIL CALLER Thomas Williams! Tommy raises his hand. The envelope gets tossed to him. He stares at it. Red peers over his shoulder. RED Board of Education. TOMMY The son of a bitch mailed it. RED Looks that way. You gonna open it or stick your thumb up your butt? TOMMY Thumb up my butt sounds better. He gets hemmed in by the older men. Red snatches the letter. TOMMY C'mon, just throw it away.

Like a closed book. Complained about it all the time. (pause) She was beautiful. I loved her. But I guess I couldn't show it enough. (softly) I killed her, Red. Andy finally glances to Red, seeking a reaction. Silence. ANDY I didn't pull the trigger. But I drove her away. That's why she died. Because of me, the way I am. RED That don't make you a murderer. Bad husband, maybe. Andy smiles faintly in spite of himself. Red gives his shoulder a squeeze. RED Feel bad about it if you want. But you didn't pull the trigger. ANDY No. I didn't. Someone else did, and I wound up here. Bad luck, I guess. RED Bad luck? Jesus. ANDY It floats around. Has to land on somebody. Say a storm comes through. Some folks sit in their living rooms and enjoy the rain. The house next door gets torn out of the ground and smashed flat. It was my turn, that's all. I was in the path of the tornado. (softly) I just had no idea the storm would go on as long as it has. (glances to him) Think you'll ever get out of here? RED Sure.

We made love under that tree. I asked and she said yes. (beat) Promise me, Red. If you ever get out, find that spot.

RED (V.O.) They got this skinny kid named Rory Tremont to go in the hole. He wasn't much in the brains department, but he possessed the one most important qualification for the job... (they slap a flashlight in his hands) ...he was willing to go. 223        INT -- TUNNEL -- DAY (1966) 223 Rory squeezes down the tunnel on his belly. RED (V.O.) Probably thought he'd win a Bronze Star or something. 224        INT -- VERTICAL SHAFT -- DAY (1966) 224 Dark as midnight. Concrete walls rise on both sides. If you imagine them as two huge slices of bread, the meat of this particular sandwich is about three feet of airspace and a dark tangle of pipes between the cellblocks. Rory's appears, shining his flashlight down the shaft. Somewhere, a rat SQUEAKS. RED (V.O.) It was his third day on the job. RORY Warden? There's a space here between the walls 'bout three feet across! Smells pretty damn bad! NORTON (O.S.) I don't care what it smells like! HADLEY (O.S.) Go on, boy! We got a hold of you! Looking none too happy about it, Rory squeezes from the tunnel and dangles into the shaft. He gets lowered, shining his light, smothered by darkness. Not having a good time. RORY Hoo-whee! Smell's gettin' worse! NORTON (O.S.) Never mind, I said! Just keep going! RORY Smells pretty damn bad, Warden! In fact, it smells just like shit. His feet touch the ground -- or what he assumed was the ground. It's not. In fact, it's just what it smells like. He sinks in past his ankles. He slips and sits heavily in it. RORY Oh God, that's what it is, it's shit. oh my God it's shit. pull me out 'fore I blow my groceries, oh shit it's shit, oh my Gawwwwwwd! 225        INT -- ANDY'S CELL -- DAY (1966) 225 Red and others listen to violent barfing from below. RED (V.O.) And then came the unmistakable sound of Rory Tremont losing his last few meals. The whole cellblock heard it. I mean, it echoed. That's it for Red. He starts laughing. Laughing, hell, he's bellowing laughter, laughing so hard he has to hold himself, laughing so hard tears are pouring down his cheeks. The look of rage on Norton's face makes him laugh all the harder. 226        INT -- SOLITARY WING -- NIGHT (1966) 226 Abrupt silence. LOW ANGLE on steel door. RED (V.O.) I laughed myself right into solitary. Two week stretch. 227        INT -- SOLITARY -- NIGHT (1966) 227",

Now I knew what he meant. 228        EXT -- SHAWSHANK PRISON -- WIDE SHOT -- DAY (1966) 228 Virgin landscape. Charming rural road. Suddenly, State Police cruisers rocket up the road with SIRENS AND LIGHTS. RED (V.O.) In 1966, Andy Dufresne escaped from Shawshank Prison. 229        EXT -- FIELD -- DAY (1966) 229 Shawshank is half a mile distant. WE TRACK ALONG a muddy creel as STATE TROOPERS and PRISON GUARDS scour the brush. A TROOPEE fishes a prison uniform out of the creek with a long stick. RED (V.O.) All they found of him was a muddy set of prison clothes, a bar of soap, and an old rock-hammer damn near worn down to the nub. TROOPER g2 pulls the rock-hammer from the weeds. SWISH PAN to a POLICE PHOTOGRAPHER. His FLASHBULB GLARE produces: 230         A BLACK AND WHITE STILL PHOTO 230 of the hapless cops posing with Andy's reeking uniform and the worn rock-hammer. PUSH IN on the hammer. RED (V.O.) I remember thinking it would take a man six hundred years to tunnel through the wall with it. Andy did it in less than twenty. 231        INT -- ANDY'S CELL -- NIGHT (1949) 231 Once again, we see Andy using the rock-hammer to scratch his name into the cement. Suddenly, a palm-sized chunk of cement pops free and hits the floor. He stares down at it. 232        INT -- ANDY'S CELL -- NIGHT (1949) 232 Andy lies in the dark, studying the chunk of concrete in his hands. Considering the possibilities. Wrestling with hope. RED (V.O.) Andy loved geology. I imagine it appealed to his meticulous nature. An ice age here, a million years of mountain-building there, plates of bedrock grinding against each other over a span of millennia... 233        INT -- ANDY'S CELL -- NIGHT (1949) 233 Andy stands peering at the small hole left by the fallen chunk. Carefully runs his fingertip over it. RED (V.O.) Geology is the study of pressure and time. That's all it takes, really. Pressure and time. 234        INT -- ANDY'S CELL -- NIGHT (1951) 234 Rita is now on the wall, hanging down over Andy's back. RED (V.O.) That and a big damn poster. TRACK IN to reveal Andy scraping patiently at the concrete. RED (V.O.) Like I said. In prison, a man'll do most anything to keep his mind occupied. He hears FOOTSTEPS approaching. He smoothes the poster down and dives into bed. A GUARD strolls by a moment later, shining his flashlight into the cell. 235        EXT -- PRISON YARD -- DAY (1953) 235 Andy strolls along, whistling softly, hands in both pockets. TILT DOWN to his pantleg. Concrete grit trickles out. RED (V.O.) It turns out Andy's favorite hobby was totin' his wall out into the exercise yard a handful at a time... 236        INT -- 2ND TIER -- NIGHT (1962) 236",

                    "raw_text": "LOOKING STRAIGHT DOWN. Below us, Tommy Williams lies facedown at Norton's feet. Blood is spreading, fanning out oa the pavement. Norton turns, strolls out of frame. RED (V.O.) I guess after Tommy was killed, Andy decided he'd been here just about long enough. Again we see: Andy working. Norton pokes his head in. NORTON Lickety-split. I wanna get home. ANDY Just about done, sir. Norton crosses to the wall safe and works the dial, his back turned. This time, though, we stay on Andy: He pulls up his sweater, yanks out a large black book and a stack of files, lays them on the desk. He then grabs the real ledger and files, jams them down his pants and smoothes his sweater down. He picks up the bogus stack, crosses to Norton, and shoves everything in. 243        INT -- HALLWAY -- NIGHT (1966) 243 Norton exits his office and strolls off whistling. PUSH IN on the open door. We see Andy at the guard's desk, pulling Norton's dress shoes from their box. RED (V.O.) Andy did like he was told. Buffed those shoes to a high mirror shine. 244        INT -- NORTON'S OFFICE -- MINUTES LATER (1966) 244 Andy sorts through Norton's three suits. He pauses, checking the gray pinstripe. Nice. 245        INT -- CELLBLOCK FIVE -- NIGHT (1966) 245 The guard BUZZES Andy through. Andy walks toward us. RED (V.O.) The guard simply didn't notice. Neither did I. I mean, seriously, how often do you really look at a man's shoes? TILT DOWN as he passes by. Yep, he's wearing Norton's shoes. 246        INT -- ANDY'S CELL -- NIGHT (1966) 246 The lights go out. Andy places the last chess piece. Gazes up at Racquel. Smiles. Pulls the rope from under his pillow. He stands and unbuttons his prison shirt, revealing Norton's gray pinstripe suit underneath. A FLASH OF LIGHTNING floods the cell, throwing wild shadows. 247        INT -- ANDY'S CELL -- NIGHT (1966) 247 The storm rages. Andy, naked, carefully slips Norton's folded suit into a large industrial Zip-Lock bag. Next to go in are the shoes, chess pieces (already in a smaller bag), black ledger en files. Last but not least, a bar of soap wrapped in a towel. 248        INT -- TUNNEL -- NIGHT (1966) 248 Andy, again wearing prison clothes, inches down the tunnel. 249        INT -- SHAFT -- NIGHT (1966) 249 Andy squeezes through the hole head-first, emerges to the waist, He reaches for the opposite wall, manages to snag a steel conduit with his fingers. Suddenly, a huge rat darts for his hand. Andy yanks away and almost plummets head-first down the shaft. He dangles wildly upside-down for a moment, arms windmilling, then gets his hands pressed firmly against the opposite wall. The rat scurries off, pissed. Andy snags the conduit again. He contorts out of the hole and dangles into the shaft. We now see the purpose for the rope: the plastic bag hangs from his ankle with about two feet of slack, He kicks his legs across the shaft, gets his feet braced. Wit3 his back against one wall and feet against the other, he starts down the shaft. Sliding dangerously. Using pipes for handholds. Flinching as rats dart this way and that, scurrying in the shadows. He drops the last few feet to the bottom. He approaches the ceramic sewer pipe and kneels before it. Pulls out the rock-hammer and says a quick silent prayer. Raises the rock-hammer high and swings it down with all his might. Once, twice -- third time lucky. An enormous eruption of sewage cascades into the air as if rocket-propelled, the Mount St. Helens of shit. Andy is instantly coated black. He turns away and heaves his guts out. The shit keeps coming. 250        INT -- SEWER PIPE -- NIGHT (1966) 250 Andy peers down through the hole, playing his penlight aroun5, The inside diameter is no more than two feet. Tight squeeze. Coated with crud. It seems to go on for miles. No turning back. He wriggles into the pipe and starts crawling, plastic bag dragging behind. RED (V.O.) Andy crawled to freedom through five hundred yards of shit-smelling foulness I can't even imagine. Or maybe I just don't want to. 251        EXT -- FIELD -- NIGHT (1966) 251 Rain is falling in solid sheets. Shawshank is half a mile distant. BOOM DOWN to reveal the creek...and PUSH IN toward the mouth of the sewer pipe that feeds into it. RED (V.O.) Five hundred yards. The length of five football fields. Just shy of half a mile. Fingers appear, thrusting through the heavy-gauge wire mesh covering the mouth of the pipe. Andy's face looms from the darkness, peering out at freedom. He wrenches the mesh loose, pushes himself out, and plunges head-first into the creek. He comes up sputtering for breath. The water is waist-deep. He wades upstream, ripping his clothes from his body. He gets his shirt off, spins it through the air over his head, flings the shirt away. He raises his arms to the sky, turning slowly, feeling the rain washing him clean. Exultant. Triumphant. A FLASH OF LIGHTNING arcs from horizon to horizon. 252        INT -- ANDY'S TUNNEL -- DAY (1966) 252 Once again, we see stunned faces as CAMERA PULLS BACK. RED (V.O.) The next morning, right about the time Racquel was spilling her little secret... 253        INT -- CASCO BANK OF PORTLAND -- MORNING (1966) 253 The door opens. Spit-shined shoes enter. DOLLY the shoes to the counter. RED (V.O.) ...a man nobody ever laid eyes on before strolled into the Casco Bank of Portland. Until that moment, he didn't exist -- except on paper. FEMALE TELLER (O.S.) May I help you? TILT UP to Andy. Smiling in Norton's gray pinstripe suit.",

RED (V.O.) He had all the proper I.D. Driver's license, birth certificate, social security card. The signature was a spot-on match. MANAGER I must say I'm sorry to be losing your business. I hope you'll enjoy living abroad. ANDY Thank you. I'm sure I will. TELLER Here's your cashier's check, sir. Will there be anything else? ANDY Please. Would you add this to your outgoing mail? He hands her a package, stamped and addressed. Gives them a pleasant smile. Turns and strolls from the bank. RED (V.O.) Mr. Stevens visited nearly a dozen banks in the Portland area that morning. All told, he blew town with better than 370 thousand dollars of Warden Norton's money. Severance pay for nineteen years. 255        INT -- OFFICE -- DAY (1966) 255",

His face scrunches up. He begins to cry. RED (V.O.) I wasn't there to see it, but I hear Byron Hadley was sobbing like a little girl when they took him away. Hadley sobs all the way to the car. The D.A. snaps a gaze up toward Norton's window, motions his men to follow. 260        INT -- NORTON'S OFFICE -- DAY (1966) 260 Norton is staring out the window as they approach the building. He goes to his desk, opens a drawer. Inside lies a revolver and a box of shells. RED (V.O.)

He starts sorting them to see which ones he likes. 263         OUTSIDE HIS OFFICE 263 Troopers hustle the hapless duty guard to Norton's door as he fumbles nervously with a huge key ring. DUTY GUARD I'm not sure which one it is... He starts trying keys in the lock. And as the keys go sliding in one after another... 264        INT -- NORTON'S OFFICE -- DAY (1966) 264 ...so do the bullets. Norton is riveted to the door. For every key, he loads another bullet. Methodical and grim. He gets the final bullet in just as the right key slams home. The door bursts open. Men muscle in. Somebody SHOUTS. Troopers dive in all directions as Norton raises the gun -- -- and jams it under his chin. his head snaps back as the wall goes red. His swivel chair does a slow half-turn and creaks to a final stop. Troopers rise slowly, gazing in horror. RED (V.O.) I like to think the last thing that went through his head...other than that bullet...was to wonder how the hell Andy Dufresne ever got the best of him. PUSH SLOWLY to the wall to reveal Mrs. Norton's framed sampler trickling blood and brains...and we get our final Bible lesson for today: \"HIS JUDGMENT COMETH AND THAT RIGHT SOON.\" 265        EXT -- PRISON YARD -- DAY (1966) 265 Mail call. Red hears his name. They pass him a postcard. RED (V.O.) Not long after the warden deprived us of his company, I got a postcard in the mail. It was blank. But the postmark said, \"McNary, Texas.\" 266        INT -- LIBRARY -- DAY (1966) 266 Red sits with an atlas, tracing his finger down the page. RED (V.O.) McNary. Right on the border. That's where Andy crossed.

Andy Dufresne, headed for the Pacific. 268        INT -- MESS HALL -- DAY (1966) 268 Heywood is regaling the table with some anecdote about Andy. RED (V.O.)

He senses a presence, looks over his shoulder. There's a Rita Hayworth poster on his wall. He gets out of bed. Rita just keeps smiling, inscrutable. As Red watches, a brilliant round glow builds behind the poster, shining from the tunnel. The poster rips free, charred to ash in the blink of an eye as a shaft of holy white light stabs into the cell. Sunlight. Red staggers back against the glare. A whirlwind kicks up, whipping everything into the air. The hole in the wall is like a giant vacuum cleaner -- papers, book, toiletries, bedding -- if it ain't nailed down, it gets sucked down the hole toward the light. Red fights it, but the suction drags him closer and closer... 271         RED'S POV 271 ...and CAMERA rockets into the hole, getting sucked down an endless tunnel at impossible speed, the ROAR of air mixing with his drawn-out SCREAM, closer and closer to the light... ...and erupting out the other side into total silence and a beautiful white beach. The Pacific Ocean before us. Enormous. Mind-blowing. Beautiful beyond description. All we hear now are the gentle sound of waves. RED (V.O.) ...dreams where I am lost in a warm place with no memory. A lone figure stands at water's edge. CAMERA KEEPS MOVING, coming up behind him and TRACKING AROUND to reveal -- Red. RED (V.O.) An ocean so big it strikes me dumb. Waves so quiet they strike me deaf. Sunshine so bright it strikes me blind. It is a place that is blue beyond reason. Bluer than can possibly exist. Bluer than my mind can possibly grasp. 272         AERIAL SHOT 272 Nothing for a million miles but beach, sky, and water. Red is a tiny speck at water's edge. Just another grain of sand. RED (V.O.)

RED (V.O.) Andy. I know you're in that place. Look at the stars for me just after sunset. Touch the sand...wade in the water...and feel free. FADE TO BLACK 274         AN IRON-BARRED DOOR 274 slides open with an enormous CLANG. A stark room beyond. CAMERA PUSHES through. SIX MEN AND ONE WOMAN sit at a long table. An empty chair faces them.

The parole board exchanges glances. Somebody clears his throat. MAN #1 Shall I repeat the question? RED I heard you. Rehabilitated. Let's see now. You know, come to think of it, I have no idea what that means. MAN #2 Well, it means you're ready to rejoin society as a-- RED I know what you think it means. Me, I think it's a made-up word, a poli- tician's word. A word so young fellas like you can wear a suit and tie and have a job. What do you really want to know? Am I sorry for what I did? - ----- MAN g2 Well...are you? RED Not a day goes by I don't feel regret, and not because I'm in here or because you think I should. I look back on myself the way I was...stupid kid who did that terrible crime...wish I could talk sense to him. Tell him how things are. But I can't. That kid's long gone, this old man is all that's left, and I have to live with that. (beat) Rehabilitated? That's a bullshit word, so you just go on ahead and stamp that form there, sonny, and stop wasting my damn time. Truth is, I don't give a shit. The parole board just stares. Red sits drumming his fingers. CLOSEUP -- PAROLE FORM A big rubber stamp SLAMS down -- and lifts away to reveal the word \"APPROVED\" in red ink. 275        EXT -- SHAWSHANK PRISON -- DAY 275 TWO SHORT SIREN BLASTS herald the opening of the main gate. It swings hugely open, revealing Red standing in his cheap suit, carrying a cheap bag, wearing a cheap hat. He walks out, still looking stunned. 276        INT -- BUS -- DAY 276 Red rides the bus, clutching the seat before him, gripped by terror of speed and motion. 277        EXT -- BREWSTER HOTEL -- LATE AFTERNOON 277 Red arrives at the Brewster, three stories high and even less to look at than it used to be. 27B        INT -- BREWSTER -- LATE DAY 278 A BLACK WOMAN leads Red up the stairs toward the top floor. 279        INT -- RED'S ROOM -- LATE DAY 279 Small, old, dingy. An arched window with a view of Congress Street. Traffic noise floats up. Red enters and pauses, staring up at the ceiling beam. Carved into the wood are the words: \"Brooks Hatlen was here.\" 280        INT -- FOODWAY MARKET -- DAY 280 Loud. Jangling with PEOPLE and NOISE. We find Red bagging groceries. Registers are humming, kids are shrieking. Red calls to the STORE MANAGER: RED Sir? Restroom break sir? MANAGER (motions him over) You don't need to ask me every time you go take a piss. Just go.
