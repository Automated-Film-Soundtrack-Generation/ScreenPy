I always believe that you have to fight from the inside not from without. I asked myself, what's the duty of an artist, to stay or to leave? And then Goebbels demanded that I acknowledge Hitler as solely responsible for cultural policy. Well, that was a fact and it seemed pointless to deny it. I simply acknowledged that Hitler and the Minister of Culture appointed by him were solely responsible for the cultural policy of the Reich. What I wanted to express was that I, personally, had no responsibility whatsoever for their cultural policy.

At the rear of the church, Emmi and David, enraptured, seated side by side. The first movement ends and the Adagio begins. After the music gathers momentum: Rain. Thunder and lightning. The musicians continue to play, unperturbed.  They are coming to the end of the Quintet. David and Emmi huddled together. Some umbrellas up and then movement which catches David's attention. He nudges Emmi, I indicates with his chin. People have moved to reveal Furtwangler: seated, wearing a hat, still I' as a statue, soaked, listening, expressionless. Much applause. The musicians bow. The audience start to leave. Emmi and David emerge from the ruins.  Furtwangler passes them. They nod awkwardly. He doesn't respond but is about to walk on when Dymshitz pushes through, nods to David, who salutes. Dymshitz catches up with Furtwangler. They are near to Emmi and David.",
