TRUCK STOP DINER - NIGHT On a back route to north L.A.  A handful of local TRUCKERS hunch over chili-sizes, CAT hats pushed back on their heads.  Three BIKERS are playing a game of pool in the back, their Miller empties lining the table's rail.  The dive's owner, LLOYD, a fat, aging biker-type in a soiled apron, stands behind the bar.  Nothing much going on... Then the front door opens and a big naked guy strolls in -- that doesn't happen every night.  All eyes simultaneously swivel toward Terminator.  Its emotionless gaze passes over the customers as it walks calmly through the room.  Everyone frozen, not sure how to react. 8A      TERMINATOR POV.  A digitized electronic scan of the room, overlaid with alphanumeric readouts which change faster than the human eye can follow.  In POV we move past the staring truckers, past the owner and the awestruck WAITRESS, and approach a large nasty-looking biker puffing on a cigar.  His body is outlined, or \"selected\", and thousands of estimated measurements appear.  His clothing has been analyzed and deemed suitable... 8B",

Terminator calmly, and without expression, grabs Cigar by his meaty upper arm... Cigar screams from the hydraulic grip. Terminator doesn't see Cigar's friend, behind him, holding his pool cue by the narrow end like a Louisville Slugger.  The heavy send whistles in a powerful swing and CRACKS IN TWO across the back of Terminator's head. Terminator seems not to notice.  Doesn't even blink.  Without releasing his grip on Cigar, he snaps his arm straight back and grabs Pool Cue by the front of his jacket.  Suddenly the heavyset biker finds himself flying through the nearest window.  CRAASSH! Terminator hurls Cigar, all 230 pounds of him, clear over the bar, through the serving window into the kitchen, where he lands on the big flat GRILL.  We hear a SOUND like SIZZLING BACON as Cigar screams, flopping jerking.  He rolls off in a smoking heap. The third biker whips out a knife with a eight-inch blade and slashes at Terminator's face. Terminator grabs the arcing blade with his bare hand.  Holding it by the razor-sharp blade he jerks is from the guy's hand. Ultra-fast here: He flips it.  Grabs the handle like you're supposed to hold a knife.  Grabs the biker and slams him face-down over the bar.  Then brings the knife whistling down, pinning the biker's shoulder to the bar top with his own steel. 9       INT. KITCHEN The doors BANGS OPEN and Terminator strides in. The Mexican cook does a fast fade as Terminator walks toward Cigar, who is cursing in pain on the floor. With his deep-fried fingers he struggles to get out the .45 auto tucked under his leather jacket.  But he can't even hold onto it. Terminator takes it from him.  Instead of pointing it at him, Terminator carefully examines weapon, analyzing its caliber and operating condition.  Terminator never threatens... that's a human thing.  He just takes. Cigar senses what he must do when the emotionless eyes come back to him.  He slides the keys to his bike across the floor to Terminator's foot.  Then painfully starts getting out of his jacket. 10      INT. TRUCK STOP Terminator strides from the kitchen, fully clothed now in a black leather jacket, leather riding pants, and heavy, clean boots.  He moves toward the moaning biker pinned to the pool table.  Without slowing his stride he jerks the knife out.  The guy slumps to the floor, groaning, behind him. Terminator continues toward the front of the diner, passing Lloyd, the owner.  At the door, he comes abreast of two truckers who sit frozen like a snapshot in mid-bite.  One of the truckers finally nods.",

Lloyd starts sweating, trying to decide is he's going to kill a man in cold blood.  He's still trying to decide when Terminator's hand blurs out like a striking cobra and is somehow suddenly holding the shotgun. Lloyd gapes, knowing he's screwed.  Then... Terminator reaches toward him.  Oh shit... And slips the sunglasses out of Lloyd's shirt pocket.  Puts them on. Strides back to the Harley and roars off in a shower of gravel. 12      EXT.

He holds the pack between his knees and pulls out a little lap-top keyboard, which is also connected to the black-box. John enters a few commands and the plasma-screen displays the PIN number for that account.  He quickly enters the number on the Ready- Teller's keypad and asks it for 300 bucks.  The machine whirs then begins dispensing twenty-dollar bills.  Tim looks back over his shoulder amazed.",

It grips her hand, Virgil to her Dante in this tour of the nuclear-age Inferno. 30D     THE BLAST WAVE HITS... a near-solid wall of compressed air followed by 250-mph winds.  The children, charcoal statues frozen in positions of play, explode into black leaves of ash and swirl away.  SOUND hit now, with a thunderous roar.

Beside her, Terminator is stripped of its burnt flesh, becoming a smoking skeleton of steel. 30E     Then she wake up... in her cell, shackled to the bed.  Sunlight hurts her eyes.  She looks desperate and defeated.  She knows the war is coming.  It visits her every time she closes her eyes.  Lost and alone, Sarah feels all hope recede for herself and for humanity.",

Dyson and a GUARD stand together before what looks like a high-tech bank vault.  It requires two keys to open, like the launch controls in a nuclear silo.  The guard and Dyson insert their keys and turn them simultaneously.  Dyson then enters a passcode at a console and the vault unlocks itself with a sequence of clunks.  The door swings open and Dyson enters.  Bryant stays outside with the guard, who notes Dyson's name and item on a clipboard. 37      INT. VAULT Dyson walks to a stainless steel cabinet and opens it.  Inside is a small artifact in a sealed container of inert gas.  IT -- a ceramic rectangle, about the size of a domino, the color of liver.  It has been shattered, painstakingly reconstructed and mounted on a metal frame. Dyson removes the artifact, it its insert-gas, and sets it on a specially-designed cart.  He handles it like the Turin Shroud. Dyson closes the cabinet.  Turns to the one next to it.  Opens its door.  In this cabinet is a larger object... an intricate METAL HAND AND FOREARM. At the elbow, the metal is twisted and crushed.  But the forearm and hand are intact.  Its metal surface scorched and discolored, it stands upright in a vacuum flask, as if saluting.  This is all that remains of the terminator Sarah destroyed.  Dyson stares at it, lost in thought.  The he closes the cabinet, BLACKING OUT FRAME.",

A plate glass window EXPLODES and Terminator crashes through to the tile floor like a sack of cement amid the screaming crowd. 44D     T-1000 turns without a word and heads back through the store after John, accelerating slowly into a loping, predatory run. 44E     Terminator is totally still.  A JAPANESE TOURIST cautiously steps forward and takes a picture of the body.  Suddenly, Terminator's eyes snap open.  The stunned tourist backs away. He sits up and looks around.  Gets his bearings.  Rises smoothly to his feet.  All servos seem to be working fine.  The tourist's camera whirs as the motor-drive runs on by itself, taking shot after show. The owner isn't even looking through the eyepiece, he's so shocked. 45      INT. PARKING GARAGE John is frantically pumping the kick-start of his bike, scared shitless and the damned thing won't start.  His hands are shaking so badly he can't find the choke.  He looks up to see -- The T-1000 running down the corridor toward him. John fumbles with the choke.  The bike catches.  He slams it in gear and spins the bike out into the main aisle of the garage. John looks back... the T-1000 is behind him, running.  He twists the throttle and guns the little bike forward.  Incredibly, the T-1000 is gaining.  This nightmare isn't happening.  John races out the exit ramp, and charges right into the street. 46      EXT. STREET John shoots into the busy traffic.  Cuts off a BIG-RIG TOW TRUCK. The DRIVER swears.  Hits his air horn.  What the driver doesn't see is the cop, running faster than O.J. Simpson at the airport, who emerges onto the street and runs back at his truck. 46A     IN THE TRUCK.  The driver hears a thump as something slams against his door, then feels himself pulled right out.  T-1000 slides in and takes his place.  The truck is still rolling along about 25 mph.",

It can see him, up ahead, weaving through traffic. 46B     Out of the garage entrance, Terminator roars onto the street on the Harley. He accelerates after the others. 47      EXT. FLOOD CONTROL CHANNEL John slides his bike down the service ramp faster than he's ever done it before.  He races along the bottom of the canal, turning into a narrower tributary which has vertical sides. He looks back.  No sign of pursuit. 47A     Suddenly he sees the sun blocked out by a great shadow. The Kenworth tow-truck... big as a house, all chrome and roaring diesel engine... crashes through the fence and launches itself right into the center of the canal. It crashes down, 15 feet to the ground, going about 60, hits at an angle and tears into the concrete wall with a hideous grinding of metal.  It ricochets back and forth between the walls then, bellowing like a gunshot stegosaurus, it just keep on plowing forward, gathering speed. 47B     John looks back and sees this wall of metal almost filling the narrow concrete canal and he milks every last bit of throttle the little bike has.  The Kenworth is all muscle, tearing along the canal like a train in a tunnel.  Its big tires send up huge sheets of muddy spray, backlit in the setting sun.  It looks like some kind of demon.  And... it's gaining. 47C     ABOVE THEM, on the service road running parallel, Terminator is fighting to overtake them.  He looks down and sees John with the tow- truck from Hell catching up to him.  It is only about twenty feet behind him and still gaining. 47D     ANGLE IN THE CANAL, looking back past a desperate John, at the wall of metal filling frame behind him. 47E     ABOVE, Terminator cuts the bike suddenly hard to the left, leaving the road.  Hitting an earth embankment just right, he jumps the bike into the air like Steve McQueen in \"The Great Escape\" and vaults the fence bordering the canal.  It slams down at the edge of the canal and tears along, inches from the drop-off on a dirt path, accelerating past the truck in the canal below. 47F     John hits some water and slews momentarily, loosing speed.  The massive push-plate on the front of the truck slams into his back fender.  Panicked, he pulls a little ahead.  All this is happening at about sixty miles and hour.  Top speed for the little dirt bike. 47G     SLOW MOTION as Terminator jumps the bike again.  This time the 700- pound Harley sails out into space and drops into the canal.  It arcs down between the truck and John, hitting on its wheels.  It bottoms out, an explosion of sparks under the frame.  Only the ultra-fast reflexes of a machine could keep the bike upright.  Terminator fights for control. 47H     He guns the throttle and the powerful bike roars up beside John's tiny Honda. Terminator sweeps the kid off his machine with one arm and swings him onto the Harley, in front of him.  John's Honda weaves and falls, smashing instantly under thundering tires. The Harley roars ahead.  It hits eighty.  Ahead is an overpass, and supporting it is an abutment which bisects the canal into two channels.  The Harley thunders into one channel, which is essentially a short tunnel. 47I     The truck can't fit on either side.  Neither can it stop, at that speed.  Tires locked, it slides on the muddy concrete and piles into the concrete abutment at seventy. 47J     Terminator and John emerge from the tunnel, looking back to see a fireball blasting through behind them as the truck's side-tanks explode. Terminator stops the Harley.  John peers around his body to see the destruction.  A burning wheel wobbles out of the tunnel and flops in the mud.  Terminator revs the bike and they roar away, down the canal, disappearing around a bend. 47K     ANGLE ON THE FIRE, as a column of black smoke rises from the overpass. Smoke boils from the tunnel as well, and inside it is a solid wall of flame.  A figure appears in the fire. Just an outline.  Walking slowly... calmly. The figure emerges from the flames. It is human-shaped but far from human.  A smooth chrome man.  Not a servo-mechanism like Terminator is underneath, with its complex hydraulics and cables... this thing is a featureless, liquid chrome surface, bending seamlessly at knees and elbows as it walks.  It reminds us of mercury.  A mercury man.  Its face is simple, unformed. Unruffled by thousand-degree heat, it walks toward us. With each step detail returns. First the shape and lines of its clothing emerge from the liquid chrome surface, then finer details... buttons, facial features, ears... 47K     But it's still al chrome.  With its last step, the color returns to everything.  It is the cop again... handsome young face, blond hair, mustache.  Icy eyes.  It stops and looks around. It is a perfect chameleon.  A liquid metal robot.  A killing machine with the ultimate skills of mimicry for infiltration of human society. 47L     ANGLE NEARBY, as several police cruisers and a fire truck pull up.",

His eyes are glassy and lifeless. The spike is withdrawn -- SWIISHHTT! -- so rapidly, Todd is actually standing there a second before he slumps out of sight.

One of them hits the panic button and ALARMS begin to sound. 72      IN THE ISOLATION WARD, the T-1000 is looking in at a very stoned attendant inside the nurses' station when the alarms shriek through the halls.  It reaches into its chest and pulls out the 9mm pistol. Heads for the security entrance. 73      IN ANOTHER CORRIDOR in the maze of the vast hospital, Sarah flies past us, her bare feet slapping on the cold tiles.  The orderlies charge after her. She's like an animal in a maze.  She turns the corner, glancing off the wall, and sprints on without slowing.  She reaches a steel door. Tries it.  Locked. Footsteps like a drum solo behind her. She fumbles with Douglas' keys, breathing hard.  Jams the master in. The orderlies are bearing down on her at full tilt. Sarah gets the door open.  Dives through.  Slams it. She turns a deadbolt knob just as the first orderly grabs the latch on the other side.  He's too late. Sarah sees them beyond the window, fumbling with their keys. 73A     Sarah is in another sally-port corridor.  A jail-cell type barred door is between her and the corridors of the ward beyond. She sprints to the walls of bars, jams her key into the door. She unlocks and pulls open this door just as she hears the latch of the one she just came through being unlocked. She flings herself frantically through the barred door as the first orderly comes through behind her. She slams the bars shut.  CLANG. Her keys are dangling from the lock on the other side from her. The orderly is racing at her, white-lipped with rage. She reaches back through the bars, turns the key, and purposefully snaps it off in the lock.  An instant later the big orderly slams against the door, grabbing through the bars for her as she dances back just out of reach. He lunges against the steel bars, unbelievably pissed off. Sarah takes off running, looking back at the frustrated orderlies. They're shouting at each other, unable to fit their keys into the lock -- The broken-off key tip makes it impossible to get their keys in. Silberman shouts at them.",

She screams in utter hopelessness. Terminator, holding the shotgun in one hand, reaches down and grabs one of the orderlies with his other hand.  He hurls the 200-pound guys against the far wall of the corridor.  SMACK!  He drops to the floor. The other two orderlies react instantly, leaping onto the intruder. Terminator seems to disappear for a moment under the two big guys. Then there is an explosion of white-clad figures, as the orderlies are flung outward like they stepped on a land mine. One crashes through a window of safety glass and is caught before a two-story fall by the outer steel bars.  The other crashes through an office door, splintering it into kindling.

She opens fire, BAM-BAM-BAM -- right through the roof. Lighting-fast the lance withdraws and thrusts down again, slashing Terminator's jacket, and missing John by inches. Terminator chambers a round and K-BOOM! the 12-guage opens a hole in the ceiling. Terminator rocks out in a fury of firing/cocking/firing as the metal shafts slash down again and again.  Sarah yells in pain as one of them slices open her upper arm. 75      The doors open.  Sarah pulls John out as soon as the gap is wide enough. They emerge into the basement.  We see the Harley parked nearby. Terminator, in a rearguard action, fires another blast through the ceiling and runs out.  He throws his leg over the Harley, kicks it to life with one powerful stroke and then whips something out of the inner pocket of his jacket.  He throws it to John.  A road flare!? 76      In the elevator, the T-1000 has bashed a hole in the ceiling big enough to... Pour itself through. A massive blob of mercury extrudes from the opening.  The mass drops through the hole, down out of frame, then comes back up into frame as Officer X. It seems to need just a second to get its mental act together after doing this king of taffy-pull with itself.  It opens its eyes and sees -- 77      TERMINATOR, the shot gun held in his teeth, astride the roaring Harley twenty feet away.  Terminator twists the throttle and pops the clutch. The back tire screams on the concrete.  The front wheel lifts off the ground and the heavy bike launches in a thundering wheelie. Terminator gets off just before the bike hurtles into the elevator. The Harley slams the T-1000 square and smashes it right through the back wall of the elevator. Terminator rolls to his feet. Johns strikes the flare on the concrete.  Tosses it. Terminator catches the life flare with one hand. Levels the shotgun with the other. With his last round he blows a big hole in the bike's gas tank. Gas splashes everywhere, covering the struggling T-1000. Terminator tosses the flare.  KA-VOOOM! The explosion knocks Terminator backward off his feet, enveloping him in the fireball.  He gets up, smoking, and runs after John and Sarah toward the exit ramp. 78      AT THE EXIT RAMP.  They are partway up when a blue-and-white hospital security car comes screeching down the other way. Without breaking stride Sarah runs right at the car.  It skids to a shrieking halt.  She's in the guy's face with the .45 in both hands.",

Terminator hands the shotgun over his shoulder to John and tells him to reload.  John pulls some shells from the pocket of his army jacket and starts feeding them in. Terminator power backward up the ramp, scraping along one wall, barely in control.  Because... 79      The T-1000 is running at them out of the inferno below. This guy won't quit.  Shifting from chrome mode to cop-form as it runs. It sprints up the ramp after the retreating car.  T-1000 is gaining. 80      Terminator hands Sarah another magazine for the .45.  She snatches it, drops the other out, and slaps in the new one.  Cocks the slide. The car backs along the service driveway toward the security gate. John hands the shot gun back to Terminator. He leans out the window and takes aim at the pursuer. The T-1000's face is right in the headlights. 80A     Terminator fires, blowing a hole in its shoulder.  Shiny liquid metal visible in the hole, which then closes. 80B     Sarah, half out the passenger window, opens fire. The car crashes backward through the security barricade.",

She hasn't slept in twenty-four hours and she seems to have the weight of the whole world on her shoulder. She draws her knife from its belt sheath. Idly starts to carve something on the table top... the letter \"N\". A114    NOT FAR AWAY, John and Terminator are packing the Bronco for the trip. A115    ON SARAH, AT THE TABLE as she looks up from her carving, thinking. She watches Salceda's kids playing nearby... wrestling with a mutty dog and loving it.  Sarah watches Yolanda walking her toddler by her hands.  Backlit, stylized.  She looks over at John.  Loading guns and supplies. A116    ANGLE ON kids playing. A117    SARAH'S HEAD droops.  She closes her eyes. A118    TIGHT ON small children playing.  Different ones. Wider now, to reveal a playground in a park.  Very idyllic.  A dream playground, crowded with laughing children playing on swings, slides, and a jungle gym.  It could be the playground we saw melted and frozen in the post-nuclear desolation of 2029.  But here the grass is vibrant green and the sun is shining. 118A    Sarah, short-haired, looking drab and paramilitary, stands outside the playground.  An outsider.  Her fingers are hooked in a chain-link fence and she is staring through the fence at the young mothers playing with their kids.  A grim-faced harbinger. 118B    Some girls play skip-rope.  Their sing-song weaves through the random burbling laughter of the kids.  One of the young mothers walks her two-year-old son by the hands.  She is wearing a pink waitress uniform.  She turns to us, laughing. It is Sarah.  Beautiful.  Radiant.  Sarah from another life, uncontaminated by the dark future.  She glances at the strange woman beyond the fence. 118C    Grim-faced Sarah presses against the fence.  She starts shouting at them in SLOW MOTION.  No sound comes from her mouth.  She grabs the fence in frustration, shaking it.  Screaming soundlessly. Waitress Sarah's smile falls.  Then returns as her little boy throws some sand at her.  She laughs, turns away, as if the woman at the fence were a shadow, a trick of light. 118D-118F  OMITTED 118G    THE SKY EXPLODES.  The children ignite like match heads.  Sarah is burning, screaming silently, everything silent and overexposed. 118H    THE BLAST WAVE HITS... devouring the cowering mothers and children. Sarah's scream merges with the howl of the wind as the shockwave rips into her, blasting her apart and she... 119     Wakes up. All is quiet and normal.  The children are still playing nearby.  Less than fifteen minutes have gone by. Bathed in sweat, Sarah sits hunched over the table. Every muscle is shaking.  She is gasping. Sarah struggles to breathe, running her hand through her hair which is soaked with sweat,  She can escape from the hospital, but she can't escape from the madness which haunts her. She looks down at the words she has carved on the table, amid the scrawled hearts and bird-droppings.  They are:  \"NO FATE.\" Something changes in her eyes.  She slams her knife down in the table top, embedding it deeply in the words.  Then gets up suddenly and we -- CUT TO: A120    LONG LENS on Sarah walking toward us, striding across the compound with grim purpose.  She carries a small nylon pack and a CAR-15 assault rifle.  Her face is an impassive mask.  She has become a terminator. A120A   JOHN LOOKS UP from his work in time to see Sarah throw the rifle behind the seat of their stolen pickup, jump in and start it.  She slams it in gear.  Salceda walks up to John.",

It is one of those new rotary jobs that hold 12 rounds in a big drum. Terminator shoots the next SWAT in the chest with the tear-gas launcher.  The gas canister hits the guy's body armor and doesn't penetrate.  But it's like getting slugged in the stomach with a full- swing from a baseball bat.  The SWAT fold double and hits the tiles, gasping. Terminator is an image from Hell, a tall figure in shredded black leather, streaked with blood.  One eye is a bloody socket, the metal eye-servo glistening.  The flesh of one cheek hangs down in tatters, revealing the chrome cheekbone beneath.  The whole front of his jacket is blown open, revealing his metal armor chest. The remaining SWATs start to fall back.  One turns to run and -- KPOW!  A gas canister nail him in the back, sending him sprawling. 173F    Terminator fires three gas canisters into the lobby.  It fills rapidly with the white gas, cutting the visibility to a few feet.  It is total pandemonium.  SWAT LEADER crouches in the fog, white- knuckling the rifle.  Terminator looms suddenly out of the mist right in front of him.  POOM!  Terminator drills him in the leg with the .45.  As the guy screams and drops rifle to clutch his leg, Terminator rips his gas mask off.  The SWAT leader drops writhing to the floor, choking and gagging, clutching his bleeding thigh. Terminator walks up to two SWATs at the front doors.  POW-POW.  Leg and leg.  He snatches their masks as they fall.  The gunfire has stopped.  Nobody an see anything.  Screams and whimpers echo in the smoke. 174     EXT. BUILDING Smoke boils out of the front door as a figure emerges.  Firing the tear-gas launcher with one hand, Terminator launches all remaining rounds among the cop vehicles.  Unprotected officers run, choking and half-blind, slamming into cars and tripping over each other.  It is a total rout. 175     AT THE SWAT VAN on of the SWATs is rapidly handing out the remaining masks to unprotected cops.  A FIGURE appears out of the smoke beside him.  He looks up.  His mask is ripped off and he is handed the empty launcher.  Instinctively he catches it.  Terminator grabs his flak vest with one hand and sails him out into the mist. 175A    INT. SWAT VAN Terminator strides the length of the van and climbs into the driver's seat.  No keys in the ignition.  He flips down the sun visor.  The keys fall into his hand.  He starts the van and slams it into gear. 176     INT./EXT. LOBBY The tear gas has cleared to a thin haze.  The uninjured SWATs are tending their wounded.  They look up at the sound of shouts and a roaring engine. 176A    THE SWAT VAN CRASHES INTO THE LOBBY in an explosion of glass and debris.  Cops scatter as the van screeches across the lobby in a smoking one-eighty, sliding to a stop across the corridor which leads to the bank of elevators.  Terminator backs up until -- crunch -- he seals the corridor with the back of the van. 176B    Sarah and John stumble along the corridor, coughing. They leap into the back of the van and Terminator hits the throttle. The van roars across the lobby and exits through blown-out windows.",

It rockets across the gap to the hovering chopper and -- 178A    SLAMS into the canopy.  The impact of bike and rider pitches the chopper radically.

Nightmarishly, the pilot watches as the T-1000 smashes its head through the plexiglass canopy and rapidly POURS ITSELF through the jagged hole.  It reforms instantly into its previous self on the passenger seat. 178C    It hurls the pilot out of the chopper and slides into the driver's seat. The chopper is auto-rotating, spinning out of control.  It drops toward the parking lot.

Sarah and John are catching their breath, still coughing from the CS gas.  Terminator look to the rear-view mirror.  He sees the xenon searchlight of the chopper behind them, gaining. Sarah looks around the inside of the SWAT van.  It is a rolling armory.  There are rifles, ballistic vests, all manner of equipment.",

Then she grabs two M-16s from the wall-rack and loads them.  She starts on a shotgun as -- 180     The SWAT van weaves through sparse traffic at high speed. Terminator slews the unstable van around cars and trucks which seem to be crawling.  The van hits it top speed of eighty.  They swerve to miss the back end of A WHITE 18-WHEEL TANKER. 180A    The chopper swings in behind them, closing fast. 180B    T-1000 reaches through the shattered canopy with the MPK machine pistol and FIRES.  The back of the can CLANGS WITH HITS.  The door windows are BLOWN IN. Terminator weaves the van, trying to throw off the T-1000's aim. The unstable vehicle screeches and wobbles on the edge of control. One of the doors is kicked open.  Sarah, wearing a ballistic vest, crouches in the doorway, whipping up the M-16.  SHE OPENS FIRE. 180C    Bullets riddle what's left of the chopper's canopy as the T-1000 returns fire. The van is stitched with hits. 180D    INSIDE THE VAN holes are punched through the thin sheet-metal walls, ripping up the interior.  The vests covering John are hit repeatedly. We see that Sarah has hung two Kevlar vests on the inside of the back door and she ducks behind these as bullets hit around her.  She pops back out and fires in controlled bursts.  The M-16 empties and she grabs another. 180E    Terminator serves around a car which is changing lanes, hitting it and knocking it skidding. 181     OMITTED 181A    Sarah reloads and keeps firing.  The van swerves around a Toyota.  A moment later the helicopter passes it, the rotor just clearing the top of the car. 181B    T-1000 FIRES the machine pistol. 181C    Sarah has popped out to fire.  She takes a HIT in the thigh, and several rounds hammer into her Kevlar vest.  She is thrown back onto the floor of the van.  She lies there, an exposed target... 181D    Terminator sees the T-1000 preparing to fire again. He locks up the van's brakes.  Tires scream as the vehicle shimmies. Sarah is thrown forward, sliding up to the bulkhead next to John. 182     And the helicopter SLAMS RIGHT INTO THE BACK OF THE VAN. The rotor disintegrates.  The back doors of the van are crushed in as the canopy, the whole front of the fuselage is HAMMERED INTO JUNK, trapping the T-1000 inside the twisted metal.  The chopper hits the pavement, flips, sideways, and cartwheels... smashing itself into a shapeless mass of twisted metal. It falls away behind the van, tumbling end over end. 182A    Terminator fights to control the van, which is fishtailing violently from the impact.  It smashes up against the center divider, screeching along the concrete, and then pulls away.  Terminator puts the hammer down and the van accelerates.  He swerves to avoid an UGLY PICKUP crawling like a snail ahead.",

The spinning chrome hubs tear into the passenger side door and the guard rail screeches along the other side. The pickup bucks and shakes insanely.  It ricochets violently between the big-rig and the divider Horrible SCREECH of tortured steel. Sparks pour in sheets of fire from both sides. The windshield shatters as the door-posts buckle in. Metal and glass shower in through the side windows. The frame twists and buckles.  John feels like the fillings are being shaken right out of his teeth. The wooden camper disintegrates, falling away as kindling behind them. 191C    INT. TANKER CAB T-1000 holds the wheel hard over, mercilessly grinding the pickup. The whole rig jerks and shakes with the violence of the sustained hammering. 191D    INT./EXT. PICKUP Terminator slides toward the passenger side.

It flies over the top of the truck. 191E    Terminator pushes his upper body out over the dashboard and stands up. He turns and aims the M-79 one-handed. 191F    POOM!  The grenade misses the T-1000 by less than a foot.  It EXPLODES against the front bulkhead of the tanker, almost at the top.  Liquid nitrogen pours from the opening, swept back by the 60-mph windstream. 191G    The big-rig swerves as T-1000 regains control.  The tanker swings like a pendulum behind the cab. 191H    The pickup accelerates, getting back out in front by a few yards. Behind it the big-rig is trailing a swirling comet-tail of nitrogen vapor.  It is gaining again. Terminator, still standing, opens the breech and starts to reload. 191I    John cuts across the highway and takes an OFF RAMP. 191J    T-1000 swerves the smoking behemoth across the lanes and down the ramp after him, still accelerating.  It is twenty feet behind them and closing when Terminator closes the breech and FIRES. 191K    The grenade hits the front grill and EXPLODES. The radiator is destroyed, along with half the hood.  Steam blasts out, obscuring the whole front of the truck. 191L    The semi rams the back of the pickup again.  Spewing smoke and vapor like some demon locomotive, the tractor-trailer pounds into the back of the pickup.

Terminator struggles to reload amid the chaos and impacts.  He has THREE GRENADES LEFT on the bandolier. John isn't even steering.  They are just being pushed.  There's nothing he can do.  They are rocketing down the broad thoroughfare which leads directly to the MAIN BUILDING of the plant. 192A    Terminator pulls himself onto the roof of the pickup. He leaps to the bed, takes two powerful strides and -- Leaps onto the semi.  He climbs rapidly onto the hood. 192B    And FIRES POINT BLANK THROUGH THE WINDSHIELD. Right into T-1000's face.

The tractor is smashed back at right-angles to the tanker-trailer which begins to slide broadside. 192D    The juggernaut bucks and shudders as the tires and smoke sideways across the pavement. It begins to topple. Terminator hold on as the side of cab becomes the top. With an unholy scream, like the unoiled hubs of Hell, the whole rig slides on its side at 60 mph toward the steel mill.  A sheet of sparks sixty feet wide trails behind it on the pavement. 192E    John sees what's behind him, then snaps around to see the building looming right in front.  The huge rolling doors are partly open. No choice. He steers right through them into the mill, as -- 192F    Terminator, with one second to go, leaps from the cab -- He flies through the open doors as -- The tanker hits the building and -- 193     INT. STEEL MILL/MAIN AISLE Terminator slams to the floor of the mill and rolls, as -- The tanker-trailer smashed into a massive concrete support at one side of the doors.  Thunderous carnage of twisting metal.              o 193A    It splits wide open.  A river of liquid nitrogen pours out at -230. 193B    John hits the brakes, sliding out of control.  He slows almost to a stop but hits a steel support column head-on.  He and Sarah are slammed forward, hard. 193C    Terminator, still clutching the M-79 blooper, rolls and slides across the floor. He smashes through a railing and slams up against the base of a massive machine. 193D    The semi cab swings about the trailer wreckage, into the building, and shudders to a stop.  Liquid nitrogen sprays over the cab, flooding out around it in a HISSING WAVEFRONT OF ULTRACOLD. Freezing vapor swirls everywhere, obscuring the wreck. 193E    TERMINATOR lies still.  A beat.  Then he rolls weakly, rising on one elbow to survey the scene. 193F    IN THE WRECKED PICKUP, John stirs.  He is stunned, and blood runs from his nose.  Dazed, he realizes he is in a steel mill.  There are sirens, and he can see men running... shouting.  He turns and sees what they are running from... 193G    The wall of nitrogen vapor spreads from the demolished tanker.  It is a strange vista of fire and ice.  The huge SMELTERS pour out orange light and fire from the sides of the huge galley, while the freezing vapor rolls down the center. 193H    TIGHT ON THE WRECK.  A billowing gray cloud.  Deep inside, the shape of the cab in visible.  A FIGURE emerges, pulling itself out.  It drops to the floor.  The hissing, boiling river of liquid nitrogen flows around its feet. 194     The T-1000 staggers, moving slowly, painfully.  It has finally been affected by something.  Its feet are freezing to the ground as it walks... 194A    CLINK!  One of its feet breaks off at a glassy angle.  It stumbles forward, and -- 194B    Its other foot snaps off.  As it catches its balance on the stump of its other ankle, 194C    the whole lower leg shatters at the impact.  It topples forward to its knees. Catches itself on one hand.  Liquid nitrogen flows around the hand. Now the hand is stuck to the pavement. 194D    The T-1000 pulls and... CLINK!  The hand snaps off at the wrist. It looks stupidly at the glassy stump of a wrist.  For the first time we see an expression on its face we know to be a true one... The expression is pain.  Agony.  Its mouth opens in a soundless scream as the hoar-frost races up its legs, across its body. 194E    And that's the position it freezes in. It has become a statue, kneeling in the frozen vapor, that surprised look of agony frozen on its face. The liquid nitrogen stops flowing and begins to evaporate. 194F    Terminator, just beyond the boundary of the cold, can see the T-1000 clearly. He draws his .45 and aims.",

It is a cul-de- sac, blocked on the end by the base of an IMMENSE SMELTER CRUCIBLE. They turn to watch the titans battle in silhouette, backlit by the molten sparks falling from the furnaces above.  The battle which will decide their fate. 204C    Terminator grabs the T-1000 and hurls it with awesome force against the opposite wall of the narrow alley.  In less time than it would take to turn, the 204D    T-1000 morphs trough itself, front to back... face emerging from the back of its head. 204E    It comes off the wall straight at Terminator, who smashes his good fist into its face.  The pile-driver blow buries Terminator's fist almost to the elbow. 204F    But the T-1000's head morphs in a split-second into a hand which grips Terminator's wrist, and the head \"emerges\" somewhere else, the geometry shifting faster than we can follow. 204G    The T-1000 slams Terminator into a large machine, jamming his arm into the moving works.  A massive sliding bar SCISSORS HIS ARM, smashing it into junk at the elbow, pinning him in the machine. Terminator strains against the machine pinning him.  We hear his servos whining with overload.  The T-1000 turns and lopes toward Sarah and John. Sarah screams and hurls John into a gap between the machines.  He falls into a maze of pipes and girders. 205     INT.

A steel needle slams through her shoulder, pinning her. The polymorphic killer cocks back its other hand.  The index finger extends as a gleaming needle, toward her eye -- T-1000 Call to John.  Now. 207C    WHAM!!  SOMETHING whistles down on the T-1000 with such force that is cleaves it head and body in two down to the naval.  The 6-foot steel bar is imbedded in its body.  Terminator hurls the killer off Sarah. 207D    The T-1000 pulls the steel shaft out of itself and attacks him with fury. Swinging again and again.  Hammering Terminator back.  Terminator falls back against the wall. Behind the T-1000 is an enormous I-beam, hanging from two chains.  It is used to lift ingots into the smelters, and it runs on a linear track. 207E    The T-1000 grabs the I-beam and rolls it down the track.  Straight at Terminator.  The two-ton girder smashes into his chest, crushing the armor. The T-1000 pulls the I-beam back, and then heaves it forward again. Terminator turns and takes the second blow on the shoulder.  We hear metal crush and break inside him.  He sags, turning to grip the wall... The third blow slams into his back, smashing his spine and pelvis.  We hear servos ratcheting and failing.  He drops to his knees, crucified on a wall of machinery. The fourth blow is centered between his shoulder blades.  Sound of crushing metal.  His skull is partially caved in. He slides to the floor. 207F    ON THE T-1000, emotionless as it walks forward. 207G    TERMINATOR is a pathetic shape on the floor.  He is trying to crawl, feebly. Dragging his malfunctioning legs behind the crushed spine.  His arm stump screeches on the tile floor as he inches himself forward.  His exposed machine eye burns red with determination. We see his prize.  He has the M-79, with the breech still open, cradled in the crook of his ruined arm.  He good hand, the exposed steel one, is reaching for the last grenade, which is visible under the skirt of the massive smelter base.  His metal fingers reach out for it as -- 207H    The T-1000 raises the heavy steel bar over his head and stabs it down with unbelievable force.  It punches into Terminator's back, through a gap in the shattered armor.  The T-1000 levers it back and forth, widening the hole.  Then is raises the pointed bar again and slams it down. It punches right through.  Emerging from Terminator's chest. And into the floor.  He is pinioned.  The cyborg sags face down and stop moving.  The light goes out of his eye.",
