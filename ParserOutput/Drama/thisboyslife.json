Everyone watches as his score is raised from behind the concrete wall on which the bull's-eye hangs. The score comes:     84. There is a smattering of applause, and it's Dwight's turn. From his stance, Dwight looks as if he is a pretty good shot. He's nervous, though, because Caroline is going to shoot, and he squeezes off his TEN SHOTS in RAPID SUCCESSION, hardly pausing to breathe. A pause, and then his score is raised: 73. Dwight smiles an inappropriate smile and hands the Winchester to Caroline. There are a couple of whistles as Caroline takes her position, and someone in the crowd yells out, \"Oh, Mama, shake that thang!\" Caroline ignores it, taking her shooting stance, which is surprisingly graceful and professional-looking. She SHOOTS her TEN BULLETS, taking time to breathe once, deeply, between each shot. The pause, and her score is raised: 93.

Then, suddenly, Arthur gives out completely -- he falls on top of Toby, pressing him deeper into the mud. With his last bit of strength Toby throws the bigger boy off him and sits up, while PEPPER BARKS FURIOUSLY at him and threatens to nip his leg.

DWIGHT AND CAROLINE'S LIVING ROOM - SAME NIGHT           83 (LATER) \"The Lawrence Welk Show\" is ON the TELEVISION. Dwight, Caroline, Skipper, Norma and Pearl and Toby watch an Irish tenor sing a lugubrious ballad. Dwight stands in a corner of the room, his saxophone to his lips. He's playing along with the MUSIC, but silently. Occasionally he gets overcome and accidentally causes the saxophone to squawk. The Irish ballad ends, and Lawrence Welk's Champagne Orchestra strikes up a lively polka. Dwight takes a sip of his drink and grabs Caroline, pulls her to her feet, and begins to dance with her. A polka can be a decorous, contained dance. He dances Caroline vigorously around the living room, out into the kitchen, around the table, and then back again. Dwight is really good, and Caroline matches him every step of the way. Skipper turns the  VOLUME UP and Dwight kicks the dance into an even higher, wilder gear: The kids clap on the beat, the two whirl and stamp and spin. (CONTINUED)",

They both shine flashlights around the dark attic, illuminating old magazines, dolls, etc. Dwight says, \"I know I put 'em up here somewhere.\" Then Toby's flashlight lands on the unusual tub with the four blue stars which had held the beaver. Forgotten all this time, the beaver has transmogrified into a weird, two-foot high pile of what looks like cotton candy. And, hideously enough, the cloud-like stuff is still in the shape of the beaver. Then Dwight says, \"Shit -- the roof must've leaked on 'em.\" Toby turns to where Dwight shines his flashlight on the ten boxes of chestnuts. Also forgotten, the chestnuts are    covered with mold, too -- but a different kind: this     is wet, slick-looking stuff that rises off the chestnuts    like dough in a breadpan. A spasm of rage crosses     Toby's face, and he turns and bangs out of the attic. 100   INT. DWIGHT AND CAROLINE'S LIVING ROOM - NIGHT (LATER)",

Alone among all the other players, Toby wears his street shoes. Heavy squarish brogans, they CLOMP, and THUD as Toby runs up and down the court. The leather soles slip like skates on the highly-polished floor, and Toby falls repeatedly. At first the crowd is silent, collectively embarrassed at the boy wearing these strange shoes. Then Toby takes a particularly hard fall, and somebody laughs. The crowd in general takes it up, and soon there is GENERAL LAUGHTER whenever Toby's shoes SQUEAL particularly loudly, or whenever the shoes trip him up or cause another boy to stumble. Soon one WOMAN'S HIGH-PITCHED LAUGH DOMINATES the gymnasium. The laugh is hideous, shrill and mindless, like some ringer planted in the audience of a situation comedy. Toby sees Norma necking with some guy and is horrified. Toby slips and slides, falls and rises. All the while his expression is hard as stone: he will get through this or die. And, like a mantra, he mutters one phrase over and over: \"gotta get out, gotta get out, gotta get out, gotta get out.\" Finally he makes a basket. One VOICE from the audience YELLS out \"Okay, kid -- way to go!\" and then two or three people APPLAUD. Instants later, Toby catches a rebound and makes another basket. The fickle crowd decides to love an underdog and APPLAUDS heartily for the boy in the funny shoes. But Toby's expression never changes. 102   INT. DWIGHT'S GARAGE - SAME NIGHT (VERY LATE)",

He lands a blow between Dwight's eyes that bangs the man back against the wall. Dwight grabs the pan with the hot water from the hotdogs, flings it at Toby. Most of it misses. Again they grapple. Toby manages to throw Dwight down, then grabs a broom that has fallen to the floor, presses it against Dwight's throat, using his good hand and one knee.

Pearl in horror, Toby in pain. Pearl runs into her bedroom. Toby reels back in pain, holding his freshly-bleeding hand. Dwight takes his chance, grabs Toby by the throat, forces him down onto the floor and begins to choke the boy. Toby's eyelids begin to flutter. He's losing consciousness. WHAM!
