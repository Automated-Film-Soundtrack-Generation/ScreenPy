LONDON STREETS - NIGHT                                 168 A black Cab pulls up at the lights. Another black cab pulls alongside it. The two drivers acknowledge each other, chatting as the lights change to RED, but in no hurry to move. An impatient woman passenger flicks a look at the passenger in the opposite cab, wanting to share this moment of passenger outrage. We see ALLELINE'S profile staring stonily ahead. We follow his cab as it peels off into a FAMILIAR street, driving towards the house where we met Polyakov. 169    EXT. HAMPSTEAD PONDS - DAY                                  169 Smiley slips into the water. It's late afternoon. Very still and calm. Very few swimmers.

A MAN'S HEAD appears, swimming up to the platform through the reeds. An old QUEEN, his face almost purple with the cold. He clings to the edge of the platform for a moment.",

The door is a little ajar and through the opening we catch a FLASH of movement in the room beyond - a COUPLE in a passionate embrace, glimpsed for a moment before they disappear out of sight. We can hear what may be their love- making. And a RECORD IS PLAYING. The same CHARLIE RICH track Smiley reacted to in the Islay Hotel. Smiley stares at the mail in his hand as if unwilling to look up. He pushes open the door and moves into... 175   INT. SMILEY'S HOUSE - DAY                                   175 ... which is EMPTY.
