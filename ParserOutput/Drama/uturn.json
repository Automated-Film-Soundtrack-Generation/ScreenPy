Every step seems freighted. INT. BEDROOM - SIMULTANEOUS GRACE is in a quandary. How many seconds before Bobby walks in to kill her? Or can he really kill her? She's not sure. She looks around the room frantically. Picks up a lamp, puts it down. She looks quickly through her closet, rummages below in the boxes. Suddenly she finds it. A dangerous looking Indian HATCHET with a feather hanging off its bindings. It's a formidable piece of iron, quite capable of splitting a skull or impaling flesh. Grace hears the footsteps just outside the door. She runs behind the door. A moment later, the bedroom door creaks open and BOBBY quietly enters, approaching the bed. We sense the doubt in his eyes as to whether he can kill her. In a reverse POV, Bobby sees the outline of Grace in the bed as victim...closer, closer.  He now lifts the edge of the bedcover but sees a blanket bunched up to resemble a human figure. He suddenly hears a foot fall behind him, then he feels her presence. He spins. She's directly behind him , hatchet raised. His life is in her hands. His eyes, locked in an eternal moment. Her eyes, the hatchet.",
