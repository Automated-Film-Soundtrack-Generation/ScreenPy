Behind the rows of beautiful black and white horses, Jacob catches flashes of pink sequins...pink tights...pink sequined gloves of a WOMAN caressing and whispering to them. She is MARLENA. Her shimmering eyes and hair. Her porcelain skin. Her pink sequins make her glisten and sparkle... Jacob is spellbound as he watches Marlena's gift with horses; Marlena uses signals with her whip or clicking sounds with her tongue to communicate with the horses: they line up at her subtle command, they raise their hooves, they bow down to her, rise up on their hind legs... She clicks her tongue and one White Silver Maned Horse lifts a hoof for her to inspect. She clicks for him to take a step. Jacob notices the Silver Maned Horse walks tenderly on the foot. He decides to help....Approaching the shimmering Marlena, Jacob looks like he's been shovelling shit all day.",

The crowd goes wild - clapping, throwing peanuts, whistling. Rosie only moves in fits and starts, causing the rest of the Spec to pass them by at times. She trots ahead of August and then when August reaches her she stops, making August halt awkwardly. August feels humiliated until: The crowd laughs, thinking it's the act. They applaud. August realizes the crowd loves it. So August, the performer, starts to play the infuriated fool to the audience, acting comically angry and frustrated with Rosie.. But when he turns back to Rosie, he is red-faced with real anger, poking under her shoulders with the bull hook. After three stops and starts, August plunges the bull hook sharply into her shoulder blade...and Rosie takes off at a faster speed, curling her trunk in the air. The crowd cheers!",

Just as Rosie bolts out of the Big Top, Marlena grabs hold of the pole above the entrance and is left hanging there as Rosie exits the Big Top... For a moment, the audience doesn't know if this is part of the act. Jacob wants to run to help her... But Marlena quickly decides what to do; She lets go of the pole with her left hand and quickly swings around so she is facing the audience, still hanging from the pole. Her face lights up and she points to her toes. The Band Leader takes this as a signal and conducts the band into a drum roll. The crowd relaxes and applauds. Marlena begins swinging, gaining momentum as the band roll mounts. Soon, in one final burst of performance inspiration, she releases herself from the pole, sails through the air tucking her body into a ball, rolling twice, uncurling for one sideways rotation and lands firmly in the sawdust in her feet. She straightens up and thrusts her arms in the air. The crowd goes wild. The Band plays victory music. Coins are thrown from the bleachers. Even the Spec performers cheer. August acknowledges the audience's response by bowing as if it were all his creation. But after a moment, Jacob can see Marlena is in pain as she turns and subtly limps out of the Big Top.
