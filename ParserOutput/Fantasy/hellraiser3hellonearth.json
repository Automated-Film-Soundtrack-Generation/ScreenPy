Is the monster already in the house? Very slowly, very carefully, Joey begins to move round her apartment.  Hardly breathing, making no sudden movements, she checks her doors.  The kitchen ... empty.  The bedroom ... empty.  The bathroom ... empty. Joey stands back in the center of her main room, facing out to her big picture window.  Slowly, she lets out a big breath and then draws an equally slow one in.  Maybe it's alright ... maybe the monster isn't here ... maybe ... Magically, eerily, slowly, the Box begins to rise from Joey's hand.  Her eyes stare in horror as it ascends through the air.",
