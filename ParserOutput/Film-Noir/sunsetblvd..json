Most of the men are in slacks and sweaters, and only a few of the girls in something that vaguely suggests party dress. Abe Burroughs sits at a small, guest-festooned piano and sings Tokio Rose.  By the door, a group of young men and girls respond to the song by sing1ng Rinso White or Dentyne Chewing Gum or something similar, in the manner of a Bach choral.  Artie Green, a dark haired, pleasant-looking guy in his late twenties, is conducting with the ladle from the punch bowl. The door behind some of the singers is pushed open, jostling them out of their places.  In comes Gillis, his hair and face wet, the collar of his Vicuna coat turned up.
