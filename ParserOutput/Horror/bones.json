He stops.  And it stops.  He walks on and it follows: As he hurries to the next pool of light and safety, his ears strain for the nearly silent padding and wheezing steadily following.

As soon as he does, the dog releases Jason, and disappears as fast as it appeared, back into the darkness.

The two boys DJ-ing. They're accompanied by the crooning voice and dancing body of Bill's step-sister TIA, 29.  Bill's black.  Tia's white.  And Maurice is not of this earth. Bill's turntablizing: his hands dance between two competition style direct drive turntables tilted side by side, playing them like an instrument. While Maurice plays in and around and out of Bill's rhythm, with his 6 top-loaded computerized CD players, the boys hand the beat back and forth and up and down, building outrageously, till Maurice tips it over the top.",

Behind him, the shadow we glimpsed grows, elongates.  Patrick notes another door.  This one padlocked.  Sensing someone or something behind him, Patrick turns with the flashlight. Nothing there.  But the Bones-shadow is behind him again. Again he feels something and again he turns the flashlight around: nothing. Except the Bones-shadow is again...behind him.

Where it stares intently at the sleeping Jeremiah, who begins to toss and turn.  He settles again on his back.  His head tilted back, his soft, vulnerable throat exposed. The dog steps closer to the bed.  We can almost feel the dog's hot fetid breath inches away from his throat. The dog stares at Jeremiah.  And for just a second the long doggy face wavers and changes: in shifting shades of black, a ragged red demonic face ripples beneath the black fur -- and looks for an instant as if it were about to lunge and rip out Jeremiah's throat! But at the last second it freezes.  Head cocks and ear lifts as if hearing something in the wind.  Its master's voice, perhaps.  And then the dog reverts to normal and pads out of the room as silently as it entered. This portion of the screenplay is originally pages 60-62.

She's about to knock when she instinctively freezes.  We can almost see the hairs standing up on her neck one by one. She looks around -- what is it?  A sound, like a moan.  Is it her name?  Or just the wind. Suddenly, with a creak, the door swings open. She takes a hesitant step into the building.  Suddenly she jumps, as a door to her left flies open. It's just Patrick.

Bill and Patrick pull Cinnabar and Tia out the door -- they're the last in the room. Suddenly the razor stops, freezes in mid-air and zips back into Bones' waiting fist - just like a boomerang.
