THE FISHING BOAT is tied-on at one end of the pier and THE GUERILLEROS are moving through the area, scavenging. This time CHICO helps MARIA with the SIPHON HOSES. TONY lingers sullenly near the fishing boat which has its motor still idling. MARIA'S SIPHON HOSE is stuffed into the gas tank of A LARGE TRAWLER. She sucks on the hose and, unexpectedly, foul tasting liquid fills her mouth. MARIA AY! GASOLINA! GASOLINA! Without warning, A FIGURE pops up from behind the side wall of the trawler. He reaches out and grabs the woman, pulling her against the boat, his arm around her neck, a pistol to her head. TONY sees the action. He dives into the fishing boat, crawls over to his RIFLE and scrambles towards the pilot's controls. With a lightning move, MARIA pulls A KNIFE from her belt. She wrenches around and PLUNGES THE BLADE INTO HER ATTACKER'S CHEST. The man staggers back, screaming. MARIA breaks away and runs across the dock. THE MAN FIRES HIS PISTOL wildly. MARIA IS HIT IN THE ARM. She tumbles forwards onto the decking. TONY reacts, OPENING FIRE WITH HIS AUTOMATIC. BULLETS RIP INTO THE ATTACKERS CHEST: HE FALLS OUT OF THE TRAWLER onto the dock, but TWO MORE GUNMEN appear behind him, mean-looking desperadoes with RIFLE SPITTING LEAD. TONY ducks as low as he can. He grabs the controls and pilots the fishing boat along the edge of the dock toward the downed woman. 18",

There's a SUDDEN, STARTLING MUSIC STING and, with it, A ZOMBIE appears inside the open window. Grotesque and drooling dark SALIVA, its hungry mouth lunges at MIGUEL'S left arm. ITS TEETH TEAR A LARGE STRIP OF FLESH OUT OF THE ARM six inches above the wrist. MIGUEL screams. He pulls away from the creature, his terrified eyes staring at the BLEEDING WOUND. A zombie bite means infection and almost certain death. THE ZOMBIE leans out through the open window, its hands clawing the air trying to reach MIGUEL. SARAH pulls A GIANT .45 from her holster belt. BULLAMN! BULLAMN! BULLAMN! She FIRES three rapid shots. THE SKULL OF THE ZOMBIE INDENTS IN FRONT like a hard-boiled egg shell that's been whacked with a spoon bowl. BLACKENED BLOOD AND BRAIN MATTER FLIES OUT OF THE BACK where the bullets exit. The creature falls, destroyed. 21",

He starts to breathe heavily. His head shakes from side to side silently pleading \"NO, NO, NO.\" The flames do their job. THE FLESH CRUSTS OVER AND THE BLEEDING STOPS. MIGUEL'S SHIRT CATCHES. Suddenly his eyes pop open and he screams like the man on fire he is. He lurches away from the flame, his body slamming against the shed wall. SARAH flings the torch into the water and dives on top of the man. SARAH MIGUELITO. MI VIDA. MIGUEL MIO. MIGUEL, trying to scream but needing to vomit, is doing neither. His body is convulsing in the woman's arms. She rubs the sparks on his shirt until they disappear then she caresses him, holding his head against hers, rocking him back and forth. 26",

GET UP HERE, WOMAN! GET THE HELL UP HERE! SARAH has no choice but to help in the fight. She lays MIGUEL as gently as she can on his back. He's gone into deep shock, shivering violently. Rubbing tears away from her eyes, SARAH jumps to her feet, takes up a post and begins to FIRE AT THE ATTACKERS. THE ATTACKERS are grinning like old-fashioned pirates as their GUNS CHEW UP THE DOCK. Suddenly, just behind THE TRAWLER, we see A FLASH OF COLOUR SPEEDING BY... It's THE FISHING BOAT! The WOUNDED MARIA is steering. TONY is standing on the prow with his RIFLE FIRING... RATTATATTATATTATATTATATT!!!! ONE OF THE ATTACKERS IS HIT FROM BEHIND. HIS BACK TURNS SOLID RED and HE PITCHES FORWARDS, FALLING between the boat and the dock into the water below. THE OTHER ATTACKER (#1) turns and FIRES IN RESPONSE. TONY IS HIT IN THE STOMACH. He falls to his knees and grabs the side of the boat but he KEEPS FIRING. THE ATTACKER pivots against a mast. For a moment he doesn't realise that HIS NECK HAS BEEN RIPPED OPEN BY A LINE OF BULLETS. He tries to scream. Can't. A PLUME OF RED SHOOT OUT OF HIS MOUTH. Then he realises. He realises that he's a dead man. He falls. MARIA TONY....TONY.... TONY PULL IN! GET THE OTHERS. TONY is clutching at his BLEEDING BELLY as MARIA, in pain from her own wound, circles the boat towards the edge of the dock. 27",

TONY I detest all my sins...because... because of Thy just punishment... because of Thy...just...punish... A coughing fit interrupts his Act of Contrition. From across the open cabin, from within SARAH'S arms, MIGUEL stares. His eyes have the glaze of a madman's eyes. Despite that, and despite the physical trauma he has endured, he seems remarkably in command. MIGUEL He is dying. I will end his pain. MIGUEL draws his PISTOL. MARIA NOOOOOOOOO! TONY ...but most of all because...they offend Thee, my God...Who art all good...and deserving...deserving of all my love... MIGUEL He is dying. He knows it. MARIA You are dying, too. MIGUEL No. The disease was cut away from me. I will live. I will live. TONY I firmly resolve...with the... with the help...the help of...of Thy grace... TONY collapses. A long, gurgling breath of surrender spills out of him and BLOOD TRICKLES FROM HIS LIFELESS MOUTH. MARIA Tony...TONY! The woman folds TONY'S corpse into her arms as though trying to give it life from her own wounded body. For a long moment there is only the CHUG-CHUG-CHUG of the tired engine. Then the woman, sensing something, turns back towards MIGUEL. His pistol is raised, aimed at TONY'S head. MARIA NO! YOU CAN'T! SARAH It must be done. You know this. It must by done to keep him from... MARIA It won't happen to him! It won't happen to him! You heard his prayer. His prayer will save him. He could never become one of...one of those... devils. MIGUEL Prayers have no power to save. The knife can save. It can cut the disease away. The bullet. It can shatter the brain where the evil takes seed. These are saviours...our new saviours...our only saviours. MARIA We must wait. One day the curse will pass. One day a dead man will... will... MIGUEL One day a dead man will refuse to return, and that man will be a saint. The first saint of our century. That's a prayer, too. A catechism. Something the priests tell us to believe. MARIA You can believe this, Miguel. I'll kill you if you shoot. We must wait. I'll....I'll do it....I'll do it myself....when it needs to be done. MIGUEL No. You won't be able to do it. He will rise. He will rise and you... you will die. That madman's glaze is wet in MIGUEL'S eyes again. A grin curls his mouth into an odd shape. He freezes, staring, waiting. SARAH shows concern. 30",

HANDS reach out and grip MARIA'S shoulders, lifting her up, up from sleep. Her eyes flutter open. TONY'S face is blue-grey in the moonlight. It takes the woman a second or two to recognise that HE IS ONE OF THE LIVING DEAD. His hungry mouth lunges towards her neck. His DROOLING TEETH SINK DEEP. The woman screams. SARAH wakes with a start. MIGUEL is already awake. He's been watching all along. Now he watches still, his PISTOL idle in his one good hand, his mouth curled in that strange grin, as MARIA'S screams shatter the quiet night. At the tiller, CHICO sees what's happening. He fumbles for the AUTOMATIC RIFLE that's strapped over his shoulder. A PORK-CHOP-SIZE CHUNK COMES OUT OF MARIA'S NECK IN THE CLENCHED TEETH OF THE TONY-CREATURE. BLOOD SQUIRTS UPWARD IN A FIVE-FOOT ARC. SARAH lifts her RIFLE from her lap. She is the first to FIRE. An instant later, CHICO FIRES as well. THE HEAD ON THE TONY-CREATURE IS HIT BY RAPID-FIRE LOADS from each gun and IT COME APART ABOVE THE EYES. Its body staggers stiffly into MARIA. She tries to stand, tries to pull away, screams still bubbling in her torn throat. She topples backward over the side rail. The corpse, taller and heavier, flips rigidly over, its feet kicking skyward, and splashes in to the deep, black Gulf. MARIA, the small of her back balanced precariously on the side rail, grabs at the air trying to swing her weight back on board. SARAH springs forward. She reaches the other woman a second too late. Their hands brush but don't catch. MARIA slips over the side. A LOUD SPLASH CUTS OFF HER SCREAMS. CHICO brings the boat about in as tight a circle as possible. He and SARAH stare out over the water. The blackness out there is absolute. Visibility zero. Silence....but for the CHUG-CHUG-CHUG of the boat's engine. MIGUEL slowly raises his hand and aims his PISTOL at a LARGE, TURTLE- SHAPED SPLOTCH OF BLOOD on the hull across the cabin, the spot where TONY died. With that odd grin still on his lips, HE BEGINS TO FIRE one shot at a time in deliberate, slow rhythm. THE BULLETS PUNCH HOLES through the wooden side-wall, most of them hitting squarely in the blood stain. SARAH looks over toward CHICO who returns her look with frightened eyes. 32",

Behind him, their AUTOMATICS ready, are SEVERAL TROOPERS especially assigned to protect the captain. One of these troopers is TOBY TYLER, a good guy. TOBY is revulsed by the scene in the clearing. He drops his head, almost gagging. RHODES notices. RHODES You'll get used to this, Tyler. It's the only way. They don't bite the hand that feeds. TOBY looks up. He can't conceal his contempt for the captain. RHODES reads it in his eyes and is about to say something when a SOUND distracts him. ONE OF THE RAG-TAG ZOMBIES is running amok. THE ZAPPERS poke at the creature but that just makes it angrier. RHODES GET THAT THING AWAY FROM THE OTHERS! BRING IT HERE! ONE TROOPER has A LONG POLE WITH A WIRE NOOSE ON THE END. He drops the noose over the wild zombie's head and the wire tightens, biting into the dead flesh on the thing's neck.

He draws his own PISTOL, an enormous Magnum, an elephant stopper. SOLDIERS, taken by surprise, scatter, TOBY AND TRICKS among them. MIGUEL'S BULLETS DRAW A LINE ACROSS ONE SOLDIER'S CHEST. He dies instantly. MIGUEL KILL THE PRIEST! BURN THE CHURCH! BURN! BURN! BURN! BURN! BURN! NOW MIGUEL IS HIT but he keeps coming, his GUN SPITTING. ANOTHER SOLDIER goes down, HIT IN THE MID SECTION. THE PLATOON RETURNS FIRE. MIGUEL IS HIT SQUARELY IN THE CHEST. He falls to his knees. His RIFLE FIRES A LINE OF BULLETS INTO THE EARTH and the kicking of the gun knocks him back on his ass. He sits there bewildered for a moment, then he looks up to find himself directly facing CAPTAIN RHODES. RHODES lifts his MAGNUM but MIGUEL is faster with his RIFLE. In the next instant the muzzle is aiming straight for the captain's stomach. RHODES' smile disappears, re-placed by a sudden flush of fear. He freezes. MIGUEL Kill the priest. MIGUEL squeezes the trigger and his weapon CLICKS sharply. It's empty. The captain's smile slowly returns. He pushes the \"Attack\" button on his belt unit. THE RED COATS advance, their PISTOLS reloaded. THEY FIRE, stiff-armed and fumble-fingered, at MIGUEL. He sees them moving towards him. Something in his mind clicks and he recognises the creatures for what they are...walking dead. THE FIRST FEW BULLETS MISS. Then ONE HITS HIM IN HIS STUMP and reality gets even clearer. He starts to scream. THE READ COATS walk closer, their dead eyes showing enjoyment of the sport. BLAM! BLAM! BLAM! BLAM! ANOTHER ROUND HITS MIGUEL IN THE STOMACH. ANOTHER CREASES HIS HEAD. He tries to stand up but he's too weak. A BULLET IN THE NECK stops his screaming. Then HE'S HIT IN THE HEART. A BALL OF BLOOD PROJECTS OUT OF HIS MOUTH and he plops onto his back, dead. THE READ COATS KEEP FIRING until their guns are empty again. RHODES calmly pushes the \"Reload\" signal and the creatures obey. MIGUEL'S CORPSE twitches for a short time, then goes rigid. 60",

We'll have a little talk first. Then....maybe...I can help you out. String him up. THE THIRD SOLDIER reaches down and grabs the wounded guerillero under the arms. TRICKS stoops to help.

You've been buckin' for a shit detail lately so here's one you're gonna love. We've got two dead. Cut the heads off and get the bodies underground to the refrigerators. Fast. It's a hot day.

The picnic is breaking up now. Occasionally one of them gets surly but it doesn't amount to anything. SOLDIERS stand ready with ELECTRIC PRODS, OTHERS with GUNS. PARAPHERNALIA is being packed away. MEN CARRY EQUIPMENT in the direction of the elevator. RHODES walks up beneath where CHICO is hanging. He's careful not to step in too close. He doesn't want to get any DRIPPING BLOOD on his uniform. CHICO Please....shoot me. RHODES And if I don't? If I don't you'll come back after your death. You'll come back and find yourself hanging there...wanting to eat...needing to eat human flesh. You hate that thought, don't you? That's the ultimate sin for most of you fools, isn't it? CHICO is weeping now. With a found spurt of energy he struggles against the rope. No use. It only brings pain. RHODES After hanging up there a few days you will be mad for food...crazed! You will lust for it! YOU WILL BE WORSE THAN ANY OF THEM! CHICO NO...NOOOOOOO...SHOOT ME! SHOOT ME! SHOOOOOOOOOT MEEEEEEEEE!!! RHODES I'll bargain with you. How many of you are on the island? CHICO Two of us...only two of us...me...and him. (He nods towards MIGUEL'S CORPSE.) RHODES I don't believe you, rebel. Where are your headquarters? On the mainland? CHICO The mainland...is dead...a dead place...nobody there... RHODES Where are your headquarters, rebel? Tell me or I'll let you hang there forever...FOREVER! CHICO There are no...headquarters. There are no...rebels. Only the walking dead. Don't you see. They have won. RHODES Then why did you come here? CHICO To look...look for a place...a place to live in...an empty place...a... new...place... RHODES How did you know we were on this island? Do others know? Will others come? CHICO Nooooo. Believe me. There are no others...no rebels...nobody...it's over...it's ooooo.... The man collapses, unconscious. 66",

SOLDIERS stand around dumbly. Those with RIFLES in their hands quickly sling them onto their shoulders. They're all afraid of the captain's wrath. RHODES walks towards the line of men with fury in his eyes. RHODES Goddammit, somebody's gonna tell me who fired that shot or I'll have every last one of you chopped up for feed!!! His eyes spot TOBY, standing behind the crate he dropped earlier, his rifle slung. RHODES Step up here, Tyler. TOBY Sir! TOBY shouts the word like a West Point cadet and he bravely steps forward. RHODES stares him down, his anger turning sinister. RHODES You fired that shot, didn't you? TOBY No, sir. RHODES Let me see your weapon. TOBY hands over his rifle. RHODES feels the barrel, sniffs it. RHODES It's been fired. TOBY In the battle, sir. RHODES is sure he's found the guilty man and he's glad it turned out to be his favourite whipping boy. His body relaxes visibly. RHODES It may be that none of these chicken-shits will talk while the whole troop is present...but I know some of these men well. I'm sure that a few private conversations will tell me what I already know. You may have earned yourself some time in the Stalag, Tyler. (Rhodes glances over at CHICO'S body) Cut him down. That's another head for you to chop off. Leave it with the others. Take the rest of his body down to the freezers. Move it, shit hill. TOBY moves off. RHODES' grin returns. CUT TO: 73",

Don't be afraid. We're friends. SARAH looks into the strong, good face of JOHN, a tall muscular man, a Caribbean Islander with shiny black skin and enormous brown eyes that seem instantly trustworthy. JOHN There are soldiers near here. Guards. I'll take my hand away if you won't scream. SARAH nods and JOHN lets her go. There are two other humans standing behind the big man. There's BILL McDERMOTT, wearing the grease- covered jump-suit of a mechanic and swilling generous shots of brandy from a hip flask, and there's a smallish woman with a sensitive face who, apparently out of character, is armed to the teeth. She's a deaf mute, nicknamed SPIDER, and she is urgently signing \"Come on! Let's get outa here!\" with her hands. JOHN Right. We better get away from that Bee. He might have friends. THE GROUP starts moving. SARAH follows voluntarily. We notice that all three strangers are wearing the same pullover vests that we saw on the foot soldiers, the ones with big orange circles. 76",

                    "raw_text": "There's A HATCHWAY in sight built into A CONCRETE, BUNKER LIKE STRUCTURE. FOUR OR FIVE SOLDIERS are coming up out of the ground. They're armed with PRODS AND RIFLES. Behind the men, lurching on unsteady feet, come A HALF-DOZEN OF THE LIVING DEAD, all wearing vests of white and blue. Behind the lumbering creatures come A WOMAN AND A MAN both wearing white laboratory coats and carrying clipboards. The woman is MARY HENRIED, one of the top behaviouralists in The Cave. (We'll learn a lot more about her later.) THE ZOMBIES are pushing through the undergrowth right in the direction of SARAH and her friends. SARAH shows some alarm at this but JOHN calms her with a strong hand. SPIDER has seen the approaching danger. She silently draws A FARMER'S SICKLE from her belt. (With her other hand she draws A PISTOL for good measure.) BILL McDERMOTT unarmed, nervously takes another swallow from his flask. THE ZOMBIES are getting closer. Too close for comfort. Finally, MARY HENRIED and THE OTHERS turn and disappear into the bunker. The last man down pulls the hatch shut. The moment the coast is clear, SPIDER AND JOHN jump up from cover. THE OTHERS follow their lead. But it's too late. THE ZOMBIES have spotted them. The creatures begin to growl and make AGITATED, APE- LIKE SOUNDS. SPIDER brings her BLADE up chest-high, ready to repel an attack. SARAH lifts her own MACHETE but JOHN reaches over and takes it away from her. JOHN Give that to me. Get behind me. Stay behind me. (SARAH resists, not understanding, somewhat insulted.) You ain't wearin' a vest. They been taught not to touch the ones with the circles. There ain't no hundred percent, all-a-time rules with the Bees, but most-a-time they leave us alone. The colour on their vests tell ya how much schoolin' they got. It's the ones without colours you gotta watch out for. SARAH gets behind JOHN, his orange circle acting as her shield. He reaches around with one strong arm and pulls her in tight against his back. THE ZOMBIES, snarling and showing teeth, move through the thicket. ONE shuffles right past SPIDER AND McDERMOTT. It gets stuck in the bramble, changes course and moves on without attacking. ANOTHER ZOMBIE, a \"white\", trudges within arm's reach of JOHN, growling all the while. Suddenly it reaches its arms out and takes two angry steps towards the humans who back away. THE ZOMBIES charges. Things happen quickly. JOHN pushes SARAH away and swings the MACHETE. THE BLADE SINKS INTO THE CREATURES SKULL. BLACKENED BLOOD FLIES. An instant later SPIDER'S SICKLE PUNCHES IN BESIDE THE BIG KNIFE. THE ZOMBIE twitches for a moment, its eyes rolling, then it falls, lifeless, to the ground. McDERMOTT trots up beside SARAH. He takes a huge swallow from his flask then offers some to her. She puts the flask to her lips but nothing comes. She holds it out, neck down, to show that it's empty. McDERMOTT Sorry. Guess I don't know my own strength. JOHN wipes SARAH'S MACHETE on some thick leaves, cleaning off most of the gore, then he returns the weapon to the woman. SARAH Thanks. I can fight my own battles. JOHN I know you can. Like I said, we been watchin' you. McDERMOTT We better get as far away from here as we can. We can work the other side of the island tonight. JOHN (explaining) We found nine entrances to the Cave so far, and we ain't got the whole thing near charted yet. That's what we was doin' out here today. Huntin' for entrances. McDERMOTT Come on. They find a Bee done like this and they'll know somebody's been out walkin' where they shouldn't have been. JOHN bows his head over the downed ZOMBIE. He mumbles softly. We can't hear the words but we can tell that he's praying, reciting the good words over the corpse of the \"white-coat\". SARAH The man I was with...until today... believed that praying was for blind men who couldn't see the truth. JOHN How we gonna break the curse without a prayer or two. SARAH Curse? JOHN What is it if it ain't a curse? SARAH It's a disease. It's a...a bug...a parasite that infects the brain. JOHN That sounds like a curse to me. SARAH We thought we were escaping here. We thought we'd found an uninhabited island. Christ! This place is a worse nightmare than anything I've seen yet! JOHN I'm sure that's true, miss. And that's why we're doin' what we're doin'. What's happenin' underground here is just what Lucifer planned for this sinful race o' man. But we're gonna beat Lucifer. We're gonna put an end to what's happenin' here. SARAH Oh, what did I run into? A bunch o' Jesus nuts? Religiosos? Prayer won't stop a bullet from one of those storm troopers and prayer won't keep one of those monsters from eatin' your liver for lunch. JOHN That's why we didn't use prayers on this here white coat 'til after he was destroyed. We ready to fight when we have to. And we gotta fight now. SARAH Look. I BEEN fightin', mister. I been fightin' for what feels like a hundred years and I'm finished. I don't need religion. I don't need prayers. I need a couple guns and a couple hands. We can sail on outa here. Find another island where there ain't so much....traffic. JOHN You think you can find your boat? There's a thousand little inlets and backwaters all through here. You remember all the ways you turned to get where you are now? You leave yourself a trail? SARAH is stopped by this. She stares at the big man suspiciously, not sure whether to believe him. JOHN We didn't see the exact spot but we know about where you landed. But we ain't ready to take you there. Not yet. You see...we need guns, too. SARAH looks around her at the unlikely band of guerillas. She thinks for a moment...not very long...then she turns and starts off into the jungle. SARAH I can find it myself. I didn't come that far. JOHN Farther than you think. You'll get lost. You will. And there's Bees all through the jungle. I ain't lyin' to ya. Religiosos don't lie. SARAH No. They just try to hold you for ransom. Fuck you, Moses! I'm outa here! SARAH plunges into the brush and without so much as a look back over her shoulder she disappears. McDERMOTT We can't let her go, John. JOHN We don't need her guns that bad. Billy boy. (He's joking.) McDERMOTT The hell we don't! But that's not what I mean. She'll be dead in ten minutes out there alone. That or she'll be firin' off her automatics and wakin' up the troops. JOHN We'll split up. Billy, you go with Spider. Just an hour or two tonight, that's all. Rhodes might have extra guards on after all the commotion. We'll meet up at number six and go back home together. McDERMOTT God save us. And me with me flask dry. I'll never make it. THE GROUP splits up, moving off in two different directions through the darkening underbrush. 78",

She bumps into something, jumps back, her MACHETE high, and freezes. Cautiously she moves ahead...one step...another...another... SPLASH!!! She steps down off a hidden ledge into A KNEE-DEEP RIVER. She manages to keep her balance but her MACHETE falls into the water and drops to the bottom invisible in the dark silt. Slowly she bends down and reaches into the water. A SNAKE swims past just inches away. SARAH recoils. Before she can reach down again she hears A LOUD, ANIMAL SNORT followed by A GREAT SPLASHING SOUND. Then ANOTHER. She squints to see. SHAPES approach on the black water. ALLIGATORS, big ones, just their very tops showing as they move on a straight course toward the woman. She backs up feeling for the shore, for the ledge behind her. THE FIRST ZOMBIE GRABS HER SHOULDERS. She spins and sees the thing. It has one eye dangling out of its socket and there's a broken-off length of wooden pole stuck clean through its torso just under the left breast. SARAH smashes her RIFLE BUTT INTO THE THING'S HEAD. AGAIN. AGAIN. It keeps coming. (So do the gators. They're getting to within a few yards.) SARAH swings a fourth time. THE ZOMBIE grabs her rifle. She pulls with all her might and the creature, hanging on to the gun, topples off the ledge and into the water. When SARAH starts to climb up on the ledge, ANOTHER ZOMBIE lurches towards her from dry land. She spins around, looking for options. The gators are just about close enough to bite her ass and THE ZOMBIE that fell into the river is rising up again, covered with moss and slime and looking pissed. SARAH faces THE ZOMBIE on the bank. She has no choice. She aims her AUTOMATIC. She's just about to fire when SOMETHING FLASHES out of the darkness. It's A MACHETE. IT CLEAVES OPEN THE ZOMBIE'S SKULL. From out of the night big JOHN appears. He struggles to free his blade from the dead creature's head. SARAH scrambles up onto the muddy ledge. THE GATORS are still moving in and THE ZOMBIE, its moss-covered arms reaching out rigidly like the arms of Frankenstein's monster, is growling ferociously (almost swallowing its own dangling eyeball in the process). SARAH Are you gonna pause to say words over the dead this time or can we be on our way? Without answering, JOHN steams off through the bush pulling SARAH along behind him, his big hand tight around her arm. 79",

There are RADIO CONSOLES, both intercom and outgoing, there are VIDEO CONTROL PANELS and there are LARGE COMPUTER TERMINALS. Reflecting the panic to set up operations back when the disaster first struck, much of the equipment is placed haphazardly and not built in. WIRES run every which way, BARE ANTENNAS AND LOOSE CONNECTORS clutter the place. ENGINEERS scurry with TOOL BOXES constantly repairing, patching, trouble shooting. Most of the personnel are TECHNICIANS but there is a group of SCIENTIFIC TYPES, obvious in their white lab coats. Among these is MARY HENRIED, who we caught a glimpse of outside Entrance Two. At A SECURITY STATION, A GUARD notices something on one of his own VIDEO SCREENS which monitor key locations inside The Cave. GUARD There's activity in the dormitory! MARY and one of her assistants, JULIE GRANT, a younger girl, move over to the video console. ONE SCREEN there shows what looks like a prison corridor. CELLS WITH HEAVILY BARRED DOORS run down both sides. We can see the distinct MOVEMENT OF SHADOWS in the corridor. MARY reacts instantly stepping over to AN INTERCOM and pressing A SEND- BUTTON. VOICE (o.s. - filter) Gate twenty-three. MARY This is Mary Henried. Did anyone enter the dormitory? VOICE (o.s. - filter) Yes, ma'm. Captain Rhodes. MARY clicks off, infuriated. She hurries towards AN EXIT followed by JULIE GRANT. 81",

It's the head of one of the dead soldiers from Rhode's platoon. The hand belongs to RHODES himself. In the darkness of A CELL, A RED COAT ZOMBIES takes a hesitant step forward. RHODES tries to shove THE HEAD through the bars but IT STICKS. When RHODES lets go it stays there, wedged at shoulder height. RHODES Take it, friend. Take it. It's a present. From me to you. THE RED COAT steps forward and lays its hand on THE HEAD. RHODES Just remember who gives you favours. THE ZOMBIE pulls hard and THE HEAD pops through onto its side of the bars. The creature lurches off towards A COT in the shadows at the rear of the cell where it hunkers down and begins to RAVISH THE HEAD, TEARING FLESH OFF, EATING IT hungrily. On the cell door we notice A PLAQUE with a number (5) and, written in marker, the Red Coat's nickname, \"BLUTO\". RHODES moves past OTHER CELLS, each holding A NICKNAMED RED COAT. GRUMPY stands way back in the shadows. TONTO stands near the bars, growling. FATSO is swaying back and forth like a chubby five year old who needs to pee. RHODES stops at A CELL marked \"BUB!\". Inside we see A SILHOUETTE, tall, erect, not moving a muscle. RHODES grins. RHODES Well, Bub. I've heard about you. Miss Henried's pride and joy. RHODES steps closer and BUB snarls warningly. RHODES Surly sonofabitch. I want to make friends, Bub. Friends. I have one more goodie in my sack here. A LOUD, CLANGING SOUND interrupts. RHODES turns to see. 82",

Much of the flesh is already gone, but we can still recognise...CHICO. The zombie turns the thing up-side-down, reaches way inside, through the neck, and pulls out grey matter. JULIE backs away, fighting nausea. A spasm rises in MARY'S stomach as well and she reels away from the hideous sight. RHODES Come, come, Miss Science. You've seen worse. MARY God....damn you, Rhodes! RHODES God has damned us all. Are my atrocities worse than yours? MARY You have ruined weeks of work here! We've been trying to wean these specimens onto alligator meat! RHODES No wonder they're so....hungry. Suddenly JULIE SCREAMS, her hands flying to her mouth. THE PLASTIC BAG is still dangling from RHODES' GLOVED HAND. Inside, pressed into the thin plastic, we can see the rough outline of THE FINAL HEAD. THE THING IS SQUIRMING causing the whole bag to wiggle. RHODES drops the bag instantly to the floor. Taking care, he grabs the bottom by a loose corner and pulls up hard. THE HEAD ROLLS OUT AND SETTLES AGAINST A WALL. IT'S EYES ARE OPEN AND DARTING CRAZILY, ITS MOUTH IS CHEWING, GROTESQUELY, ON THE AIR. MARY stares in shock. JULIE runs towards the exit, trying to scream but gagging on her own acids. She's hysterical. RHODES calmly draws his PISTOL, cocks, and FIRES. THE SQUIRMING HEAD IS SHATTERED by the powerful bullet. 83",

JULIE But...we bury the heads. Oh. God! It must be torture for them! RHODES They are brutes without feeling. Though I admit that I've requested cremation for myself. Burial is an archaic tradition, even more ridiculous now than it ever was. To say nothing of the...spacing problem...on a small island like this. JULIE I thought the purpose of decapitation was to...to... RHODES The purpose of decapitation is to preserve as much...food...as possible. The purpose for feeding is to keep the beasts on our side. The fact that they can be taught to clean up our garbage or to fire a gun is a convenient side benefit, not the primary goal. The primary goal is to keep ourselves from becoming their supper. Keep them fed and they behave. Keep them hungry and they revert back to being the animals that they have always been. You saw them in there. MARY You gave them a fresh taste of blood! RHODES They will never be satisfied with anything else, Miss Henried. They want human flesh. I'm prepared to take whatever steps are necessary to see to it they don't get mine! Not while I'm still using it! JULIE has calmed herself down. Now she feels angry, betrayed. She looks at MARY accusingly. JULIE Did you know? About the de-caps? MARY I'd never seen it before. JULIE But you knew. MARY nods in the affirmative. Tears form in JULIE'S eyes. JULIE What else is there, doctor? What else do you people know that the rest of us don't? They stare at one another. Whatever bond once existed between them has been severed forever. 84",

You're....FILTH! RHODES And you're the one who builds the bomb and they says, 'I hope it'll never actually be used'. MARY is stopped...by her own guilt.

She's not medical. She hasn't been as...exposed to...to things...as some of the rest of us. She'll be alright. I'll talk to her. She'll be alright. RHODES Oh, I have no doubt. MARY (recognising threat in his voice) If you put her on the shit list because of her reaction here tonight I'll go to Dickerson. RHODES Ah, yes, our noble Gasparilla does seem to favour you lately. I understand he assigned you a roommate of your choice. The rest of us have to pick names out of a hat. MARY (reading his jealousy) Rhodes, you and I had a roll in the hay together when I first got here. It was a wholly unsatisfying experience which I do not want to, and which I never will repeat!

Her stare is fierce, her eyes daggers. RHODES I had an unfortunate little run-in with him today. In fact...you might say that Mr. Tyler is in big trouble with the...authorities. MARY You better not mess with me, Rhodes. I'd love to serve your balls to those Red Coats for lunch! Think about it! RHODES No, Miss Science. You're the one who needs to do some thinking.

A MAN AND A WOMAN are fighting. She slaps him, he punches her, she kicks him in the balls. THREE HOOKERS pound on a door. The door is opened by A NAKED MAN WEARING A DILDO on his nose. OTHER MEN, behind him, laugh wildly as the hookers enter their smoke- filled room. MARY stops in her tracks when she sees that outside A DOOR NUMBERED 83 (the door to her quarters) there are TWO OF RHODES' SOLDIERS with RIFLES in hand. The door itself is open and SHADOWS move inside. MARY turns quickly, before she is spotted, and starts back through the hallway. As she turns a corner she is grabbed by TOBY TYLER. MARY Toby...thank God...wait here. I gotta find out what's goin' on. TOBY Hey. Slow down. What is it? MARY Some of Rhodes' men. At the door. TOBY That bastard. I didn't think he'd make his move so fast. MARY It's because of me. TOBY Oh, bullshit, Mary. It's because Rhodes is a prick. MARY I want you to leave. Then maybe... TOBY We're both gonna leave. Leave the island. I've been talkin' to Tricks. We think we can smuggle out one of those inflatable rafts. They're crated up real small. They've got air canisters. There's food inside. Even a little motor. MARY I am not...a guerilla fighter, Toby. I'm not a pioneer. I'm not...I'm not strong that way. I need... TOBY Need what? Civilised order like we have down here? Christ! MARY I can work here. Maybe my work can help...help everyone. I can do more good with access to this equipment than I can off in some wasteland. TOBY For the good of mankind. That's what every monster-maker says. MARY looks into TOBY'S eyes. She's hurt, yet angry. The kind of anger that comes involuntarily when somebody strikes an already sensitive guilt-nerve. TOBY We're gettin' out. Me and Tricks. I want you to come with us. I want that more than anything. I'll send word. I'll let you know a time and a place to meet. We probably won't be able to wait around so if you're not there on the dot...well...if you're not there, I'll know you're not comin'. She grabs him, holding him tightly against her. They kiss, hard and long. TOBY pulls away, looks at her lovingly, then turns and starts toward the guarded apartment. MARY follows. TOBY (walking) I don't know what they're gonna do to me. I figure they'll just send me out to Stalag Seventeen but if...if it's worse than that...Tricks will know. Stay in touch with Tricks. As they approach the door to number 83, THE SOLDIERS there raise their RIFLE to ready positions. SOLDIER You Tyler? TOBY Yes. SOLDIER You're under arrest. I'll take your weapon. TOBY hands over his RIFLE and begins to unbuckle his PISTOL BELT. TWO MORE SOLDIERS appear from inside the open apartment. MARY What's he supposed to have done? What are the charges? SOLDIER Dunno, ma'm. We're on orders. MARY Look...I'm Mary Henried. I'm with the special conditioning center. I'm not without influence... TOBY (calmly) Mary. MARY I'll have somebody's ass for this. I'll have your ass, soldier. I'm not gonna stand here and... TOBY (more insistent) MARY! She gives up. She looks into TOBY'S eyes. TOBY I'll be alright. Just remember the things I said. Take care of yourself. THE SOLDIERS escort TOBY down the hall without force. MARY watches their backs for a time, then she flings her BOOKS AND PAPERS angrily into the open apartment. She begins to cry. 88",

There's A DIN coming off the place, a mixture of MUSIC AND VOICES that forms a disturbed blanket of noise. The place seems to seethe like a hornets' next.

A HUGE PREGNANT WOMAN plants herself right in TOBY'S path. PREGNANT WOMAN How 'bout it, baby. I'm big but I'm beautiful. TOBY pushes past her and bumps into A SURLY DRUNK. DRUNK HEY, YOU FUCK! YOU FUCK! He grabs TOBY and flings him violently against an upright on one of the long huts. THE OTHER TWO PRISONERS move on, abandoning TOBY, disappearing into the crowd. THE DRUNK pulls A RUSTED, HOME-MADE KNIFE. DRUNK I OUGHTA SLICE YOU UP, YOU FUCK! YOU CAN'T PUSH ME AROUND LIKE... PUSH ME AROUND...LIKE... Suddenly VOMIT rises in the man's throat and he doubles over. TOBY is aware of SOUNDS behind him. At his back, in the hut, A HAIRY FAT MAN, still wearing his boxer shorts and his muddy boots, is wham-bam- bamming A WHORE, who is wearing everything but underwear and boots. There are needle tracks on the woman's arms and her face looks as though she's been beaten brutally. She purses her deep red, damaged lips and blows TOBY a kiss that's meant to be seductive. TOBY moves on down the street. The place is a cesspool full of human dregs, stinking with refuse, filled with the fury and desperation of man in his last days. 91",

Another orderly, a Nordic type names DIESEL, an enormous man, assists while DOCTOR LOGAN methodically SAWS OFF THE CORPSE'S HEAD. LUKEY rushes in out of breath. LUKEY Doc Logan! Doc Logan! Dere's a lady dead out dere! Gotta hurry! Gotta hurry! Dunno how long she been dat way! Maybe she gettin' ready to come back. THE CORPSE'S HEAD ROLLS AWAY FROM ITS BODY. DOC LOGAN picks up AN ELECTRIC DRILL WITH A LONG BIT. WHZZZZZZZZZ! HE DRIVES THE SPINNING BIT INTO THE DISEMBODIED HEAD, DEEP INTO ITS BRAIN. When he pulls it out, MATTER FLIES as the motor winds down. LOGAN is a middle aged man. He looks exhausted, demoralised, a bit mad. And he looks as ill as some of his patients. There are OPEN SORES on his face and he hasn't shaved for days. He's covered with two week worth of BLOOD STAINS. He starts around the table leaving DIESEL to dispose of the \"DE-CAP\". LOGAN Bury the head. Call the guard for the rest. Get it off the table for now. We'll bring this new one in. DIESEL doesn't respond right away. He's heard something. LOGAN What is it? DIESEL The tunnel. LOGAN hears it now, A SCRATCHING, SCUFFLING SOUND. He looks at his watch. LOGAN God. It's almost sun-up. LOGAN AND LUKEY move to a spot at the back of the room. They remove SEVERAL OF THE PLANKS in the floor. SARAH'S head pops out, gasping for air. Logan recoils, his eyes wide and frightened. LOGAN Who are you? Who are you? He stands up too quickly. Dizziness makes him reel. He smashes into AN INSTRUMENT CART, comes up with A LONG-BLADED SCALPEL and holds the thing threateningly aimed at the stranger. JOHN It's OK. It's OK, Doc. She's with us. In the next moment, SARAH and the others climb out of the tunnel. JOHN This here's the hospital. That's Diesel over there, the big guy. This here's Lukey and that's Doc Logan who's about to cut your tonsils out. SPIDER, the last one to climb into the room, quickly begins collecting WEAPONS, what few the rebels have. JOHN This here's all the weapons we got. That's why your fancy automatic looks so good to us. We gotta stick it over here with the others for now. They catch us with any kind o' weapon and its death without even askin' your name. SARAH lets SPIDER take her GUN. The deaf mute signs something which SARAH can't decipher. JOHN Ammunition. You got ammunition in your pack there? I hope you do or the gun ain't worth much. SARAH roots through her SUPPLY PACK and produces THREE LOADED CLIPS AND SEVERAL BOXES OF LOOSE SHELLS. JOHN notices SOME TINS OF FOOD, MEDICINES, A KNIFE, A COMPASS... JOHN We better just hide the whole pack, darlin'. That stuff is just shoutin' out that it come from the mainland. The shit we get is all C.D. rations. Aspirins and crackers from 1958. SPIDER snatches THE PACK away rather roughly. SARAH is a little disturbed by the action. THE MATERIAL is stashed under FLOOR BOARDS beside the tunnel entrance. JOHN Let's go. You look like you could use some shut eye. Me too. We can all get acquainted tomorrow. LUKEY escorts JOHN AND SARAH out of the operating room into the main hospital area. BILL McDERMOTT pulls out his empty flask. McDERMOTT Doc, I need a fill up. I'll help m'self if it's alright with you. LOGAN nods distractedly and BILL moves to A SUPPLY CABINET which contains, among other essentials, SEVERAL BOTTLES OF BRANDY. He fills his flask eagerly. LOGAN How do we know she's alright? How do we know? McDERMOTT She's alright. Christ, Rhodes and his cossacks wiped out her whole party. Dan near got her. McDERMOTT pockets the refilled flask, takes a long slug from the cabinet bottle before putting it back, and moves out of the room. LOGAN is left alone with DIESEL AND SPIDER. LOGAN How do we know she's alright? How do we know? LOGAN repeats his question, intoned identically as it was before. He's twitching slightly and sweat is pouring down his face. THE THUNDER suddenly seems LOUDER. DIESEL Are you alright, Doc? You look... you look real bad. LOGAN I have looked bad for four years. Everyone in the world has looked bad for four years. Thank God looks don't matter as much as they once did. LOGAN, a wild gleam in his eye, moves out of the room, following where the others went, that LONG-BLADED SCALPEL still clutched in his hand. The others follow. 94",

McDERMOTT joins them and the group moves out into the rain. LUKEY waddles back through the maze of cots. LOGAN, SPIDER AND DIESEL have moved to about the center of the big room. The patients around them, their eyes bulging, look like lemurs. LOGAN How do we know she's alright? How do we know? The same intonation again. This guy's wrapping is definitely coming loose. THE ZOMBIE rises up behind LOGAN'S back. It's the woman whose wrist Lukey checked earlier. Its teeth are dripping with drool, its hands reaching out wantingly. LOGAN turns around. Calmly, but with the swiftness of a rattlesnake, he shoots out the hand that's holding THE SCALPEL. THE BLADE SINKS DEEPLY INTO THE ZOMBIE'S FOREHEAD. LOGAN pulls it out and strikes again, and again, and again, like a swordsman thrusting, thrusting, thrusting. Finally the creature collapses. LOGAN wipes the scalpel on his already blood-covered apron. RAIN WATER drops onto him from holes in the roof above. He doesn't seem to notice. 95",

It's failing miserably but trying hard. ANOTHER BLUE is busy placing LITTLE WOODEN SHAPES into their proper HOLES IN A BOARD. TWO RED COATS sit at a table attended by HUMAN TECHNICIANS. We've seen these zombies before, in the dormitory. TONTO, is...or was...a native American, probably Seminole. In front of him is A PLATE containing SEVERAL BITS OF MEAT. He has A FORK in his hand and he is idly stabbing at the meat. The other RED COAT, BLUTO, looks just like Bluto from Popeye, bulky with a thick, black beard. Tired of THE JIG SAW PUZZLE he's working on, he snarls and suddenly lunges for the meat on TONTO'S plate. He snatches a handful and stuffs it in his mouth. As soon as he tastes it, however, he pulls it back out, dribbling and spitting disgustedly. FISHER (a technician) They won't accept a substitute. They want their Alpo. TONTO has succeeded in forking a piece of meat. He moves it to his mouth and pops it in. FISHER Alright! Way ta go, Kemosabe! MARY HENRIED has entered the room. She pulls up and watches  TONTO with a kind of dubious interest. TONTO stops chewing. He looks up with exaggerated sadness on his face. Slowly his mouth opens and the chewed piece of meat slides out between his lips. He throws his fork down angrily. MARY They won't learn to use forks if they don't like the breakfast you're serving, Ted. FISHER The fork is like a game to them. If they get into the game maybe they'll learn to like the food. MARY It won't work. Suddenly BLUTO jumps up from the table. He flings his chair aside and tromps right over to MARY. His arms are outstretched and he is making a pleading, Karloff-like SOUND. GUARDS come after him but MARY waves them off. MARY It's alright! Leave him alone! MARY extends her right hand to meet BLUTO'S right and they shake vigorously. Then the dumb creature drops his arms and looks around. His brain sends no signal as to what he should do next. THE GUARDS lead him away. 98",

CLOSE ON: A TARGET, a flat, cut out silhouette of a man, BLACK TRIANGLES painted on the instant-kill-zones, brain, heart. BULLETS STRIKE the neck, the to torso, SOME RICOCHET off the wall behind. None hit the kill-zones. MARY HENRIED enters. The place resembles a Police Department target range. RED COATS stand in stalls and FIRE down LONG ALLEYS at TARGETS which pop up against the opposite wall. THE NOISE is deafening. TWO TECHNICIANS are watching the shooters and keeping score. MARY walks up to one of them. MARY Have you seen Julie Grant this morning? TECHNICIAN She should be in the behaviour rooms. MARY She's not. Hasn't shown up yet. There's AN OFF-SCREEN GROAN, the sound of a zombie trying to communicate. MARY turns and sees the tall RED COAT names BUB standing in the closest stall trying to attract MARY'S attention. (He was the one Rhodes referred to last night as \"Mary's pride and joy\".) He is wearing WESTERN-STYLE GUN BELTS, SIX-SHOOTER hang in HOLSTERS on both his hips. MARY faces BUB full with her body and delivers a military salute. MARY Good morning, Bub. BUB replies with one of those pathetic sounds that obviously mean something to him. Then he, too, salutes. MARY pulls away, heading for AN EXIT, but BUB calls after her. He makes inarticulate sounds but we catch his drift. TECHNICIAN I think he wants you to watch. MARY OK, Bub. Do your stuff. BUB turns towards the target wall looking like a gunfighter on a western street. There's A HUMMING MECHANICAL SOUND. KATCHUNG! A SILHOUETTE pops up. BUB slaps leather...fast... lighting fast. BOTH GUN come up. BLAM-KA-BLAM-KA-BLAM-BLAM-BLAM-BLAM!!! HOLES APPEARS IN THE TARGET...WOP-WOPPETY-WHUMP!!! All in the kill- zones, or damn close. BUB slaps ONE PISTOL back into its HOLSTER. He clicks open the shell- chamber on THE OTHER, dumps the SPENT CARTRIDGES and begins to reload from his belt. MARY stares at the creature's back, mixed emotions showing on her face. BUB turns to face her. Dropping a bullet, he salutes again. MARY hesitates, then salutes back. MARY Very good, Bub. That's....very good. 99",

                    "raw_text": "This is a large Situations Room that is serving now as GOVERNMENT HEADQUARTERS. In A BIG, STUFFED OFFICE CHAIR behind A DESK FLANKED WITH FLAGS sits GOVERNOR HENRY DICKERSON (former of Florida, now of the world) A.K.A.... GASPARILLA. At TABLES sit A DOZEN OR SO COUNCILMEN, Dickerson's cronies from the old Doral Country Club, close friends who were offered asylum in the private underground shelter. Now they sit in council, \"yessing\" everything the boss man says. A STATE PROSECUTOR has a DESPERATE-LOOKING PRISONER on the floor, standing with his hands cuffed. PROSECUTOR He was found with a government-issue short- wave transmitter in his quarters. He's charged with the theft of that equipment from a government installation and with possession of an illegal radio. GASPARILLA munches on SOME FRUIT. He's a fat man with a handlebar moustache that makes him look like Pancho Villa. As an indication of rank we wears a military jacket but underneath is a Hawaiian shirt with a bold flamingo and palm tree pattern. Around his neck, nestled in the rolls of fat there, is enough gold to stake a small business. PROSECUTOR I can only suggest that the court rule in favour of the ultimate penalty for this traitor. GASPARILLA You always recommend the ultimate penalty, Tommy Lee. You and Rhodes. We now see that RHODES is present, looking on with a smile. GASPARILLA All those...AGAINST...the ultimate penalty raise yer hands. None of THE COUNCILMEN move a muscle. GASPARILLA scans them slowly as he takes a big, wet bite out of a peach. GASPARILLA Ya mean ta say nobody's gonna object to the ultimate penalty in this here case? Well, what if I object? What if I object to the ultimate penalty. THE COUNCILMEN look nervous, apprehensive. GASPARILLA'S flexing his power-muscles. GASPARILLA There's been a whole lotta swingin' influence and swingin' weight arountyere lately. Does anybody at all give two shits fer what I think any more? Well, I'm a- gonna let this guy off. How d'yall like that? And I want the word ta git out I let 'im off. I let 'im off. Not this council. Maybe I can improve my image rountyere. THE PRISONER looks up at GASPARILLA, hatred boiling inside him. GASPARILLA meets his gaze with a power-mad sneer. GASPARILLA Yer sentenced ta hard labour. Stalag Seventeen. A year. PRISONER WHY DON'T YOU KILL ME! I PREFER TO DIE! I DON'T WANT TO LIVE WITH... WITH THIS KIND OF...SIN! GASPARILLA WELL, PISS ON YOU, MISTER! I JUST SAVED YOUR ASS! YOU DAMN WELL BETTER NOT GO HOLLERIN' LIKE THAT IN HERE! PRISONER I SPIT ON YOU! THE ULTIMATE PENALTY FOR YOU! BURN IN HELL...FOR THE ULTIMATE SIN! PIG! ALL OF YOU! PIGS! GUARDS drag the screaming PRISONER from the room. GASPARILLA flops back in his chair, flustered but unscarred. His skin is about a foot thick. He pitches the peach and grabs up a mango. MARY HENRIED enters the chamber and rushes toward an empty chair. GASPARILLA checks THE DOCKET on his desk, smiles, and looks up at MARY. GASPARILLA Well, Miss Henried, what a coincidence. You're just in time fer a case that seems ta concern you. Guess you didn't care about the other proceedin's we been dealin' with here this mornin'. MARY I'm sorry. I was...busy. In the lab. GASPARILLA Well, you managed ta make it here jus' in time fer this case, didn't ya? RHODES replaces THE PROSECUTOR on the floor. He smiles at MARY pointedly as he starts his speech. RHODES Sir. In the matter of the State versus Private Tyler, I don't want to... MARY (standing) Sir, Tyler is innocent of any crime against the State. Captain Rhodes is... GASPARILLA (with a mouthful of mango) Miss Henried, I think you better... MARY ...Captain Rhodes is trying to... GASPARILLA (spitting a wad of chewed pulp into his hand) MISS HENRIED, SHUT THE HELL UP!!! MARY'S eyes indicate her frustration and anger but she does shut up. GASPARILLA plops the handful of fruit pulp onto the floor wiping his fingers on his military jacket. RHODES I don't want to take up a lot of time with this. Mr Tyler shot a prisoner against orders. There are eyewitnesses. I've reprimanded Tyler and I've had him sent outside. It's as simple as that. GASPARILLA Ya had 'im sent ta the Stalag? That's all ya did to 'im? RHODES The prisoner was dying, sir. Tyler acted out of a sense of mercy. I don't believe Tyler to be dangerous, General. He just needs...discipline. Two or three months outside will teach him...discipline. MARY Sir. It's quite clear that... GASPARILLA SHUT UP, MISS HENRIED! I TOL' YA B'FORE! MARY THIS IS A TRAVESTY! CAPTAIN RHODES IS... GASPARILLA SIDDOWN, YOUNG LADY! I DONE YUP A SHIT-LOAD O' FAVOURS AND I AIN'T NEVER YET ASKED FER NOTHIN' IN RETURN! NOW HOW'D YOU LIKE TA SPEND TWO WEEKS UP T'THE VEGETABLE FARM YERSELF? THAT'S WHAT IT'LL BE IF YA DON'T SIDDOWN AN' SHUT THE HELL UP! MARY checks herself. There's a perverse air of danger fuming off the fat General. His attitude toward MARY has clearly changed. RHODES has been working on him. MARY seems to have lost this round. She can only hope that's all she's going to lose. GASPARILLA Now I think Captain's punishment is fair, considerin'. In fact I think you ain't got shit ta complain about. MARY (softly, carefully) I'm sorry, General, if I...spoke out of turn. It's just that...Mr Tyler is not here to defend himself. He has no representation. I don't believe due process is being served by... GASPARILLA Listen, Missy. I am the only due process that has ta be served aroun' tyere and one of the people doin' the servin' from now on is gonna be you. Now you been prancin' aroun' the Cave like yer ass was glass fer long enough! All that's GASPARILLA gonna change, young lady. Now if you still got a statement you'd like ta make, you can jus' hold onto it 'til tonight. MARY Tonight? GASPARILLA That's right. 'Bout eight, if that suits. We'll start out in my gymnasium an' progress on from there...to various other forms o' physical therapy. MARY shoots a hate-filled eye full at RHODES. THE CAPTAIN responds with a phoney look of sympathy. 101",

There are other items which seem contradictory, PLUSH PILLOWS, A HUGE CIRCULAR BED SURROUNDED BY MIRRORS. Delicacies of FOOD AND DRINK lie about on LOW TABLES. The room is a cross between Elaine Powers and a harem chamber. A HUGE COFFIN-SHAPED DEVICE opens and we see that the inside is lined with ULTRAVIOLET TUBES which are covered with plexiglass. GASPARILLA lounges inside the thing, sweating, having just taken a long dose of fake sunshine. All around are THE COUNCILMEN, some with COUNTRY-CLUB TYPE WOMEN, conservatively dressed and wearing suitable jewellery (obviously wives left over from the good old days), and some with SCANTILY CLAD COURTESANS. OTHER SCANTILY CLAD \"BUNNY\" TYPES are serving HORS-D'OEUVRES and pouring WINE, offering SMOKE AND SNORT. MARY HENRIED is sitting on the floor, lost in fluffy pillows, her LAB COAT incongruous. RHODES watches her from nearby. GASPARILLA AWRITE. C'MON LADIES. OFF WITH IT... AND ON WITH IT...HA HA HA... MUSIC BLARES and SEVERAL OF THE COURTESANS spring up, stripping off what few clothes they are wearing. Some strip naked, others down to panties. They hop onto various exercise machines and begin to \"workout\", tits flopping, thighs pumping...GASPARILLA'S kind of entertainment. GASPARILLA Oh, Lordy, Lordy...I'm drunk as a skunk. Look at this...will ya jus' loooooook at these lovelies! Say, Henried, you ever try it with another woman? MARY looks up at the General, not knowing whether or not she should answer, afraid of what he might try to make her do. GASPARILLA I've tried it with boys. Too strenuous. FOUR MORE WOMEN have brought in SILVER PLATTERS full of NEW HORS- D'OEUVRES, prepared carefully and laid them out like sushi. They're distributed and people eat them GASPARILLA Folks...I just couldn't resist. How d'yall like those? How do those taste? GUESTS look up, not knowing what to expect. MARY fears the worst. She looks around to see RHODES grinning. A knot comes up into her throat. She tries to swallow it down. GASPARILLA Fresh from the freezers, folks. It's what...THEY...EAT! A FEW OF THE GUESTS are revulsed. ONE MAN starts to vomit and he runs from the room. GASPARILLA Just kiddin' folks. Just kiddin'. Would I do a thing like that? I ask ya now, would I? Hah ha ha ha ha... Relief spreads and the bacchanalian atmosphere restores itself. GASPARILLA spills himself out of the tanning coffin and flops down on some pillows near MARY. He grabs up a goblet and swills red wine which runs down his front. GASPARILLA The great state of Florida. People came here fer years ta die. Retire and expire. The rest o' the country used ta think we was nothin' but a bunch o' farts and fogies. Hah! Now this here's the new Capital o' the World! Hah! They came here...died...went to hell...and the Devil sent 'em back as an army. Hah! General Gasparilla's army...MY ARMY! MARY We think there are other cities surviving. We think maybe Detroit... there's some signalling out of Philly. GASPARILLA There's no place like this place. Warm climate. This facility. Christ, there ain't nothin' like this no-damn-where! Even the Feds knew that. That's why they stored so much o' their shit down here. It's all mine now. All mine. Just let 'em try ta come after us down here, which they will some day...take a likin' ta what all we got an' come after us. They'll hafta get past my army! An army that ain't afraid ta die...ha ha ha...'cause it's awreddy DAID! HA HA HA HA.... MARY It's not a very big army. And small as it is you won't be able to continue feeding it for very long. We've got to find ways of getting them to respond without relying on... GASPARILLA You'll find the ways, Miss Mary. And when ya do...we'll sail on over to the mainland...or any other damn mainland fer that matter...and start us a recruitin' program. There's millions o' Bees out there jus' waitin' fer' a General ta lead 'em on ta vict'ry! GASPARILLA swallows another huge quantity of wine. DISSOLVE TO: 102",

GASPARILLA Well, hi there, y'all. Mary looks down at the man, repulsed and afraid. Suddenly he grabs her LAB COAT. She pulls away and he crawls after her, his belly bouncing along the floor. BUTTONS POP and the coat falls open. He reaches for her blouse. It tears away and for a moment he gets a chubby handful of bare breast. He dives into her but he's unconscious before his face reaches her chest. MARY pulls herself out from under his dead weight.

RHODES is standing near the entrance. FOUR SOLDIERS are doing the pounding. Stunned, disease-ridden faces look up as CITIZENS are awakened from sleep. Fear sweeps through the place like a tropical wind. RHODES We found two white Bees in the jungle with their heads chopped open. I want to know who's going outside the compound. I want to know how they're going out. I want to know why they're going out. Until I get these answers...each morning...some of you will die. Without warning RHODES draws his MAGNUM and...BLAM! BLAM! He shoots TWO COT PEOPLE who happen to be at close range. They tumble to the dirt floor, dead before they hit. RHODES scans the rest of the hut. He spots a familiar face, THE PRISONER from the Council Room, the one Gasparilla saved from a death sentence. The man makes the sign of the cross, knowing what's coming. BLAM! BLAM! RHODES FIRES TWO RAPID ROUNDS and THE PRISONER'S CHEST TURNS RED. He flies off his cot into one adjacent, landing on top of a SCREAMING WOMAN. RHODES AND HIS MEN leave as abruptly as they entered. SARAH is stunned. As PEOPLE around her react with sobs and more screams, she locks her eyes on RHODES. He is moving authoritatively down the street just outside the open- walled structure. He passes within inches of SARAH'S cot which is right against the outside rail. Her emotions well up inside her. She is about to jump out into the street when A BIG BLACK HAND grabs her arm. It's JOHN, who has pushed through the gathering crowd outside. SARAH Let me go! I'm the one he wants. This is all happening because of me. If I turn myself in... JOHN He's just finding another reason for bumpin' us off. Don't ya see. He needs us ta die. He needs our bodies. Behind JOHN on the street TOBY TYLER is looking on. He has heard the conversation. JOHN turns and sees him. His eyes go dark with apprehension. TOBY It's alright. I'm a friend. I need help and so do you. What's a safe place to talk? JOHN Ain't no place safe. TOBY Look...I know you have no reason to trust me. I've got friends in the Cave. I got some stuff comin' out this mornin'. I'm gonna try to get off the island. PEOPLE are pushing in closer attracted by the commotion inside the Ritz. TOBY has to make it fast. He whispers. TOBY I'm gonna have this stuff sent over to the hospital... JOHN The hospital? (surprised, worried) TOBY Yeah. My stuff's all marked with red crosses so nobody gets too nosey. Meet me at the hospital after the supplies come in. Maybe we can find a place there to talk. JOHN Maybe. TOBY drifts off into the crowd. JOHN AND SARAH exchange glances. 105",

The liquid is sweating slowly out of A MILDEWED AND ROTTING STICK OF DYNAMITE which has been softened to near-melting by jungle heat. A DOZEN TEST TUBES stand in a rack, already filled. SPIDER, another woman, SALLY, and a man, JACK, each have their own DYNAMITE STICK. Each is transferring LIQUID SWEAT...which is, of course, nitro glycerine...into A GLASS TUBE. They work in tense silence on the operating table. DOC LOGAN works with them, doing the same delicate procedure. Suddenly his hands starts to tremble. LOGAN Take it away from me. Quickly. Take it! Take it! SPIDER reaches over and, as gently as possible, takes the VIAL and THE DYNAMITE out of the doctor's hands. She sets the tube in the rack and returns the dynamite to AN OPEN CRATE, years old and crusted with mildew and mud, still half-filled with sticks yet to be drained. The danger passed, they all breathe a sigh of relief. LOGAN wipes the river of sweat from his face. His hands are shaking quite violently now. He pops pills, dry, from his pocket. LOGAN Sorry. I'm sorry. I'll, er...I'll be alright...in a moment. JOHN You're sick, Doc. You been sick for a while now. Too sick to be workin' with us on this raid. JOHN, SARAH AND DIESEL are standing in a corner of the room. TOBY TYLER is with them, sweating and obviously nervous. JOHN You've helped us enough, providin' cover, hidin' us out. Let the rest of us handle the physical stuff. It's too much for you. LOGAN It's my fight as much as yours. The things they made me do...the things they made...me...do. I want so see Rhodes destroyed. I want to see all of them, all of them destroyed. It's my duty...in the eyes of God. In the eyes of God. LOGAN is really flipso now, over the edge into banana-land. TOBY It won't work. That's pure nitro you're dealin' with there. That stuff can blow if you look at is funny. What're you gonna do, walk into the Cave carryin' those tubes on feather pillows? You don't have a complete layout of the place. Even if you manage to avoid a fight you won't know where to go. JOHN We're hopin' you can show us where ta go, Toby. TOBY Oh, no. I'm tryin' to get off this island alive. I'll help you all I can but I'm not goin' in there on a suicide mission. What can you hope to accomplish? Some radios maybe? A supply room or two? You'll all be killed and in a few weeks they'll be back to business as usual. That place was built to withstand nuclear attack! What are you gonna do with a half-dozen guns and a few sticks of nitro? JOHN We're gonna blow up the powder magazine. TOBY What? JOHN We know what's down there. We did the loading' and unloadin' when the stuff came ashore in the early days. A direct hit oughta do more than a few weeks worth o' damage. TOBY A direct hit'll blow the top off this whole island! How're you gonna fuse the stuff? How're you gonna leave yourself time to get out? LOGAN If we don't get out it's a small price to pay. TOBY You're fuckin' out of your minds! There's two hundred people down there. You gonna murder two hundred people? LOGAN Sinners! Animals! Filth! Doing the work of the Devil! TOBY What about the people here in the camp? If they don't get blown to kingdom come their food'll be destroyed, their water, medical supplies. They won't have any more power. This island can't support them all, they'll be doomed. Count me out, friends. I'm gonna get my ass outa here. Anybody wants to come along is welcome. Silence falls over the room. Finally JOHN moves towards the door. TOBY follows but before exiting he turns back to face the group once more. TOBY I wanna see Rhodes burn just a much as you do...but all those people. We don't have the right to be their judges... just like they don't have the right to be our judges. JOHN opens the door and TOBY exits. SARAH follows. JOHN looks around at the faces in the group, then he leaves, shutting the door behind him. There's a long silence, then LOGAN speaks. LOGAN We know what we must do. It's written for us in the Bible. \"They shall be driven from the land of the living down to the world of the dead. That is the fate of those who care nothing for God.\" 109",

JOHN, SARAH AND TOBY are huddled behind green cover peering out at the boat. SARAH Looks like just two. We can take 'em when the time comes. JOHN We're only about a quarter-mile from Cave entrance number five. TOBY That entrance is closest to the labs and the Bee cages. JOHN Come on. Let's go. They move off stealthily. They enter the clearing with the spectacular PLANTS that Miguel discovered. Six feet tall, their red-gold blossoms like trumpets with their bells down, these are Daturas, nightshades indigenous to southern Florida and parts of the Caribbean. SALLY AND JACK, who we saw working on the nitro sticks, are chopping off the eighteen-inch blossom and stuffing them into LARGE LEAF BAGS. They're wearing HOSPITAL MASKS over their mouth and noses. JOHN moves in to help. TOBY AND SARAH follow but JOHN stops them. JOHN Just stand guard for now. Spell us after a while. Can't breathe this grass too long or somebody hafta carry you home.

SPIDER is in major pain. She's sweating rivers, her fists are clenched, she's biting her lover lip so that it bleeds. LOGAN I know it hurts. But it won't be long. Then all the pain will be over. Oh, I wish you could hear me. GOD, GIVE HER THE EARS TO HEAR ME SO SHE KNOWS I DON'T WANT HER TO HURT SO! DIESEL Quiet! LOGAN Oh, yes. Quiet. Yes. We must be quiet. Suddenly, A ZOMBIE lunges from the underbrush, its FACE BADLY DETERIORATED and one of its hands; lost during its human life, replaced by A MECHANICAL HOOK. SPIDER stumbles. She holds her breath and stiffens all her muscles. Miraculously the nitro vials inside her do not explode. LOGAN throws himself quixotically in front of THE ZOMBIE. LOGAN FALLEN ANGEL! THIS IS THE JUDGEMENT DAY WHEN YOU WILL BURN FOR YOUR SINS! THE LORD WILL CAST YOU DOWN TO THE LOWER REACHES AND YOU SHALL FOREVER KNOW.... THWOK!!! THE ZOMBIE'S STEEL HOOK SINKS DEEPLY INTO LOGAN'S UPPER CHEST. The man's eyes reflect no immediate sensation. His speech falters but only slightly. LOGAN ...YOU SHALL FOREVER KNOW THE PAIN... THE PAIN... THE ZOMBIE pulls LOGAN towards its DROOLING, WIDE OPEN MOUTH. It's just about to bite when DIESEL CHOPS HIS MACHETE INTO THE CENTER OF THE CREATURE'S SKULL. The thing falls, pulling LOGAN, still hooked, to the ground with it. LOGAN YOU SHALL FOREVER KNOW THE PAIN OF HELL... THE PAIN OF HELL. DIESEL frees the doctor's shoulder from the hook. BLOOD FLOWS FREELY. DIESEL grabs a handful of DRESSINGS from LOGAN'S PACK and goes to work on the wound. LOGAN ...the pain of Hell...the pain...the pain... 115",

                    "raw_text": "There are only TWO GUARDS posted at the sealed entrance. One is eating from A CAN OF SPAM. The other is reading an old, dog-eared PLAYBOY. A RIFLE BARREL jabs suddenly into \"Playboy's\" back. JULIE Don't move! It's JULIE GRANT, Mary's disgruntled assistant. A YOUNG MAN, another behaviouralist in a WHITE LAB COAT is with her. They both have RIFLES. JULIE Open the outer door. Move it! \"Playboy\" slowly gets up and starts towards A CONTROL PANEL. At the last minute, he spins around, grabbing JULIE'S GUN BARREL and pushing it away. JULIE'S YOUNG ACCOMPLICE swings his RIFLE BUTT and knocks \"Playboy\" cold. Then he trains the weapon on \"Spam man\" again. JULIE moves to the controls, examines them, trips A TOGGLE marked \"LOCK\" and pushes A LARGE GREEN BUTTON. THE DOOR TO THE OUTSIDE SWINGS OPEN. Beyond is blackness with an occasional patch of MOONLIGHT ON JUNGLE GROWTH. JULIE walks slowly, carefully toward the opening. Just as she is about to cross the threshold into the night, A HUGE FIGURE leaps at her, grabbing her RIFLE and enclosing her in a strangle hold. It's DIESEL. Behind him, comes JACK, his RIFLE (Sarah's rifle) levelled off at JULIE'S YOUNG FRIEND. \"Spam man\" makes a break for it down the hall. Reacting nervously, too quickly, JACK FIRES. \"SPAM MAN\" IS HIT SQUARELY IN THE BACK. He pitches forward, dead. THE YOUNG SCIENTIST raises his gun. YOUNG MAN Hey! What the hell.....? JACK FIRES ANOTHER BURST and the ORANGE CIRCLE ON THE YOUNG MAN'S CHEST SHOW A DOTTED LINE OF RED. He flies back, a surprised expression on his face, and he flops, dead, right on top of the \"Playboy\" guard who is lying near the control booth. LOGAN ENOUGH! ENOUGH! ENOUGH! ENOUGH! THE DOC comes slowly out of the night guiding SPIDER over the threshold and into the hall. LOGAN reminds us of a crazy John Houston, floating on air in a madman's bubble. JULIE What...what is this? Who...? LOGAN It's alright, it's alright, my dear. You've simply helped us do the Lord's work. LOGAN'S SHOULDER WOUND IS BLEEDING THROUGH ITS DRESSINGS but the doctor, on a holy mission, seems to feel no pain. He guides SPIDER into the light and opens her shirt. DIESEL shoves JULIE against a wall. JACK covers her with his AUTOMATIC. LOGAN removes RED-SOAKED DRESSING from SPIDER'S skin. All over her bare chest and upper belly we see LONG, EIGHT-INCH SCARS, HASTILY STITCHED WITH SUTURE SHOWING. Beneath each is A CIGAR-SHAPED BULGE where a vial of nitro has been implanted. The woman stands on crumbling legs, her arms open outward, a grotesque lampoon of a stigmatic. JULIE What...what have you done to her? LOGAN God forgive us. Forgive us the pain we inflict as surgeons. We'll be in Heaven, child. Soon. We'll be with Him in Heaven. SPIDER Na...na...ak...aaaaaaaaaa... SPIDER is trying to signal something. She has seen that \"PLAYBOY\" is crawling into the control booth. LOGAN follows her alarmed gaze. LOGAN NO YOU DON'T I CAN'T LET YOU DO THAT! I CAN'T! LOGAN charges toward the booth. THE GUARD is half-in-half-out of the glass chamber, his hands reaching for the control panel inside. LOGAN starts to kick him, again and again. JACK Outa the way, Doc! Outa the way! There's vengeance on LOGAN'S face. He's kicking THE GUARD brutally, but that doesn't stop the man from reaching the controls. He hits A RED ALARM BUTTON. THE PANEL BUZZES AND COLOURED LIGHTS BLINK. THE DOOR to the jungle starts to swing closed. DIESEL dives at it but can't stop the steel slab. It slams with A LOUD THUNNNNNG! JACK swings into another position to get a clear shot and he FIRES A LONG BURST into the control booth. \"PLAYBOY\" IS STRUCK BY SEVERAL ROUNDS. He bounces around in the booth and collapses to the floor, dead. LOGAN, his SHOULDER WOUND POURING BLOOD, aggravated by his physical exertion, falls to floor himself, in a faint. JACK Shit! DIESEL Keep the woman covered. JACK levels off on JULIE again. DIESEL moves over to SPIDER. Pulling FRESH DRESSING from LOGAN'S BAG, the big man begins to pack them onto SPIDER'S BLEEDING CHEST. 119",

RHODES spots A DOOR WITH A CAGED RED LIGHT OVERHEAD. They can get to it by slicing through only A FEW OF THE ADVANCING GHOULS. RHODES THIS WAY. OVER HERE! SHOOT! SHOOT THEM! SHOOT TO KILL! IN THE HEAD! Their RIFLES BLAZE as they drive through the edge of THE ZOMBIE HORDE. SEVERAL OF THE CREATURES GO DOWN, THEIR HEADS BLASTED OPEN BY RAPID-FIRE ROUNDS. ONE grabs RHODES by the sleeve of his jacket. The captain turns on his heels and stares at the thing with outraged disbelief. He raises his MAGNUM and pumps TWO QUICK SHELLS INTO THE CREATURE'S BRAIN. THE PLATOON finally reaches the door. RHODES holds it open while his MEN run inside. He holsters his PISTOL and unslings his AUTOMATIC. THE ZOMBIES press towards him. He selects A FEW OF THE CLOSEST ONES, aims, and FIRES, with a look of enjoyment on his face. For a moment he resembles Doc Logan, madness bristling inside him. THE ZOMBIES fall, THEIR HEADS SHATTERED, ONE OF RHODES' MEN calls from inside the doorway. TROOPER Captain...CAPTAIN! RHODES FIRES ANOTHER QUICK BURST, then he turns and moves through the doorway. 141",

MARY moves to fire again but BLUTO grabs her hand. MARY NO...BLUTO...I'M TRYING TO... The dumb creature keeps his grip. MARY has to appease to him. She grasps his hand and shakes vigorously. When he finally lets go, she aims her PISTOL again and FIRES AT THE VEST SEVERAL MORE TIMES. MARY Look. It's good to shoot the circles. Good. Good. THE ZOMBIES are confused. Exasperated, MARY tears off her own vest and tosses it down the alley. THE RED COATS look befuddled, and a little angry. MARY FIRES at the vest she threw down. TWO BULLETS HIT IT before MARY'S PISTOL CLICKS...empty. There's A POUNDING AT THE DOOR. It's RHODES AND HIS TROOP. Suddenly BUB steps into position. WHAP! One of his famous quick draws! BLAM!!! HE FIRES. THE VEST ON THE FLOOR, MARY'S VEST, IS HIT. BUB FIRES AGAIN, the other gun this time. THE VEST ON THE TARGET IS HIT squarely in the center of its orange circle. TONTO now turns. He lifts his PISTOL and FIRES. THE VEST ON THE TARGET IS HIT AGAIN, off center, but hit. MARY THAT'S IT! THAT'S IT! Suddenly THE DOOR AT THE END OF THE RANGE FLIES OPEN. THREE OF RHODES' MEN RUSH IN, wearing, of course, orange circles. THE RED COATS OPEN FIRE. THE TROOPERS ARE CUT TO RIBBONS. Others outside the door duck back behind the walls. THE ZOMBIES lumber toward the open doorway, STILL FIRING AS THEY GO. MARY is backing away through the opposite exit. BUB sees her leaving. He calls to her with a deep, pleading moan. MARY stops and looks at him sadly. He shoots off a military salute. MARY salutes him back. There are tears in her eyes. She turns and hurries off. BUB joins his fellows in pursuit of Rhodes' and his men. 153",

They're CLAWING AT THE FAT-CAT COUNCILLORS, MAULING THEIR WOMEN. GASPARILLA AND TWO OTHER MEN are rolling around crazily, bumping into exercise machines, knocking over wine bottles and tables full of hors-d'oeuvres. The single vest they are fighting over rips apart into two pieces, its orange circle severed into two useless halves. GASPARILLA backs across the floor, his blubber bouncing. He has a tattered piece of the vest clutched in his hands. He tries to spread it out on his chest but it's too late... and THE ZOMBIES are too hungry...much too hungry. MONTAGE: as ALL OVER THE ROOM THEY STRIKE. This is it, gore fans. The gross finale. The intestine-tugger. THE ZOMBIES GET THEIR SUPPER. THEY FEAST AMONG THE PILLOWS, like Romans at an orgy. MUSIC still plays over the gymnasium speakers, rock-a-billy in a gleeful tempo. GASPARILLA has retreated into his tanning-coffin but a pudgy arm and a leg are dangling outside. ZOMBIES CHEW HUNGRILY on the juicy morsels. From inside the coffin, where ultraviolet glows brightly, come the piercing, agonised screams of the fat General. 154",

Then he rushes to SPIDER'S side and scoops her into his arms again. Wincing in pain from THE BLEEDING WOUND IN HIS SHOULDER he manages to move out of immediate danger.

He fights them off valiantly but his super strength is waning. HE IS BITTEN AGAIN AND AGAIN but he tries to keep himself between THE CLUTCHING CREATURES AND THE LITTLE DEAF MUTE who is stumbling along ahead. She's getting very close to a huge SET OF CONCRETE SLABS...THE DOORS TO THE POWDER MAGAZINE. Meanwhile RHODES approaches another corner in the hallway near the Conditioning Room. BUB follows, his boot heels CLICKING the way RHODES' own heels once clicked. RHODES dives for the corner. BUB slaps leather and FIRES OFF ALL TWELVE. RHODES rolls on the ground crazily. HE'S HIT SEVERAL TIMES...but he's still alive. He pulls himself, in agony, out of range. Calmly, BUB dumps out his spent shells and starts to reload. IN THE MAIN CHAMBER, DIESEL IS OVERCOME, DRAGGED DOWN BY A MOB OF ZOMBIES. THEY START TO TEAR HIM APART BIT BY BIT. SPIDER walks on alone. She is just a few feet from the POWDER MAGAZINE now. A ZOMBIE grabs her from behind but just gets a handful of shirt. SPIDER reaches forward but the creature holds her back. Her SHIRT IS RUNNING RIVERS OF BLOOD NOW where the vials are implanted underneath. RHODES crashes through a doorway into THE CONDITIONING ROOM. He realises, too late, that there's no exit. BUB'S BOOTHEELS are getting LOUDER. RHODES crawls around behind THE TABLES FULL OF TESTING EQUIPMENT, WOODEN SHAPES, FLASH CARDS SCATTER. Over near the LARGE COLOURED SYMBOLS which are mounted on the wall there's A WEAPONS CABINET. RHODES grabs a chair and smashes open the glass. BUB steps into the open doorway, still reloading his PISTOLS. He stands there, a golem, his fingers slowly, calmly working. He drops a shell or two but soon the barrels are filled with fresh loads. RHODES reaches in through the broken glass and pulls out AN AUTOMATIC. BUB slaps his PISTOLS back into their HOLSTERS and face off. RHODES lifts the AUTOMATIC...aims... BUB DRAWS! BLAM! BLAM! BLAM! BLAM! BLAM! BLAM! BLAM! BLAM! BLAM! BLAM! BLAM! BLAM! EACH ONE OF THE TWELVE BULLETS HITS RHODES SOMEWHERE, many of them in the \"kill-zones\". He screams when the first few rounds hit, but his screaming stops about halfway through the barrage. That's when he dies. His leg bones support his corpse long enough for the last six bullets to reach him. Then, as THE SOUND OF BUB'S GUN ECHOES AWAY down the corridors, RHODES BODY slides down the wall and crumples to the floor in a heap, leaving MUCH OF HIS BLOOD on the ORANGE CIRCLE that's mounted behind him. IN THE MAIN CHAMBER, A ZOMBIE TAKES A BITE OUT OF SPIDER'S SHOULDER. IT PULLS OUT A BIG CHUNK OF FLESH, AND WITH IT, STUCK IN THE CREATURE'S TEETH, COMES ONE OF THE NITRO VIALS. SEVERAL ZOMBIES are pulling at the woman. She is still reaching for the POWDER MAGAZINE DOORS but the ghouls are pulling her away. THE CREATURE WITH THE TEST TUBE IN ITS MOUTH pulls the bothersome thing out from between its teeth. It studies the vial curiously for a moment, then it tosses it angrily towards SPIDER, toward THE MAGAZINE DOOR... KA-BLOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOM!!! 162",
