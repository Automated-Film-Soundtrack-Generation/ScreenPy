They begin to towel off as Miranda, slowly and painfully self-conscious, begins to undress in the corner. A moment later Irene nods for her to go in. INT. COMMUNAL SHOWERS - LATER Miranda hangs her head under the spray and closes her eyes, trying to shut it all out. The SOUNDS slowly FADE OUT until all we have is Miranda and her RAGGED BREATHING. Chloe and Shelley, the last two out from the previous group, grab towels. Chloe winks at Miranda when she catches her staring, but Miranda is not staring at her. She is staring past her at the tile wall. More specifically at a hole in the tile where a busted water pipe pokes out. Clearly at some point there was a handle there, but now it is just a hole with a busted pipe. PUSH INTO the hole to see a perfectly-formed globule of blood emerge, following by a GURGLING sound which seems to come from deep in the bowels of the plumbing system. The blood lingers tentatively, as if unfamiliar with the laws of gravity, before tracing an upward line along the tile. The GURGLING GROWS LOUDER, CLOSER, and now more blood flows from the hole and spreads up the wall. Miranda looks away, disturbed, and now realizes she is the only one left in the showers. Panic. Shuts her eyes. (CONTINUED)",

Bloodstained axe on floor in f.g. Walls covered with bloodstains. EXT. CHAPEL - DAY Miranda and Doug laugh at their wedding. It's clearly hot, because she wipes sweat off his brow with a handkerchief. INT. MIRANDA AND DOUG'S HOUSE - NIGHT A breathless Miranda wipes her face, leaving a thick streak of blood on it. She looks down at her hand, noticing the blood -- and now we are back in -- INT. MIRANDA'S CELL - NIGHT (PRESENT) Miranda wakes up with a start. The darkness renders the room almost void of any color. Monochromatic. It takes her a moment to orient herself. Her eyes wander across the unfamiliar room, feeling like she's being watched. We become aware of a RAGGED BREATHING sound. Like somebody is standing over her bed. But we don't see anything. Miranda gingerly crosses to the door and peeks through the glass partition into the empty corridor. She glances back at the room, stills seeing nothing -- and bangs on the door. (CONTINUED)",

She looks down the long, empty corridor, the glare of neon lights making her readjust her eyes momentarily. Nobody there. But when she looks down the other way she sees a pair of bare feet disappear behind the wall. So quick we're not sure we saw it for sure. Miranda deliberately walks in the opposite direction. At night the clinical corridor takes on an unsettling quality. She silently strolls down the hall, tilting her head at the various sounds from PATIENTS in their cells. She turns to make sure Rachel isn't behind her and when Miranda faces forward again, she realizes she is standing right across from: THE NURSES' STATION Where two nurses are watching TELEVISION. Miranda tiptoes past them, ducking at the window to remain unseen. ANOTHER CORRIDOR This one is wider. Miranda is startled by the sudden sound of LAUGHTER behind her. The nurses laughing at their late night show. Momentarily distracted, she almost knocks over a mop and bucket resting by the wall. She holds the mop in place and now opens the door to a SANITATION CLOSET. (CONTINUED)",

THE STAIRS Miranda hurries up the stairs, hugging the wall to stay clear from the SURVEILLANCE CAMERA sweeping the area. She waits at the landing, times it just right -- and scurries to the next floor. INT. WOODWARD CORRIDOR (OFFICE FLOOR) - CONTINUOUS ACTION Knowing her way around here, Miranda keeps a steady pace as she heads towards her old office. She turns a corner and stops in her tracks: another JANITOR making his rounds. She waits until he's out of sight and rushes to her office. She pulls out the stolen screwdriver and brings it to the lock. Starts unscrewing the screws. She does this as fast as she can, but she's no professional -- so it takes a few tries. She loosens one screw, then another -- and clumsily drops the screwdriver. The METAL ECHOES against the floor. Miranda sucks her breath in, waits. No footsteps. She bends down, retrieves it, and holds onto the knob for balance. It easily turns in her hand. It was open all along. She simply forgot to check. INT. MIRANDA'S OFFICE Miranda shuts the door behind her and slips behind her computer. Shrouded in darkness. Hits a switch and a SURVEILLANCE MONITOR comes to life. Now she has a view of the corridors: two guards here, a nurse going for a smoke, a janitor at the coffee machine and so on. She switches on her computer and taps her fingers as she waits for it to boot up. ON SURVEILLANCE MONITOR The JANITOR with his coffee cup now heading back towards Miranda's office corridor -- (CONTINUED) 54. CONTINUED: Miranda glances at the door, can see the glare of the computer screen reflecting against the glass pane. She tries opening drawers but they're all locked. She remembers something and digs a sweatshirt from beneath the couch, uses it to block the light. Computer powered up, she runs an online search for \"RACHEL PARSONS.\" Waits as the info appears -- MIRANDA (to self) Alright. What happened to you? ON COMPUTER SCREEN Various listings: The archive news of her funeral, something about her search and a LOCAL NEWS ARTICLE about teen suicide. That's the one she chooses. Hits \"PRINT.\" She checks the surveillance monitor again:     the janitor now mops right outside her door. ON PRINTOUT The heading says \"WHAT DRIVES OUR TEENAGERS TO SUICIDE?\" A quick glimpse gives us ages (16, 18, 17) and names of three local girls who have died. Rachel's name and PHOTOGRAPH appears with two others: Jenny Dixon and Andrea White. Miranda pockets it, looks back at the surveillance monitor: the janitor is walking away. She watches him disappear down the hall. Slowly but surely. And now the screen is empty. But just for a second. Because suddenly Rachel is there. Staring straight at her. Makes us jump. INT. CORRIDOR/STAIRS - MOMENTS LATER Retracing her steps, Miranda shuts her door and hits the stairs. Playing off the sweep of the surveillance camera. INT. FEMALE WARD CORRIDOR - CONTINUOUS ACTION As she reaches the landing, she hears VOICES coming her way. She detours down another corridor and hides from view. Waits for Consuelo and a nurse to exit down the staircase. (CONTINUED) 55. CONTINUED: And now she turns at ANOTHER SOUND. Coming from inside the room immediately behind her. Room 237. She steps to the small glass pane on the door and peers inside. INT. ROOM 237 It takes a moment to adjust our eyes to the darkness but now we make out TWO FIGURES in the room involved in some sort of struggle. Miranda presses her face against the glass and now sees a flash of metal. Something sharp. Not a knife, but a needle. And now a blur of hair yanked up by a strong arm. In the dim light we can make out Chloe, eyes glazed, drooling. Just for a beat, because now she is slapped down on the bed like a rag doll and the man with the needle ENTERS FRAME. INT. CORRIDOR - CONTINUOUS ACTION Miranda flinches, confused. Glances down the corridor to ensure she remains undiscovered. Then peers back in. INT. ROOM 237 Chloe on her stomach on the bed. Her pale naked skin marked with scratches and bruises. The needle is stuck in her arm, which hangs off the side. Her mouth is open but it is impossible to tell whether she is laughing or sobbing. Abruptly the man climbs on her, pulling off his T-shirt. As he discards it we see that it is yellow. INT. CORRIDOR - CONTINUOUS ACTION Disturbed, Miranda turns away. Except now the corridor isn't empty. There is a JANITOR at the end. Coffee cup in hand. Staring at her, disconcerted.",

CONTINUED: And here, where the walls should meet, there is a narrow gap, leading to a passage, maybe five inches wide. A padlocked chain has been threaded through a hole in both walls, holding them together. Miranda inspects the heavy padlock, the source of the glint. She tugs on the wall and opens it to the limits of the chain, but that's only a few inches more. Miranda peers into the darkness beyond, but can't see a thing. Hesitating only a moment, she turns sideways and slides herself into the claustrophobic slot. She moves forward cautiously a few feet until her face brushes against something hanging in the air.

SURVEILLANCE BOOTH - NIGHT A bank of monitors keep watch on the premises   after dark. TWO GUARDS play cards (Uno), bored to tears.    A cursory glance at the monitors produces no reaction.    Certainly a janitor walking down the corridor is no cause   for alarm. EXT. PARKING LOT - NIGHT Dead quiet. CRICKETS CHIRP or whatever it is    crickets do. Miranda steadies her breathing, perusing    rows of unfamiliar cars. She clicks Simon's key-ring    button repeatedly until a set of headlights blink on   and off. INT. SIMON'S CAR - NIGHT Miranda slips behind the wheel, STARTS the CAR. The RADIO KICKS IN at EAR-DEAFENING VOLUME. She nearly drops dead. EXT. WOODWARD GATE - NIGHT The gate GUARD reads a magazine as Miranda's stolen car approaches. The guard barely registers the driver in the booth mirror, immersed in his article. Hits a button to open the gate for him. It opens SLOWLY. S-l-o-w-l-y.",
