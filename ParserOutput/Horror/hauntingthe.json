And then out of the tangled forest in front of her looms a pair of immense stone pillars.  Between them, a steel GATE as high as the wall, chained and padlocked. EXT. HILL HOUSE GATE - DAY The gate stands immense.  Silent.  Forbidding.  Beyond them a gravel drive curves away through the trees.  Nell kills her car, gets out, instructions in hand.  No one in sight.  A long beat. She reaches in and blows the HORN. The HORN shatters the air, rackets off the trees beyond the gate, echoing.  Silence. Nell blows the HORN a sustained staccato in annoyance.  The echo replies in a terrible, deafening battering of sound.  Nell covers her ears.  Silence once again. In a fit of agitation she goes to the padlock and rattles it.  It's locked good.  She turns -- -- and there is a man right behind her.  It is MR. DUDLEY , his hair tied back like an ex-hippie.  He stands between Nell and her open car door, weed spear in hand.  He smiles at her -- rough, dirty, massive.",

She draws the covers about her and peers up at the ornate headboard. Something about it bothers Nell, but she can't put her finger on it. She twists over on her side and turns out the light on the nightstand. For a moment, all there is in the darkness is her breathing -- INT. GREAT HALL - NIGHT -- then almost silence.

Awaiting something.  Afraid. At the end of the hallway, where all eyes are staring, the double doors, the ones that scared Nell and Theo stand shut.

The shape of the little girl's face now travels underneath the bedsheets toward the pillows, toward Nell. Nell turns, restless, the AIR catches the edge of the pillowcase, and travels towards Nell's face.  And for a split second there is a lifelike IMPRESSION OF A SMALL GIRL'S FACE.  Nell almost awakens.

Her motions are languid in the light of the single small lamp, off-balance with the wine. Her HAIR brushes out in long, even strokes.  The brush moves through it, lifting it and letting it fall. IN THE MIRROR the brush draws through Nell's hair, but as it does, the hair divides in its wake LIKE FINGERS RUNNING THROUGH it. Nell freezes.  She's not sure what she just saw.  She runs the brush through again, and again it is as if something pulls it back from her head. Again -- fast -- she runs the brush through her hair, and this time the hair SPINS UP IN A KNOT. Nell flinches, dropping the brush, knocking the shade of the lamp on the vanity a-wobbling. She's out of the chair in a flash, grabbing her own hair, staring at the space behind her.  Nothing there.  A beat. She steadies herself, feeling the alcohol.  Gets control. The Tiffany lamp rocks back and forth, crystal beads shimmering. The light plays across the fireplace and mantle on the wall.  And something there catches her eye. Nell feels her way across the room, not sure of what she's seeing. Over the sound of the wind outside, there's something at the very highest edge of hearing. She stops five feet from the mantle.  The swaying light catches the rich tones of wood.  Then darkens.  Illuminates it again.  Darkens. The carvings of the playing CHILDREN in the wood SEEM TO MOVE. Nell stares in drunken fascination.  And as the first fear begins to rise in her throat, the wind dies down and in its place there is the FAINTEST TRACE OF CHILDREN'S LAUGHTER.  Nell's reaction changes... to awe. Tentative, her hand goes out, shaking... and touches the mantle. It is hard and still.  No movement whatsoever.  Silence.  But the FACES engraved in the wood all seem to be peering up at her, hands outstretched for her, hopeful. EXT. HILL HOUSE GATES - NIGHT The enormous LOCKED gates are silhouetted against the moonlit sky. The chain is dangling in the wind. EXT. HILL HOUSE - NIGHT Hold on Nell's WINDOW, the light shining dim through the gauze curtain.  It goes out.  The window stares from an arrangement of other windows, stonework and doors... like an eye with a cataract in a face howling in horror. INT. NELL'S ROOM - NIGHT Nell, her breathing heavy, lies tangled in her heavy blankets, asleep, but restless.  Her feet hang off the end of the bed. In the b.g., the door to the bathroom is shut, barely visible in the faint light from the window.  HOLD on it. Silently, it begins to OPEN.  The gap WIDENS, yawning, pitch dark beyond.  A long beat.  And then a THUMP.  A SLIDING SOUND. Something drags itself across the floor. BUMP.  SLIDE.  Our line of sight is blocked by the bed.  But the sound is getting louder, coming closer. Bump.  Slide.  Nell grinds her teeth in her sleep, pulls the blankets about her tighter.  Bump.  The sound stops.  And her BREATH BEGINS TO FOG. Whatever has just come in the room is right there, hovering just OC. We can feel it. Without warning Nell BOLTS upright, GASPING into consciousness. REVEAL: nothing.  Just the dark room.  And the bathroom door OPEN. Nell stares at the-door, knows she shut it.  Now it's open.  She breaths fast, feeling the cold, knowing something's in here with her. She stops breathing, strains her ears.  Silence.  A long moment. Then she notices her feet, hanging out from under the covers. They are black.  Feel slick.  Nell turns on the light by her bed and looks down. HER FEET ARE COVERED IN GORE.  Where Theo had been painting.  Nell SCREAMS. INT. NELL'S BATHROOM - NIGHT SCREAMING, Nell spins the tub faucets on full blast, sticks her feet into the spray.",

Nell hovers over it, holding her breath so as not to make the book flip over and fall off the shelf in one instant. SLIP.  Another page turns.  The book is a PHOTO ALBUM of the late nineteenth century, bound with ribbons, the aged Daguerreotypes in pressed vellum frames. Nell peers closer.  It's open to a faded, gray image taken long before it became the convention to smile for a photograph: a woman, RENE CRAIN, sitting in a chair. And standing behind the chair, a fearsome presence in a black coat, his face hollow, malevolent.  HUGH CRAIN. Nell shivers, and SLIP, the page turns on its own. An image of Hugh and Rene, a look of deathly loss on their faces. The page flips. Crain hovers, dark, rage just under the surface, but on Rene's face is the faintest, most inappropriate SMILE.  It sends a chill through Nell. The album begins to slide down the shelf, and as it does, PAGES FLIP, Rene's SMILE grows wider, her hair dishevelled, her eyes lit with grinning insanity... Nell grabs the book just as it falls from the shelf. It is open in her hands to a picture of Crain, alone, in front of the enormous fireplace in the Great Hall.  RENE IS GONE.  The photo is monstrous.  Nell, fearful, turns the page -- -- and REACTS to the last thing she expected.  A picture of a lovely woman filled with grace and power.  CAROLYN CRAIN.  Posed.

Her hand seems to be POINTING at the gaping maw of the GRAND FIREPLACE. Nell bolts from the room. INT. GREAT HALL - DAY Nell bursts into the Great Hall and stops.  At the far end of the room broods the vast fireplace, its chain curtains hanging like the veil to some hellish sanctuary. Nell stares at it, daunted.  What is it that Carolyn is trying to show her?  The fireplace beckons, and Nell approaches against her will. She finds a steel poker hanging by the fireplace, and takes it down. She uses it to slide one of the chain curtains open.  She steps into its soot-black mouth. Nell peers up the chimney.  A faint sigh of air.  She sticks the poker up the flue, scratches around.  Nothing. She turns her attention to the back of the fireplace, thwocks it. Sooty stone chips away, but it's solid. The mechanism for the ash drop catches her eye.  Nell grabs the heavy, iron lever.  She pulls, but can barely budge it.  It finally screeches back, and the iron door in the floor of the fireplace SWINGS DOWN. Nell looks in.  Two feet down it looks like a gray blanket of ash, a charred timber or two sticking out.  Sick with fear, Nell prods the ash.  Just charred wood. She thrusts the poker down deep.  It vanishes in the ash up to her hand.  CLACK.  She rakes through the ash.  CLACK.  And then she feels the poker take purchase.  She draws it out, and full of dread turns it to the light... Impaled on its hooks are TWO HUMAN SKULLS. Nell fights back the scream in her throat.  One of the skulls is a child's skull, the other an IMMENSE SKULL with brooding brow, forehead crushed. Nell lets the poker drop.  It bangs off the door, falls in the ash drop, its handle hitting a spring.  Nell recoils as the trapdoors SNAP SHUT like a pair of jaws. INT.

The hallways peel past Nell as she runs, slamming through doors, ever darker.  The House's hellish carvings glare as she passes, grinning, taunting.  She rages on, oblivious until she rounds a final corner -- INT. HALLWAY OUTSIDE LOCKED ROOM - NIGHT -- into the long, dark hall leading to the LOCKED ROOM.  The STATUARY peer down on her.

Luke settles back against the wall. The HOUSE EXHALES, and the breath of the house is like the poppy field in the Wizard of OZ; it brings on sleep. INT.

NELL'S ROOM - NIGHT Nell lies asleep, the ornate headboard looming behind her, black with its strange plant-like splay of leaves. Nell draws a deep, sleeping breath... and her EYES OPEN.  She lies there, her breath still in her lungs, not moving, but sensing something.  A long beat.  When she lets her breath out, we can see it in the cold. INT. NELL'S BATHROOM - NIGHT Luke's head rests solidly on the wall.  His eyes are closed, unaware his breath is fogging too. INT. NELL'S ROOM - NIGHT Nell lies there afraid to move, afraid to make the faintest sound. From the darkness above WOOD CREAKS.  At first it seems like someone is walking on the floor above.  But it is coming from within the room. The CARVINGS on the ceiling, the impossibly elaborate woodwork, ARE MOVING.  Incredibly slowly, with incredible subtlety: turning inside out, some of the forms lengthening, some shortening.  Carvings changing here, changing there -- the ceiling coming alive -- with some grand design we sense but cannot yet see. The wood grows out of the ceiling eating its way down into the tall bed POSTERS.  It crawls down the posters, straining the sinewy baroque curves, swelling them... The CREAKING begins from the darkness of the wall opposite Nell. Nell inclines her head to see.  Out of the wall two enormous BULGES grow, side by side. From behind Nell, now.  The headboard GROANS, its shapes moving, the fan-like plant designs thickening and SPLAYING wide. Nell can't move, her mind refusing to understand what's going on. The bulges in the wall DROOP to the floor.  And then we BEGIN TO SEE: they are like a pair of KNEES. Understanding starts to show in Nell's eyes.  She looks up at the ceiling.  And now all the movement, the design behind the awful transformation of the ceiling is clear. It is a HEAD.  A visage of madness, of absolute horror, eyelids sealing shut its blind face. Silence.  Nell's breath comes ragged.  Unable to speak, but trying to call out. The EYES OPEN.  A SCREAM tears out of Nell's throat. INT.

No answer, and as she steps forward, listening for a reply, the CURTAIN BILLOWS OUT behind her, and in its movement, becomes for a split second, the image of CRAIN, GRABBING for her. Nell, oblivious, steps just OUT OF REACH, and as the breeze fails, the contours and patterns of the billowing curtain dissolve into chaos.  Nell glances back at it, just sees curtain, and looks up at the open window. She turns from it, determined, and starts out to find her friends and walks down the steps. INT. GRAND STAIRCASE/GREAT HALL - NIGHT CLOSE ON THE BRASS GRIFFINS that guard the staircase. Behind Nell's back they all turn toward her, follow her with their eyes as Nell enters the great hall.  And they cower in fear for what is about to happen.  Again Nell call's out for Theo and Marrow. And Nell doesn't see the scores of TINY ARMS OF CHILDREN that fold out from the carvings in the high backed chairs in the hall as Nell carefully avoids stepping on the skulls and bones of the children that cover the floor. Horrifyingly alive are these TINY HANDS as reach out for her hair after she passes.  We're screaming as they almost have her... and Nell steps away. And then... CREAK... CREAK... CREAK... The terrified animal heads on the balustrade, their eyes flash in fear.  The lions above the big fireplace snarl restlessly. Cherubim, afraid, clasp hands.  Gods and men pay unwilling witness to what is now coming down the stairs. The upper flight of stairs strains under the weight of the thing coming down, over our heads, coming down, down... and now at the landing.  The sound stops. Nell's BREATH escapes, visible in the cold as she watches, rooted to the floor in the Grand Entry. Darkness against darkness.  Something BLOCKS the glint of the gilded frame up on the landing.  Something huge.  A beat. And then a SHADOW sweeps across the scene, impenetrable, darkening the stairs, wiping them from sight, like something gliding down them. Before our eyes, out of the most subtle variation of shadow, flickers into existence: THE SHAPE, tall, eight or nine feet, featureless, black, but in the proportions of an enormous man with his head bowed, shoulders stooped.  And just like that, all it is... ...is a well of darkness and night once again.  We don't even know for sure what we just saw.  But it is still there in that bar of shadow. Nell goes rigid, not breathing, not seeing anything but the awful presence.  She is spellbound. BANG.  A door in the connecting passage opens, and Theo and Marrow come out, between Nell in the entry and the thing in the Great Hall beyond. In a flash the SHAPE is moving at Theo and Marrow.  They don't see it, have their backs turned.",

PSYCH OBSERVATION LAB - DAY The lab feels more like the video center of a security office than a psychologist's laboratory.  Two banks of black and white monitors give us images of men and women, different ages, different races, wired to electrodes.  They are taking psychological tests, although we never see the Testers.  The subjects are working through variations on object manipulation and pattern recognition tests. There are subtle differences between the two banks of monitors.  On the left, the subjects are all twitching at exactly the same time, on the right, the subjects are also twitching, but in no discernible sequence.  The subjects on the left are better able to concentrate on their tasks.  The subjects on the right keep stopping, and going over what they have done. Two men, MALCOLM KEOGH , in his 50's, is a graying professor, the head of the department; someone we trust. He faces PROFESSOR JAMES MARROW .  He is a man whose confidence rests uneasily on his ambition, and in the tension between the two is the power that makes him the teacher students love.  Right now, though, he is defending himself before a Department Review.  This is not a court martial with judges behind a desk, it's more free form. The men are having a fight, and they are watched by OTHER PROFESSORS.",
