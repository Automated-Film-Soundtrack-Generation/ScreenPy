Breathing quickening he reaches up to the black silk sheet covering her head. He yanks it back and covers his mouth in horror. She's been bound to the bed and gagged with a white cloth that is soaked with blood. A deep vertical incision has been made in her neck, collarbone to chin and her tongue is pulled through the wound so it sticks out the bottom of her jaw. And that's just for starters. When Trevor looks down he gags when he sees her ribcage has been opened like a set of French doors and her insides sitting in her lap. The coup de grace? Trevor now sees he is covered with blood.
