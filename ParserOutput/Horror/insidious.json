It pops free, shooting across the room like a kernel of popcorn...followed by another tack. The second tack lands in Josh's lap. Puzzled, he picks it up, examining it. He looks up, his eye drawn to the picture on the wall. With total astonishment, he sees the two remaining tacks works themselves free, popping out of the wall. The drawing floats down to the ground. Josh stoops down, picking it up. It is a drawing split into two halves. The left half is a self portrait of Dalton, lying in bed, looking down from above. The right half is a depiction of outer space - squiggly stars and bloated planets. Dalton has drawn another version of himself on this side, flying above the house with another man. At the bottom of the first drawing, Dalton has written `Last night I watched myself sleep'. A tear falls down Josh's face. He begins to cry. Deep and painful tears he has long pent up. Beneath the second drawing, Dalton has written `Then I flew away.'",

Dalton stares at them...not a trace of emotion on his face. Then he reaches up and grips his bottom jaw with both hands, wrenching it downwards with almighty force and BREAKING HIS OWN JAW. Renai SCREAMS into the abyss as Dalton BELLOWS at them, spit flying from his throat, his tongue hanging down over his dislocated jaw. He stamps his foot and the table - and everyone sitting at it, Renai, Josh and Elise - go flying backwards as if pushed by a hurricane, smashing into the wall with crushing power. We realize that Dalton was not sitting at the table, but squatting down awkwardly. Painfully. He stands up, then steps forward. As Josh and Renai watch, his KNEE begins to BEND BACKWARDS, the tendons stretching and snapping, the knee bending in the opposite direction. His other knee follows and he steps forward - both knees bending back. Specs is rigid in his chair, rooted to the spot, notepad still in hand. When he looks up at Dalton, the flashlight under his chin shines in Dalton's eyes. Dalton ROARS and advances forward - SLAPPING Specs with the force of ten men. Specs reels backwards, hitting the wall, smashing his head and crumpling like paper. Elise stands to face Dalton. The CAMERA FLASH goes off again, lighting the darkened room for a split second and showing Elise the lipstick-smeared face of a demon instead of Dalton's face. Tucker SHRINKS BACK as he captures all this with the video camera. Dalton steps forward again and Elise CHARGES at him, grabbing Dalton by the hair.",
