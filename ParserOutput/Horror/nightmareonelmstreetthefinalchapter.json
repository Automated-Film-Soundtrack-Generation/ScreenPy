GINA'S BEDROOM - NIGHT Gina sits on her bed in her night clothes.  She holds a deck of cards in one hand while she plays solitaire on her bed sheets. She flips a card from her deck: A black nine.  She puts it on top of a ten.  Another card.  Queen of diamonds.  She lays it on top of a king of clubs.  Gina yawns.  Takes another card. It's the Freddy of Spades. Gina frowns.  Freddy Krueger's image stares up at her from the card.  She looks at her stacks.  There's no place to put this one.  She starts flipping through the deck of cards, trying to see if there are any more Freddys.  That's when a HAND RIPS UP through the bed and grabs her arm. Gina SCREAMS, pulls away from the hand's grip and jumps back up on the bed.  And ANOTHER HAND shoots up from a pillow and grabs her shoulder.  Gina twists. RIP.  TEAR.  GRAB.  More hands appear out of the mattress, lunging for any part of Gina's body as she SHRIEKS from their touch.  And Gina jumps out of bed. She leaps to the other side of the room, bumping against her dresser drawers.  Turns to her bed. SWOOP.  The multiple hands disappear down into the mattress. There is a quiet beat as she catches her shivering breath. Then a half-dozen ARMS AND HANDS pop out from the drawers next to her.  Latching indiscriminately.  Some grabbing her legs and arms.  Some grabbing more intimate parts. Gina SCREAMS.  Pulls away from the dresser.  Yanks a few drawers out as the hands vanish and she spins over to another wall. Where the wall ERUPTS with outreaching arms all around her. Two grab her hair.  Three on each arm.  Her legs are pinned. Gina shrieks and yells and flays her arms.  Beating the hands with her fists as two grabs her breasts viciously.  She starts kicking as one particularly perverse hand BURNT AND SCARRED, pops out between her legs.  Aiming right for her crotch and in an incredible show of strength, the girl pulls away from the horde. Gina heads for the door.  CRASH.  Hands blast up from the wood floor.  She leaps around them.  CRASH.  More hands try to block her way. Gina jumps around like she's in a mine field made of hot coals.  She finally reaches to door and flings it open. INT.

Sound Cop's headless body walks into the shot, his arms held ABOVE FRAME over his neck. Then Sound Cop's arms lower his dismembered HEAD onto his stump, push it down, twist it til it stays.  With great effort, Sound Cop yanks the brick out of his mouth. Jacob now looks OFF SCREEN at something else, something that REALLY makes his eyes widen.

Another one underneath it.  And another.  It's as if people moved in and out and instead of changing the plates on the mailbox, they just whacked a new one over the old.  Karen steps closer to the mailbox. The little sign on the top reads WILLIAMS.  She touches it with her finger and it drops off, the nails holding it on rusted away to dust.  A new plate is revealed.  This one says THOMPSON. Karen picks lightly at it, and it swings away.  The name underneath makes Karen gasp. It reads KRUEGER. And there's still another one under that horrible name. Karen quickly hits the Krueger plate off.  The last sign reads UNDERWOOD. Karen frowns.  She turns back to the house, a determined expression on her face.",

ELM STREET HOUSE - LIVING ROOM Karen races through, pulling open desk drawers, rifling through shelves, flipping through books.  She doesn't know what she's looking for, but she knows she hasn't found it yet. INT. ELM STREET HOUSE - KITCHEN The intensity of Karen's quest increases as she yanks open cabinets and tosses plates to the floor.  Still nothing. INT. ELM STREET HOUSE - STAIRS Karen runs up them, a girl with a mission. INT. ELM STREET HOUSE - MASTER BEDROOM Karen flings the door open.  Nothing but a bed and a set of drawers.  No hint as to the occupant's lives.  She doesn't bother ransacking this one and goes on to: INT. ELM STREET HOUSE - FREDDY'S BEDROOM Jackpot.  Karen stares through the open door at a child's room, a very twisted child's room.  She slowly walks in. A bed, a desk, a dresser.  There's a Jack-in-a-box with its head torn off.  A disemboweled Teddy Bear.  White puffy guts hanging out of it.  A clown doll with its face caved in.  A hanging mobile made of strange bent shapes. And a pile of more-than-dirty clothes. Karen goes over to the pile and picks through it with her toe.  A small pair of pants, about the right size for an eight-year-old.  A black pair of shoes.  And a little sweater, a RED AND GREEN STRIPED sweater. Karen goes over to the desk.  There is stack of drawings on it - a child's drawings.  On one of them it looks like someone was practicing writing their name.  FREDDY UNNERWOOD, FREDDY UNDERWUD, FREDDY UNDERWOOD over and over again.  Until the final attempt has the last name angrily crossed out, replaced underneath by a hastily scrawled KRUEGER!!! Another piece of paper: a set of human stick figures.  A small one is labeled FREDDY.  The large one is labeled DADDY. The Daddy figure is depicted HITTING the Freddy figure. There are more drawings, all of them violent, the large figure beating away at the small one. Suddenly a CREAKING.  Karen jumps.  Hides behind a bookshelf. She's nervously trying to figure out what to do when a framed picture catches her attention on the shelf.  It's a picture of a tall, dark man and a little boy.  Karen reaches out to grab the picture, but accidentally knocks over a glass mug with a CRASH. FOOTSTEPS can now be heard tromping up the stairs. Someone's coming and Karen's on the edge of panic.  She looks around and finds an old baseball bat.  She grabs it and runs to the side of the doorway as the FOOTSTEPS approach down the hallway.  Karen raises the bat. And Jacob appears.  Karen pulls back with the bat as Jacob jumps away from her.",

ANGLE ON KAREN Her mouth drops open at what she's just seen.  What she DOESN'T see is the white cloud swooping down the street behind her. She just closes her eyes as the ivory mist envelops her and the SCREEN GOES WHITE. FADE IN FROM WHITE TO: EXT. PARK BENCH - DAY Karen lies sleeping on the bench amongst the grass and trees. Her eyes open and squint at the bright light.  She sits up and tries to get her bearings.  Some hair falls into her face and she brushes it away.  Only then noticing that she's holding something in her hand. She opens her hand and looks down. KAREN'S POV It's an ID bracelet.  A band of gold with a larger plate dangling from the middle of it.  Karen's hand turns it over. This time the printing reads JACOB. WITH KAREN she chokes back the tears.  We hear a PANTING O.S.  Then a woman's voice.",
