As he searches, he can't help but notice the heartfelt epitaphs. On the outer circle, he sees a crate-board marker memorializing: SMUCKY THE CAT... HE WAS OBEDIANT. MOVING INWARD, the markers are older. The ones he can still read convey a sense of the perpetual cycle of life and death. Here is a wide, flat, upright board planted deep in the earth: \"In Memory of MARTA our Pet Rabit Dyed March 1 1965.\" The next three rows are illegible, the inscriptions are weathered beyond recognition... And then, chiseled into sandstone: HANNAH THE BEST DOG THAT EVER LIVED 1929-1939. And now... \"MEOW.\" Faint. But very much alive. Geoff picks up his pace, weaving quickly toward the center.

Geoff grabs hold of the axe handle, struggling, and the two boys go down... RENEE Moves to the vanity. She sweeps a hand across it, sending everything crashing to the ground. Crystal perfume bottles SHATTER, spilling their contents over the floor. Renee reaches for a lighter and flicks it on. She touches the flame to the perfume-soaked floor... FLAMES roar into existence, racing across the floorboards, igniting the curtains... We see the flames reflected in Renee's soulless eyes. ON GEOFF AND CLYDE As they wrestle with one another across the floor. Bloody spittle drips from Clyde's face. He flashes a feral snarl. Clyde LUNGES forward and tears into Geoff's shoulder with his teeth... Geoff SCREAMS. His hands grope blindly for a weapon and close on a mirror shard. He JABS it up and into Clyde's eye... Somehow, Geoff manages to roll out from under Clyde. He rises to his feet... Clyde lets loose a DEMONIC ROAR. He charges, SLASHING the axe wildly, knocking aside curtains and dressing models alike. Nothing's going to stop him. Nothing. Flames are consuming the attic, licking the rafters, igniting the canopy drapings... devouring everything. SMOKE is rolling across the floor... Geoff reaches a far wall. He's trapped in a corner. There's nowhere else to go. Behind Geoff is a CIRCUIT BOX. INSULATED CABLES run from the box down through the attic floor. Geoff turns...
