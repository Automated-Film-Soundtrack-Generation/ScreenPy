A huge antique bed sits in the room's center, and on it... Lestat lays feverish and fitful, dressed in a soft linen nightshirt. His neck wears a swollen bite. Another flash of lightning suddenly jolts him awake. His hands feel the inflamed wound as he sees... An indistinct shape of a man dressed in draping red velvet, sitting asleep in a chair across the room. An easel stands before him, holding an unseen painting. Lestat rises out of the bed and grabs his clothes from a nearby Louis IV chair. He makes for a door when... Lestat suddenly stops. He looks back to see the painting that stands on the easel. It's a portrait of himself in ancient Roman garb, like the god Mars, complete with his blond hair and fiery blue eyes. Unable to help himself, he approaches the painting, completely fascinated by his own image, when suddenly... The sleeping man leaps up, grabs   Lestat unmercifully and again plunges his teeth into the   young man's neck. Lestat fights as best he can but   his strength is no match as he's slowly drawn down to the   floor. Finally... The strange man lifts himself up from Lestat's neck to reveal the face of the vampire MARIUS, the mysterious figure. Wiping his blooded mouth on his painter's cloth -- MARIUS Lestat.    Welcome.

Figures moving through the fog. Jesse moves slowly along a wall in the shadows trying to get a better look... Suddenly, out of the shadows, a BOTTLE SMASHES... She starts, quickens her pace... Runs straight into a bulky figure. A primal scream rises from her stomach. The figure is a homeless drunk, more scared than she is, who scuttles off quickly into the night.

The bar is comprised of elaborately-carved Chinese dragons, a TV mounted incongruously in the corner showing a silent Vampire Lestat video. Couples dance cheek to cheek, rotating like figures on a music box. Another couple is necking hot and heavy in the corner. Jesse stares at the patrons of this vampire coven.

Suddenly, the sconces along the passageway come to life... In quick succession, they flare up and burn with an unnatural intensity. Lestat, struck with curiosity and wonder, puts down his candelabra and ventures forth. We FOLLOW Lestat as he rounds the corner and stops. There is an open foyer area leading to two great wooden doors, held firm by a tree-sized carved wooden bolt that bars the doors shut from the outside. Suddenly, the BOLT flies up and SPLINTERS with a SHRIEKING CRACK. The doors fly open revealing a bright light from within... Lestat, apprehensive, continues towards the open doorway. 86   INT.

We recognize Akasha from the sketches in Talbot's office. Stepping closer, they appear not to be statues at all but rather alabaster humans with the palest skin imaginable.

The song of the VIOLIN ECHOES around the walls... Lestat plays, with increasing abandon... Akasha and Enkil sit frozen... Lestat plays and plays, lost in the music.   He throws a glance up at the throne and stops... Akasha is moving... Slowly, her eyelids pull back to reveal pale green eyes. Lestat stares in amazement... Her arm rises up, her wrist extended outward towards Lestat. The pulse of a HEARTBEAT begins... Lestat moves toward her as if beckoned. A green vein appears beneath the marble surface of her skin. The vein pulses as the blood courses around. The HEARTBEAT POUNDS LOUDER, DEEPER. The sound fills Lestat's head as he is drawn closer to Akasha's wrist.

The girl and Father smile, nod to him as they play. Marius, in the shadows, is fuming. Lestat's eyes fill with the moment, the girl's vitality. He notices that sitting on the ground by the girl are several instruments. Impulsively, he reaches over, picks up a violin. He studies the girl's playing again, then with his new powers, as if by osmosis... Begins to play with exactly her skill, exactly her movements. The girl and her Father laugh, delighted with this new musician. Lestat plays along with them, joyful, exhilarated. The girl's fingers fly. Lestat's fingers pick up speed. Faster. Faster. A glittering torrent of notes fly out of his violin as if made of gold. Unconsciously, Lestat steps closer to the music, into firelight. The Father and his daughter become less certain, as they gaze at Lestat's strange, pale, glowing skin, the luminous shine of eyes. But Lestat is completely taken by the music, the moment. The Father and the daughter, sensing something strange, stop playing. Lestat looks up. Sees terror in their eyes. The Father is slowly backing away, pointing in horror at Lestat.",
