Ample cleavage. ANGELINA TYLER: 20. Extremely nadve looking. She won her part in STAB 3 playing Sidney through a phone in radio contest. She's timid, with short dark hair. Out of the entire cast, she is the closet to Sidney, they got. And also the loveable TYSON JACKSON: late 20's, African-American, all attitude.

She knows this actress and doesn't really want to be in her company very long. Gale Shit. Jennifer Listen, I know we've never met, and I don't mind you never returning my calls, but I have to tell you that after two films I feel like I am in your mind. Gale Well, that would explain my constant headaches. Jennifer (defensively) You know I'm sorry that things didn't work out on '60 Minutes II', but 'Total Entertainment' that's a pretty good fall back. Gale Thank you.  I'm sorry that things didn't work out with Brad Pitt, but being single, that's a pretty good fall back. Jennifer Gives me more time for my work. After all, Gale Weathers, you're such a complex character. Gale And to be played by an actress with such depth and range. Dewey steps back into the picture, cell phone in hand.
