This is Tarker's Mills, and in places like this, time moves more slowly. Cars - not too many - move back and forth. No one is in a hurry. We see the Methodist church (and the parsonage next door); Andy's Sporting Goods; Owen's Pub, with its Narragansett neon sign. We see a barber shop with a striped pole; we see the Holy Family Catholic Church and the rectory next door. We see the Gem Theater, which is showing a revival of Sophia Loren in \"Two Women.\" It's Our Town, U.S.A.",

A PRETTY CHINA DISH, CU A whole bunch of capsules are dumped into it. THE CAMERA DRAWS BACK to show us STELLA, sitting by her vanity mirror. The rest of the room is reflected in the mirror, including the window - we are upstairs. [NOTE: It would be nice to see that fat moon floating in the window!] There's a framed picture of STELLA's ex-boyfriend on the vanity beside the dish of pills. STELLA sets down the empty prescription bottle the pills came from beside this picture. We can clearly read the word \"Nembutol\" on it. There is also a large glass of water on the vanity table. STELLA turns the picture facedown. She might be crying but probably she's not. She takes about five of the pills, starts to lift them to her mouth- A HOWL outside... closer. STELLA looks around for a moment, then takes the pills with some water. She pauses, looking at herself.",

SOUND: The bell rings. A beat or two, then the doors bang wide and a billion kids spill out. It's the end of the first day of school, and they are excited. They range from Grade 1 to Grade 8. Most kids book it for home as fast as they can, getting on their bikes and riding or just running. Everyone has a pink report card. EXT.  A BUNCH OF KIDS, WITH BRADY KINCAID AND TAMMY STURMFULLER BRADY and TAMMY are riding bikes. Now there is the SOUND of a gasoline engine, and MARTY catches up. He's got the Silver Bullet's motor running for the first time in the movie. Later on it will sound extremely powerful, like a racing car, but now it just sounds like a big lawnmower engine with a muffler on it. It's pretty cool, though - a bright metallic silver with flame decals on the motor housing. Looks sort of like something Big Daddy Roth might have thought up.

GREENHOUSE FLOOR, MILT'S POV  NIGHT A mouse goes running across the warped boards (which have pulled apart from each other, showing deep cracks between). INT.  MILT  NIGHT He relaxes and starts forward again. We keep expecting it to happen, but it keeps not happening. Then, as MILT is starting back toward the door, two big, hairy arms come up through the floor- bursting through two of those cracks and shoving the splintered boards upward- and grab MILT'S legs at the knees. SOUNDS: BESTIAL ROARS. MILT screams and triggers off the shotgun- unfortunately, it is pointing straight up. Glass showers down on him. He is pulled down into the shattered hole- now we can see him only from the knees up. INT.  TAMMY STURMFULLER'S BEDROOM She sits up in bed. SOUNDS of ROARS and MILT SCREAMING from the greenhouse. MRS. STURMFULLER, in a nightgown with her hair done up in rollers, comes into Tammy's room.",

THE GREENHOUSE, WITH MILT He's now waist deep in the hole in the floor, surrounded by broken, splintered boards. SOUNDS: RIPPING FLESH, CRUNCHING BONES. MILT SHRIEKS. He is abruptly jerked downward again. He is being eaten from the feet up. As he's jerked down, one of the leaning, splintered boards rams into his chest. MILT collapses over it like an old Roman collapsing on his sword. A hairy arm reaches up and grabs his neck. MILT is jerked all the way into the hole, board and all. EXT.  THE GREENHOUSE, FROM TAMMY'S BEDROOM WINDOW SOUNDS of SNARLS, GROWLS, GRUNTS. INT.  TAMMY AND MRS. STURMFULLER They are hugging each other, terrified, by the window. EXT.  THE STURMFULLER PLACE, MEDIUM-LONG  DAY The police cars are now here. There's also a meat wagon. As we watch, a number of cops- JOE HALLER and PETE SYLVESTER are among them- approach the wagon. Many are carrying canvas bags. EXT.  THE STURMFULLER YARD, FEATURING PETE SYLVESTER He drops the blood stained bag he's carrying, runs to the bushes, and noisily blows his groceries. EXT.  TARKER'S MILLS MONTAGE #3  DUSK a.) On Oak Street, MRS. THAYER is hurrying toward home, obviously spooked. She keeps looking behind herself and nearly flies up the steps to her house. Then there is the endless business of fumbling with her keys. Finally she lurches inside and slams the door. b.) On Main Street, at the Holy Family rectory, FATHER O'BANION is closing the shutters...and locking them. c.) On a residential street, a kid is playing with some plastic trucks outside of a picket fence. Except for him, the street is deserted. His mother comes out and hauls him in. d.) ANDY FAIRTON, in the sporting-goods store, checks an automatic pistol and then holsters it on his hip. He has a pugnacious, unpleasant look. e.) BILLY McCLAREN turns the sign on the door of his barber shop from OPEN to CLOSED, looks out warily at the street (to make sure there are no psycho killers out there for trims, I guess), then leaves and locks the door behind him. THE CAMERA FOLLOWS him down a couple of store fronts to Owen's, where he also goes in. f.) The paper rack in front of Peltzer's Drug/ The \"Press-Herald\" headline is a sixteen-pointer: MANIAC CLAIMS SECOND VICTIM. EXT.  MARTY AND BRADY KINCAID  MAGIC HOUR They're flying kites on the common. Some distance in the b.g. is the bandstand. MARTY is of course flying his kite as he sits in the Silver Bullet. The boys are having a blast. THE CAMERA SLOWLY MOVES AWAY from the boys, centers on Owen's Pub across the street, and ZOOMS IN. In the window is a poster. It reads: $10,000 REWARD FOR INFORMATION LEADING TO THE CAPTURE OF THE MAN (OR ANIMAL) WHO KILLED STELLA RANDOLPH AND MILTON STURMFULLER. And, at the bottom: TARKER'S MILLS CITIZENS' COMMITTEE. Along comes ANDY FAIRTON. He goes into the pub. INT.  OWEN'S PUB At a f.g. table: VIRGIL CUTTS, BOBBY ROBERTSON, ELMER ZINNEMAN, and his brother PORTER ZINNEMAN. Behind them, at the bar, we see PETE SYLVESTER having a beer with BILLY McCLAREN. As we look around the bar, we will also see FATHER LESTER LOWE, sitting at an unobtrusive corner table, nursing a beer and listening closely to the conversation.",

But if I believe anything it's this: we can comfort each other. We can heal each other. We can go on together. INT.  THE CONGREGATION, WITH MARTY AND TAMMY The kids are crying. MARTY puts an arm around TAMMY and she puts her head on his shoulder. INT.  FATHER LOWE LOWE The Bible tells us not to fear the terror that creepeth by night or that which flieth by noonday, and yet we do... we do. Because there is much we don't know, and we feel very small. But we must not be alone. We must not allow ourselves to be alone, for there is the wide gate to the hell of terror. Turn to each other. Join hands in your sorrow and try to remember that the face of the beast always becomes known. (Pause) The time of the beast always passes. (Pause) Let us pray. EXT.

The wind blows the hair off his forehead. He begins to grin. He's enjoying this. EXT.  UNCLE AL, WATCHING He drinks some beer. He's grinning, happy for MARTY. EXT.  MARTY, IN THE SILVER BULLET He slows down, turns, stops. He revs the engine. VROOM! VRROOM! EXT.  THE SILVER BULLET'S MOTOR, CU A lot of changes back here. It looks almost like a motorcyle engine now. That chromed-silver carb predominates. SOUND: VAROOOOOOOM! EXT.  MARTY, CU Grinning. Looking at: EXT.  THE COSLAW HOUSE, MARTY'S POV It's about a quarter of a mile away. EXT. MARTY, IN THE SILVER BULLET He winds the engine up and pops the clutch. The Silver Bullet doesn't so much accelerate as blast off. It tilts back on its wheels. MARTY swivels into a position like that of an astronaut on lift-off. The Silver Bullet looks like a motorcycle popping a wheelie. MARTY has a great big grin on his face. EXT.  THE SILVER BULLET, MEDIUM-LONG Roaring down the highway at fifty or better, blue smoke jetting from the exhaust. MARTY is plastered back in the seat with the footrest pointing up at an angle. He's laughing like a lunatic. EXT.  UNCLE AL, PEEKING THROUGH HIS FINGERS UNCLE AL (to himself) The kid's dead meat. What have I done? (shouts) Put a rock in it, Marty! EXT.  MARTY IN THE BULLET He uses the hand brakes. SOUND of braking and squealing rubber. EXT.  MARTY AND UNCLE AL The Silver Bullet comes to a screeching, sluing stop near UNCLE AL. Blue smoke drifts up from the wheels. MARTY guns the engine once and then lets it idle.",

THE REAR OF THE COSLAW HOUSE  NIGHT There's a downspout outside one of the upstairs windows. Now the window goes up and MARTY leans out. He grasps the downspout and begins working his way down. This should not be too hard for us to believe; we've already seen how strong MARTY'S arms are. His legs dangle limply, but he's doing just fine. When he reaches the bottom of the drainpipe, they simply crumple under him and he uses his arms to pull himself over to the back porch. MARTY hoists himself over the porch rail. Here, under a tarp, is the Silver Bullet. MARTY pushes the tarp aside and gets in. He uses his hands on the wheels to get over the porch ramp and rolls silently down it. At the bottom he looks up at: EXT.  AN UPSTAIRS WINDOW, MARTY'S POV  NIGHT Still a light on up there. EXT.  MARTY, IN THE BULLET MARTY (whispers) Shit! Thinks a bit, then starts to hand-roll the Bullet toward: EXT.  THE PATH BETWEEN THE HOUSE AND THE GARAGE MARTY comes slowly up the path. We hear soft grunts of exertion; he's still hand-turning the wheels for the sake of silence, and it's hard work. He stops at the line of bushes and gets the bag of fireworks. He puts it on his lap and starts moving again. EXT.  THE COSLAW DRIVEWAY, FROM THE ROAD The driveway has a slight downslant, and MARTY coasts easily out to the road. He turns right and begins to roll slowly along the verge of the highway, still using his hands. We can see that the light is still on upstairs. MARTY turns back once to verify this himself, then keeps on going. He's not going to be deprived of his treat. EXT.  MARTY He decides he's far enough away to be safe. He pushes the starter button. The engine cranks, coughs, and cranks some more. MARTY frowns, and pulls out a wire- a rudimentary choke, I suppose. He pushes the starter button again. It cranks, but doesn't start. MARTY pushes in the wire, looking concerned now, and tries again. This time, after the engine has cranked over a few times, it starts.",

MARTY turns in and rolls to the back of the rest area. He stops by one of the picnic tables and dumps the bag of fireworks out onto the picnic table and takes his time selecting the first- he's like a wine fancier with a whole cellar of rare bottles to choose from. At last he chooses a twizzer. He takes matches from the pocket of his pajama top and lights the fuse. When it starts to fizz, MARTY tosses it high into the air.",

MARTY With a little shrug, he lights the fuse on the fountain and sets it on the ground, as before. EXT.  THE BACK OF THE GROVE, AT THE TOP OF THE CUT Claw-hands settle over the top. EXT.  THE FOUNTAIN, CU It throws off fiery swirls of sparks, then begins to die down. EXT.  MARTY He's checking out the stuff on the table for his next choice when he hears a clear SOUND: A SNAPPING, SPLINTERING BRANCH. EXT.  THE GROVE, WITH THE WEREWOLF It's run into a low-hanging branch. Instead of pushing it aside or ducking under it, it simply rips it off the tree. Although the branch is pretty big, the WEREWOLF does this as easily as a hungry man might rip a drumstick off a Thanksgiving turkey. It throws the branch aside and advances, hunched over on two legs. EXT.  MARTY MARTY (terrified) Who's there? EXT.  THE GROVE AT THE BACK OF THE REST AREA, MARTY'S POV The grove is a darkened shadowland. EXT.  MARTY He punches the Bullet's starter. The motor cranks and cranks. No go, though. MARTY pulls out the choke wire, alternating terrified stares at the grove of trees with terrified stares at his rudimentary dashboard. EXT.  THE GROVE, MARTY'S POV Here it comes, out of the shadows, closing in. EXT.  MARTY Working that starter for all it's worth... but the motor only cranks. Still no start. EXT.  CLAWED, FURRY FEET EXT.  MARTY He gives up on the motor. He looks toward the picnic table where the fireworks are. He grabs up the tracer. He gets the matches out of the breast pocket of his p.j.'s and promptly drops them in his lap. He scrabbles for them. EXT.  THE WEREWOLF, MARTY'S POV We can't see its face in the dark, but it's closer... much closer. EXT.  MARTY He tries to hold the tracer and strike a match at the same time. He can't; to do that he'd need at least one more hand. He puts the tube of the tracer between his teeth and tries again. EXT.  THE MATCHBOOK AND MARTY'S HANDS He strikes the match... too hard! It bends, the neck broken.",

(NOTE: I keep emphasizing the shadowed face, because this is not a full-moon period. I've been going on the assumption that the guy kind of works his way up to full wolfiness, toothiness, hairiness, etc., starting with a partial change at about the second quarter. It's a process like the tide coming in. Thus, if we saw MARTY'S attacker clearly at this point, I think we would recognize him.) EXT.  MARTY, IN THE SILVER BULLET He takes the tracer from his mouth and applies the match to the fuse. It splutters alight. EXT.  MARTY AND THE WEREWOLF, A WIDER SHOT The WEREWOLF is less than twenty feet away. The tracer flares alight and shoots out of MARTY'S hand, leaving a pink-orange trail of smoke behind it. The missile flies at the WEREWOLF's head. EXT.  THE WEREWOLF The tracer strikes it in the face, and we see a flash of fire. The WEREWOLF screams and blunders away. EXT.  MARTY, IN THE SILVER BULLET He punches the starter again. The motor cranks. EXT.  THE MOTOR OF THE SILVER BULLET The motor coughs and fires; a big blue flame jumps from the fancy carb... and the engine starts to run. EXT.  THE WEREWOLF It's staggering away, ROARING and HOWLING. The tube of the tracer is sticking out of its face- from its left eye, in fact- like an Indian's arrow. The WEREWOLF smashes branches out of its way. EXT.  MARTY IN THE SILVER BULLET He wheels the Bullet around and heads for the road, gasping and weeping with fear. EXT.  THE WEREWOLF, IN THE GROVE It's blundering through the trees. It pulls the tube from its face with an ANIMAL SCREAM and drops it. EXT.  THE TRACER, CU It lies smoldering on the ground. The end is slick with blood. EXT.  THE ROAD, WITH MARTY The Bullet is really wheeling. MARTY is panting, out of breath, still deeply frightened. EXT.  THE WOODS, WITH THE WEREWOLF We see it blundering along, holding its face; blood bubbles through its fingers.",

THE UTILITY SHED-GARAGE FLOOR, JANE'S POV A good-sized mouse comes out from between a pile of stacked bottles and runs across JANE'S shoe. INT.  JANE She utters a litle scream and shrinks back against the wall, bumping it quite hard. Hard enough to knock something off an overhead shelf. It falls into the bottles, SHATTERING several. JANE screams again- not terribly loud- and then slowly bends toward the object and picks it up. JANE holds it, both puzzled and scared. EXT.

SOUND: Winding roar of a car engine. MARTY turns around. EXT.  LOWE'S COUPE, MARTY'S POV, ROARING AT THE CAMERA EXT.  MARTY AND LOWE'S COUPE MARTY opens the throttle wide and the Bullet swerves across the road. The coupe's bumper actually clips it on the way by, jolting MARTY and almost overturning the Bullet. LOWE'S coupe veers over the embankment and partway down into the ditch. INT.  LOWE, BEHIND THE WHEEL OF THE COUPE LOWE Oh, you bastard! He floors the engine. EXT.  THE COUPE'S REAR WHEELS Spinning helplessly in the dirt. EXT.  MARTY, IN THE SILVER BULLET He speeds past the coupe, and thumbs his nose. INT.  LOWE, IN THE COUPE He's in a teeth-grinding fury. He jams the gear-shift lever into reverse and floors the gas pedal again. EXT.  THE COUPE It roars backward in a cloud of ditch dust and bounces onto the road. Then it screams out after the rapidly disappearing Silver Bullet. EXT.  THE SILVER BULLET, WITH MARTY He hears the GROWLING SOUND of LESTER LOWE'S coupe. He looks behind. EXT.  THE COUPE Roars toward THE CAMERA. EXT.  MARTY, IN THE SILVER BULLET He twists the throttle and the Silver Bullet responds. EXT.  CHASE MONTAGE The director will shoot it as he likes- the basis is simple: LOWE is chasing MARTY's hopped-up wheelchair along a country road at speeds approaching fifty MPH. MARTY should have a couple of near misses, and perhaps we could actually have him pass one car. At one point we should have a REVERSE ANGLE on LESTER LOWE'S coupe, featuring two bumper stickers: ATTEND AND SUPPORT YOUR LOCAL CHURCH and HONK IF YOU LOVE JESUS! As the chase goes on it becomes apparent that LOWE is gaining. MARTY looks increasingly desperate. And now he looks down at: EXT.  THE SILVER BULLET'S GAS GAUGE, MARTY'S POV The needle is all the way over on \"E.\" EXT.  MARTY He groans. SOUND of the coupe's engine GROWS LOUDER. EXT.  THE COUPE AND THE SILVER BULLET LOWE charges, rapidly closing the distance. MARTY swerves from one side of the road to the other, escaping LOWE for the moment but almost overturning in the process. They are now running beside a river- the Auger River, in fact. EXT.  THE BULLET'S GAS GAUGE Now the needle is actually past \"E.\" EXT.  MARTY MARTY Come on, baby... come on... His face registers hope as he sees: EXT.  ROADSIDE SIGN, MARTY'S POV AUGER RIVER COVERED BRIDGE 2000 FEET AHEAD AUTOMOBILES PROHIBITED! EXT.  MARTY, IN THE BULLET He twists the throttle as far as it will turn- he's going for broke. The coupe chases him- and now the Silver Bullet's motor COUGHS. EXT.  THE BRIDGE, MARTY'S POV It's pretty ramshackle. A big orange sign beside it reads: BRIDGE UNSAFE! TRUCKS AND AUTOS ABSOLUTELY PROHIBITED! EXT.  THE SILVER BULLET MARTY brakes, hits the shoulder of the road, and somehow makes the turn. We see him holding on for dear life as the Silver Bullet bounces and jounces down the dirt road to the mouth of the covered bridge. EXT.  LOWE'S COUPE It overshoots the right turn MARTY just took, screeches to a halt, backs up, and turns onto the lane. EXT.  THE SILVER BULLET It bounces up the incline to the bridge, MOTOR COUGHING AND SPLUTTERING. EXT.  THE COUPE It comes to a sliding, dirt-digging stop. INT.  LOWE, BEHIND THE WHEEL His face is so full of frustrated hate that it has become the face of a gargoyle. EXT.  THE SIGN PROHIBITING MOTOR TRAFFIC, LOWE'S POV EXT./INT.  THE COVERED BRIDGE, WITH THE BULLET It's dim and spooky in here. Cracks between the boards of the side walls allow dusty fingers of daylight to shine through. More light rays up from the cracks in the floor. The floorboards are warped and uneven; MARTY'S wheelchair sways drunkenly from side to side. The total inside passage is about seventy feet. About halfway across, the Silver Bullet coughs its last cough and splutters its last splutter. It rolls along silently, going on its dying momentum. EXT.  THE FAR END OF THE BRIDGE, MARTY'S POV Drawing closer. We hear the SOUNDS of boards rumbling under the Silver Bullet's tires and the Auger River beneath. EXT.  MARTY, REVERSE Rolling ever more slowly, the Silver Bullet approaches THE CAMERA... and stops. MARTY is covered with sweat. His hair is in a wild tangle. He's panting. He looks at: EXT.  THE LANE LEADING AWAY FROM THE BRIDGE, MARTY'S POV This is an extremely rustic lane. Pretty, but hardly the sort of place in which one would want to find oneself when one has a part-time werewolf and a full-time homicidal maniac close behind. EXT.  MARTY, AT THE MOUTH OF THE BRIDGE LOWE (soft voice) Marty... MARTY'S head whips around. EXT.  THE FAR END OF THE BRIDGE, MARTY'S POV We see a brilliant square of light. In it stands LOWE'S silhouette. The silhouette begins to move. SOUND of footfalls on the loose floorboards of the covered bridge. INT.  LOWE'S SHOES Sensible black Oxfords.",

JOE HALLER gets out, and as he does there's a business of pulling his pants legs down over his boots- nice stitched cowboy boots, not black cop's shoes. We want the audience to notice these boots, remember them- probably HALLER should wear them all through the picture. He goes up the walk. HALLER rings the doorbell. No one comes. HALLER rings the bell again. Waits. No one comes. He leans down and looks through a side window. INT.  THE RECTORY HALL AND SITTING ROOM, HALLER'S POV No one there. EXT.  HALLER He goes down the steps, stands on the path for a moment, and then goes over to the shed-garage. He opens the door and looks in. EXT./INT.  THE GARAGE, HALLER'S POV LOWE'S coupe is in there. There's just room for it amid the shadowy piles of bottles and cans. INT.  THE GARAGE, WITH HALLER He goes around to the front of LOWE'S coupe and squats down. In the b.g.: a heaped mountain of aluminum beer and soda cans. HALLER feels in his breast pocket and brings out a Zippo. He lights it and looks at: INT.  THE COUPE, CU One of the turn-signal lamps is broken. There's a scratch in the paint and a dent in the bumper. HALLER'S fingers come into the frame and touch the scratch. They stop, and THE CAMERA ZOOMS IN to a small streak of silvery paint. As MARTY has a scrape of blue car paint on his wheelchair, so does LOWE have a scrape of silver wheelchair paint on his car. INT.  HALLER His eyes widen. SOUND: SHATTERING ROAR and the CLINK AND TUMBLE of about nine thousand cans as LOWE erupts from under the aluminum scrap heap behind HALLER. He is a mixture of man and werewolf, and quite clearly a beastial version of LOWE. In one hand he holds the remains of OWEN KNOPFLER'S peacemaker. HALLER starts to turn; LOWE strikes him with the bat. CAMERA CLOSES IN ON LOWE as the bat rises and falls... rises and falls. We can't see HALLER, and that is probably a mercy, but we can hear the THUD of the bat as it strikes again and again and again. EXT.  THE REST AREA AT AUGER FALLS, WITH MARTY, AL, JANE DAY UNCLE AL has taken the Coslaw family station wagon today. The three of them are sitting in the grove of trees.",

At that moment most of the wall- not just the window it was looking through before but the whole wall- crashes inward as the WEREWOLF bulls its way through, roaring. UNCLE AL whirls, raising the pistol automatically to fire- but the cylinder is rolled out and all the chambers are empty. He has time to register surprise before the WEREWOLF smashes him aside. INT.  UNCLE AL, A NEW ANGLE He goes flying backward. The pistol goes one way, the silver bullet another. INT.  THE GUN It spins into a living-room corner. INT.  THE SILVER BULLET, SLOW MOTION We see it rise in the air, turning over and over. It comes down, hits the floor, and rolls. INT.  THE HALLWAY FLOOR, WITH THE BULLET, SLOW MOTION In the extreme f.g. is a heating vent. The bullet is rolling toward it. INT.  MARTY AND JANE MARTY Get the gun! He uses his hands to propel the ungainly Silver Bullet into the hall. INT.  THE BULLET (THE REAL BULLET) AND MARTY, SLOW MOTION The silver bullet rolls slowly toward the heating vent. In the b.g. we see a frantic MARTY in his wheelchair. He heaves himself out of it and falls full-length, grabbing. His fingers touch the bullet, but that's all. It falls in the heating vent. INT.  THE WEREWOLF, CU It's roaring, furious, its one eye flaring. INT.  THE LIVING ROOM, WIDE UNCLE AL lies senseless against one wall, the front of his shirt bloody. JANE runs into the corner and grabs the pistol. The WEREWOLF picks up the easy chair and throws it through the hole it made coming in. It picks up an end table and hurls it through the TV. Then it sees JANE and starts toward her. INT.  JANE, COWERING IN THE CORNER INT.  THE WEREWOLF, CU Comes toward her. INT.  JANE IN THE CORNER She makes as if to run one way. INT.  JANE AND THE WEREWOLF It's only a couple of feet from her now, but again, it is toying with her- it's making this reeeal slow. INT.  THE FIREPLACE TOOLS, CU A bloodstained hand grabs a poker. INT.  THE WEREWOLF AND JANE As it tenses down to leap at her, UNCLE AL leaps at it and strikes it across the back. It turns, ROARING. UNCLE AL hits it between the legs. It BELLOWS and grabs the poker. It bends it and tosses it aside. The glaring, savage expression on its face says that now it will bend UNCLE AL and toss him aside. INT.  JANE She breaks out of the corner and runs across the room toward the door. Most of the way there she trips and falls. INT.  THE WEREWOLF, CU Its head whips around. INT.  MARTY, IN THE HALL He's lying full-length. He's got the heater vent's grille off. One arm is down inside.",
