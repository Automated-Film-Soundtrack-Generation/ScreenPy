Behind him, a window to the street with strips of paper taped on it as protection against blast. Without warning, a bomb drops nearby, then another and another. The whole building shudders alarmingly and the window in the booth shatters. The engineer and Szpilman exchange a look as a man enters the booth and talks urgently to the Engineer, then goes. The engineer makes a 'cut-throat' gesture, but Szpilman shakes his head, determined to play on. He plays, then glances at the booth. The engineer has gone, but through the shattered window he sees fires raging. Very near, a loud, terrifying explosion. The reverberations cause plaster to flake and dust to trickle down over his face. And then a bomb explodes even closer. The glass screen separating booth from studio implodes, showering Szpilman with glass. He stops, frozen.",

The sound of the German voice swearing and the dull, crunching noise made by the boot smashing into the boy continues, and with every thud the boy screams in terrible pain. Szpilman struggles to help the boy whose screams are becoming weaker yet increasingly desperate. Szpilman pulls his arms and finally manages to get him through. The boy lies moaning.

German soldiers with flame-throwers advance carefully then unleash their fire into doorways and windows, and quickly retreat. At ground level, Jewish fighters try to fight their way out and are mowed down. The fire spreads quickly through the building. Smoke begins to pour from the upper floors. The Germans, less cautious now, stand and watch. A woman struggles out on to her narrow third-floor balcony. She climbs over, holds on to the wrought-iron railings and hangs on for dear life. Shots ring out and she drops like a stone. From inside the building, screams and shouts. From another upper window, a man in flames jumps and falls to his death on the pavement below.

The tram continues on its way, now revealing the few passengers who alighted '97 women, an old man with a stick. Last, three young Poles, carrying long objects wrapped in newspaper. One of the men looks at his watch, glances around, then suddenly kneels and puts the package he's carrying to his shoulder. The sound of rapid firing, which makes the newspaper at the end of the packet glow to reveal the barrel of a machine gun. His two companions have also put their packages to their shoulders and begin shooting, all aiming their fire at the Schutzpolizei building. The sentry is hit and falls in front of his box. As if these young men have given a signal, now from all over the city comes the sound of gunfire. The pedestrians have scattered except for the old man, gasping for breath, hobbling on his walking stick, who eventually manages to disappear inside a building. Rifle and machine-gun fire from the Schutzpolizei building. The firing intense. The three young Poles manoeuvre to the corner opposite the Schutzpolizei and toss grenades into the building. EXT.
