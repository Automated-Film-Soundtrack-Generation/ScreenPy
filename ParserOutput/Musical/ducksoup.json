Harpo, astonished, looks down on the victim who, minus the toupe, now displays a shiny bald pate. Harpo takes out his fountain pen and releases gadget. The ink pours down on the bald spot of the man below and spreads into the form of a toupe parted in the middle.  CUT BACK to Harpo - he places the toupe on the bare back side of a figure of Cupid carved on the arch.  He is now suddenly attracted by something on the stage -- it is a pool with a practical fountain in its center.  Harpo digs into a decorative flower box set in a groove in the proscenium arch. He brings out a real live worm and baits his hook -- stands up and casts... the line swishes through the air and the hook lands in the pool on the stage.  The line instantly tightens and a large carp fish is yanked out of the pool... as the line is drawn in the fish nearly hits Mrs. Teasdale. She covers her face with her hands.  Chico takes advantage of her action, grabs the line, removes the fish, and puts hook on handle of purse...  then signals Harpo with a whistle and in the manner of a construction foreman, motions to him to start \"hoisting\".  The line becomes taut and the purse is yanked out of view.  Mrs. Teasdale uncovers her face and discovers that the purse is missing.",
