She nervously gets up again and looks at a framed photograph for a moment then hides the photograph under a pillow on the couch.  She puts on a record, \"FOR YOUR PRECIOUS LOVE.\"  She sits back down and chews her nail again, listening to the MUSIC; she starts to cry.  She stops herself and takes the record off.  She starts taking off her stocking.  She then takes off her dress. Underneath, she has on a bra and panties.  She crosses the living room, goes down the hallway into the bathroom. Jeffrey can't see her too well now.  She takes off her panties in the bathroom.  She is now naked.  She looks at herself in the mirror.  We see Jeffrey's face as he watches her.  She disappears from view completely and we HEAR her start a SHOWER.",

See you at breakfast. Love Mom.\"  A postscript is written on the note by Aunt Barbara.  \"Jeffrey, honey, I found these. Love, Aunt Barbara.\"  Jeffrey sees that Aunt Barbara has left him two dead termites. He picks one up and studies it.  Again we see a huge CLOSEUP of a termite in the half-light.

INT. STAIRWAY - APARTMENT BUILDING - NIGHT Jeffrey slowly climbs the stairs.  His shoes squashing the carpet make mall crushing sounds as he climbs higher into the building. He arrives at the Seventh Floor and stops.  A high-pitched whine can be heard faintly.  It gets louder as Jeffrey crosses to Dorothy's apartment door.  He gets his key out and inserts it.  Turns it.  With a loud click the door swings open and the high whine becomes piercing.  He sees something and jumps back. 211. INT. DOROTHY'S APARTMENT - NIGHT It is Detective Gordon, the Yellow Man, standing in the center of the room. FLASHBACK He plays the look into the apartment again in his mind and again. CLOSER ON DETECTIVE GORDON Something is wrong with him.  He is bleeding from the head.  He stands almost motionless. in shock. Jeffrey peers into the room again.  He enters carefully and lets the door close behind him.  He very cautiously moves forward into the room.  Slowly he moves closer to a hideous sight.  Standing in the middle of Dorothy's apartment is T.R. Gordon, the Yellow Man.  He is in an extreme state of shock.  He is bleeding badly from a huge wound at the top left of his head.  His eyes focused on something only his twisted inner mind see.  Sitting in one of Dorothy's chairs is a dead man with no ears. only half-healed bloody wounds at each side of his head.  A bullet hole in the center of his forehead.  The T.V. is crushed in but it is turned on and it is the television that produces the high electrical whine.  Jeffrey moves forward again and kicks the television cord out of the wall.  The high whine stops instantly.  Silence except for the Yellow Man's labored breathing. Suddenly there is a loud \"radio voice\" coming from the Yellow Man's police radio which is turned \"on\" in his jacket pocket.  Jeffrey's heart leaps and just as suddenly the Yellow Man throws his arms out wildly knocking a floor lamp to the ground and crushing out its light.  Jeffrey's heart goes wild at this sight and he jumps back but the Yellow Man is silent and motionless again.  The radio talks again.",
