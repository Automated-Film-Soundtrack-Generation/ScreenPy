Almost all the land is improved, either through cultivation for farming purposes of through careful landscaping, in the shape of parks and lakes.

A couple of coins fall on the pile. The stoop of a period door with old-fashioned enamel milk can and a bag of rolls.  Across the sidewalk before this, moves the shadow of an old-fashioned bicycle with an enormous front wheel.  A copy of the \"Enquirer\" is tossed on the stoop. A breakfast table - beautiful linen and beautiful silver - everything very expensive, gleaming in the sunshine.  Into a silver newspaper rack there is slipped a copy of the \"Enquirer\". Here, as before, the boxed editorial reading MY PRINCIPLES - A DECLARATION BY CHARLES FOSTER KANE, is very prominent on the front page. The wooden floor of a railroad station, flashing light and dark as a train behind the camera rushes by.  On the floor, there is tossed a bound bundle of the \"New York Enquirer\" - the Declaration of Principles still prominent. Rural Delivery - a copy of the \"Enquirer\"s being put into bins, showing state distribution. The railroad platform again.  We stay here for four images. On each image, the speed of the train is faster and the piles of the \"Enquirer\" are larger.  On the first image, we move in to hold on the words \"CIRCULATION - 31,000.\"  We are this close for the next pile which reads 40,000; the next one which reads 55,000, and the last which is 62,000.  In each instance, the bundles of newspapers are thicker and the speed of the moving train behind the camera is increased. The entire montage above indicated is accompanied by a descriptive complement of sound - the traffic noises of New York in the 1890's; wheels on cobblestones and horses' hooves; bicycle bells; the mooning of cattle and the crowing of roosters (in the RFD shot), and in all cases where the railroad platform is used - the mounting sound of the railroad train. The last figure \"62,000\" opposite the word \"CIRCULATION\" on the \"Enquirer\" masthead changes to:",

The door is opened and a condemned man, with priest, warden and the usual attendants, moves into foreground and starts up the hall past a group which includes phtographers, Kane's sob- sister, and Kane.  The photographers take pictures with a mighty flash of old-fashioned flash powder.  The condemned man in the foreground (in silhouette) is startled by this. DISSOLVE: A copy of the \"Enquirer\" spread out on a table.  A big lay-out of the execution story includes the killer as photographed by Kane's photographers, and nearby on the other page there is a large picture of the new steam fire engine (made from the stock shot) with a headline indicating that the \"Enquirer\" has won its campaign for better equipment.  A cup of coffee and a doughnut are on the newspaper, and a servant girl - over whose shoulder we see the paper - is stirring the coffee. The Beaux Art Ball.  A number of elderly swells are jammed into a hallway.  Servants suddenly divest them of their furs, overcoats and wraps, revealing them to be in fancy dress costume, pink fleshings, etc., the effect to be very surprising, very lavish and very very ridiculous.  We see, among others, Mr. Thatcher himself (as Ben Hur) ribbon around, his bald head and all.  At the conclusion of this tableau, the image freezes and we pull back to show it reproduced on the society page of the \"New York Enquirer.\" Over the \"Enquirer\"'s pictorial version of the Beaux Art Ball is thrown a huge fish - then coffee grounds - altogether a pretty repulsive sight. The whole thing is bundled up and thrown into a garbage can. Extreme close-up of the words: \"OCCUPATION - JOUNALIST.\" Camera pulls back to show passport open to the photograph page which shows Kane, registering birth, race, and nationality. Passport cover is closed, showing it to be an American passport.",

That was because he had the power to express them, and Charlie lived on power and the excitement of using it -  But he didn't believe in anything except Charlie Kane.  He never had a conviction in his life. I guess he died without one - That must have been pretty unpleasant.  Of course, a lot of us check out with no special conviction about death.

Applause is heard at the opening of the shot, and now the orchestra starts thunderously.  The curtain starts to rise - the camera with it - the blinding glare of the foots moves up Susan's body and hits her face.  She squints and starts to sing.  Camera continues on up with the curtain, up past Susan, up the full height of the proscenium arch and then on up into the gridiron into a world of ropes, brick walls and hanging canvas - Susan's voice still heard - but faintly.  The camera stops at the top of the gridiron as the curtain stops.  Two typical stage hands fill the frame.  They are looking down on the stage below.  Some of the reflected light gleams on their faces.  They look at each other.  One of them puts his hand to his nose.",

She walks a few steps towards the middle of the block, and can stand it no longer.  She stops, opens a bottle of Oil of Cloves that she has in her hand, applies some to her finger, and rubs her gums. She walks on, the pain only a bit better.  Four or five houses farther along, she comes to what is clearly her own doorway - a shabby, old four-story apartment house.  She turns toward the doorway, which is up a tiny stoop, about three steps. As she does so, Kane, coming from the opposite direction, almost bumps into her and turns to his left to avoid her.  His shoulder bumps hers and she turns.  As she does so, Kane, forced to change his course, steps on the loose end of a plank which covers a puddle in the bad sidewalk.  The plank rises up and cracks him on the knee, also covering him with mud.",

As the dissolve commences, there is the sound of applause (exactly as before) and now as the dissolve completes itself, the orchestra breaks frighteningly into opening chords of the music - the stage is cleared - Susan is left alone, terribly alone.  The curtain rises.  The glare of the footlights jump into the image.  The curtain is now out of the picture and Susan starts to sing.  Beyond her, we see the prompter's box, containing the anxious face of the prompter.  Beyond that, out in the darkness - an apprehensive conductor struggles with his task of coordinating an orchestra and an incompetent singer. Beyond that - dimly white shirt fronts and glistening bosoms for a couple of rows, and then deep and terrible darkness. Closeup of Kane's face - seated in the audience - listening. Sudden but perfectly correct lull in the music reveals a voice from the audience - a few words from a sentence - the kind of thing that often happens in a theatre -",

Then, near the camera, there is the sound of about a dozen people applauding very, very loudly.  Camera moves back, revealing Bernstein and Reilly and other Kane stooges, seated around him, beating their palms together.  The curtain is falling - as we can see by the light which shutters down off their faces. The stage from Kane's angle. The curtain is down - the lights glowing on it.  Still, the polite applause dying fast.  Nobody comes out for a bow. Closeup of Kane - breathing heavily.  Suddenly he starts to applaud furiously. The stage from the audience again. Susan appears for her bow.  She can hardly walk.  There is a little polite crescendo of applause, but it is sickly. Closeup of Kane - still applauding very, very hard, his eyes on Susan. The stage again. Susan, finishing her bow, goes out through the curtains.  The light on the curtain goes out and the houselights go on. Closeup of Kane - still applauding very, very hard.",

He continues with tremendous speed and surprising strength, still wordlessly, tearing the room to bits.  The curtains (too frilly - overly pretty) are pulled off the windows in a single gesture, and from the bookshelves he pulls down double armloads of cheap novels - discovers a half-empty bottle of liquor and dashes it across the room.  Finally he stops.  Susie's cozy little chamber is an incredible shambles all around him. He stands for a minute breathing heavily, and his eye lights on a hanging what-not in a corner which had escaped his notice. Prominent on its center shelf is the little glass ball with the snowstorm in it.  He yanks it down.  Something made of china breaks, but not the glass ball.  It bounces on the carpet and rolls to his feet, the snow in a flurry.  His eye follows it.  He stoops to pick it up - can't make it.  Raymond picks it up for him; hands it to him.
