Deserted spaces long forgotten  -  dusty, crumbling. He feels the fish moving about in his pocket, pulls it out and looks at it. White holds the dying fish in one hand, the bowl of cold soup in the other.  Disgusted, he puts the fish into the bowl. INT.  CORRIDOR A TICKING SOUND O.S. White stops.  Looks up.

He scrawls rapidly, screws the message into a tight tube, then puts it into a METAL CYLINDER he finds beneath the table also. He glances out a window, notices A FIGURE standing beneath a street-lamp below, looking up at him.  Startled, Fredrick darts back into shadow, goes to a wall covered in about a dozen vertical PIPES running up into the ceiling. TIGHT ON ONE OF THE PIPES  -  he opens a small hatch and puts the metal cylinder in it.  The cylinder is snatched from his hand, sucked into the pipe with a rush of air. WIDER Fredrick steps back, a sigh of relief.  A shadow falls across his back.  He turns.  He screams. INT./EXT.  VARIOUS TIGHT  -  rushing along lengths of rusted pipe, at blinding speed.  The cylinder races around corners.  It clanks and grinds.  HURTLES up the side of a building.  THEN PLUMMETS underground.  Rushes through darkness. EXT.  BRIDGE  -  NIGHT THE CAMERA MOVES along a bridge-like structure.  An enclosed corridor supported by rotting wooden pylons.  Under the bridge, pipes spew sewage into stagnant water. ANGLE ON WHITE WALKING  -  seen through a series of illuminated, dirty, windows.  He occasionally glances into the bowl he holds before him. INSIDE TIGHT ON the fish swimming weakly in the soup. ANGLE ON WHITE  -  He stops, looks up at O.S. SOUND of clattering metal.  A pipe runs the length of the corridor  - the invisible clanging cylinder races away, into darkness. Then the silence is shattered by a piercing series of SCREAMS somewhere in the building.  White hurriedly moves towards the source. ANOTHER CORRIDOR White rounds a corner, stops, notices a small rectangular HOLE in a wall.  ANOTHER SCREAM, weaker now  -  He runs to the hole in the wall and looks through. HIS P.O.V. A small, very ordered ROOM.  A fake fireplace bathes the room in a warm glow. White cranes his neck forward, stretches his head through the hole.  He can see into an adjoining room to his right  -  two dark figures stand over a man on the floor lying in a pool of dark crimson.  The man looks up  -  itis Fredrick  -  just as both dark figures stab him repeatedly with bloody daggers.  He doesnit scream this time, just gags on blood running from his mouth. Suddenly a sliding door SLAMS onto the back of Whiteis neck, traps his head in the hole.  He struggles, tries to free himself.  Drops the bowl of soup.  It shatters on the hard floor, makes a mess. INSIDE THE BATHROOM  -  The killers look up at the smashing noise. BACK IN THE CORRIDOR  -  White pulls with all his strength. The door gives and he stumbles backwards.  He is about to run away but glances at the floor. The fish is flapping about  -  still alive. EXT.  STREET White darts from a doorway, trips and falls.  He sprawls at the base of sweeping stone steps.  He looks at a building towering above him.  Chiselled in the facade, above the entrance: LIBRARY. INT.  POLICE STATION A series of ply-wood SILHOUETTES race through frame.  Stop suddenly, mechanically.  LOUD GUNSHOTS.  Chunks of ply-wood blast away violently. BUMSTEAD is practising his marksmanship. A HAND  -  on his shoulder.  He whips around, startled. ON MISS CRENSHAW  -  a young, stiff-looking woman.",

He finds section C then walks between towering rows stacked with old volumes.  Comes to number 7. He follows an arrow past row after row  -  finally finds Row 34 but then it skips straight to letters again, A, B, C, etc. No Row 35. He stops and looks around  -  sure enough a door displays a small sign:  TOILETS. White is sweating profusely.  He now sits on a chair, takes off his shoes, rubs his feet.  He pulls a book from a shelf behind him, looks about, opens the book and tears several pages out, folds them, stuffs them into his shoes to plug up the holes. He gets up, tries to backtrack, comes across an elaborate diagram of the library interior.  An arrow points to a section near a wing labelled:  MAPS.  Near the arrow it says:  YOU ARE HERE. He keeps walking. He finds the door to the maps wing but the door is locked, a sign is nailed to it:  WE ARE REMODELLING.  WE APOLOGIZE FOR ANY INCONVENIENCE. White, annoyed now, tries to force his way in.  Puts his shoulder to the door, pushes several times.  It CRUMBLES under his weight  -  rotten. He finds himself in a DUSTY ROOM. HIS P.O.V. A narrow room, filled with rows of bookshelves with stacks of old newspapers. TIGHT ON WHITE  -  he steps forward, pulls a folded newspaper off the shelf.  The instant he picks it up, it crumbles to dust in his hands.  He picks up another, and another, each in turn breaking apart and dissolving to nothingness. INT.  DARK CHAMBER  -  NIGHT TWO SILHOUETTED FIGURES face each other across a polished black table.  They speak in a foreign language.  A phone rings. Figure 1 picks up the receiver and listens attentively. Figure 2 is involved with various metal shapes he is trying to lock together.  A complex puzzle.  He gets impatient with the puzzle, dashes it to the floor. Figure 1, on the phone, hangs up and writes something.  Hands the note to Figure 2, who in turn drops it into A CHUTE. CONTROL ROOM The note falls from a slot in the wall before Figure 3 (in shadow yet again).  He reads from the note over a silver microphone, still in the unfamiliar tongue. TIGHT ON A SPEAKER  -  his distorted voice.  A final mysterious person  -  Figure 4  -  listens to the announcement.  He takes a stick and moves a small cut-out figure of a man across a board, away from a large grouping of similar cut-outs.  The board resembles a planning table in a war-room. A HIGH ANGLE as the CAMERA PULL BACKS on the grouping of cut out figures.  More and more of them.  Ten.  Twenty.  A hundred. A sinister army. INT.  INTERSECTING STREET  -  NIGHT White is in a phone booth.  He removes the note from his pocket, dials.  No answer again.  He dials the OPERATOR.  A muffled voice over the line.",

The Man steps back, spouting liquid from the bullet hole, hits a low railing, FALLS into the shaft at the centre of the tower. The second Man SWINGS his dagger at White. White falls backwards, dropping his gun clumsily.  The Man advances, smiling  -  kicks the gun across the wooden floor.

White looks at the woman, then back at his hands  -  NOTHING STRANGE, they are normal size, but somehow the cuffs have been removed.  He looks at the woman again, grateful.  He can't help smiling.

She pushes him back on the couch and pulls her dressing gown open. White does not respond  -  seems uncertain.  She sits upright, astride his body, unbuckles his belt, opens his shirt, caresses his chest.  She stops, her face in shadow. Slowly, White lifts his hands to her breasts, touches them.

They chant, quietly at first, steadily building in volume.  The MEN stand and MOVE RHYTHMICALLY to some inner beat. The CAMERA MOVES ACROSS to a diagram pinned on a board.  A representation of a man's legs.  Trousers rolled up above the knees, showing a number of bite-like wounds on the flesh. Labels point out various parts of the legs in medical fashion -  the legends are an unknown language. ON THE ROOF The antenna glows with a ghostly green light.  O.S. SCREAMS RISE UP FROM THE STREET. INT.  APARTMENT/KITCHEN  -  LATER White downs a cup of black coffee, staring blankly out the window.  O.S. distant screams. He glances across to a wall, notices A FLY there  -  something about it looks WRONG. FLY'S P.O.V. A distorted electronic image of White's FACE looming up. At exactly that moment the FLY TAKES OFF, flies erratically down the hall, around a turn and disappears.  White follows. HALL-WAY White moves quietly towards the bedroom door. HIS P.O.V. It is ajar, dark inside.  Movement.  The women are naked on the bed.  The JAPANESE WOMAN has her eyes shut, head back in ecstasy. The WIFE is bent over her, kissing her stomach. ANGLE ON WHITE  -  watching through the crack in the door.  The women are oblivious. He moves away slowly, feeling strange.  His feet stop making contact with the floor.  He grabs a table to steady himself. The table-cloth comes away, things spill to the floor and smash. He's FLOATING. White desperately reaches out to grab something, holds the light-fixture in the ceiling.  It breaks off in a cloud of plaster.  Sparks briefly illuminate.  He falls heavily ONTO THE CEILING  -  now the floor.  The apartment is upside down. He stares up at furniture and objects. THE BATHROOM White steps into the room, eerily illuminated by a glowing heater stuck to the floor.  Water is running  -  filling the tub and overflowing, making a suspended puddle above White's head. White takes off his clothes and climbs the wall, towards the floor.  It's difficult, but he reaches the tap, turns it off. Pulls himself towards the tub. Gravity becomes NORMAL AGAIN as he sinks in the warm water. He's incredibly weak  -  floats limply in the bath.  Submerges his face.  A distant throbbing O.S., like a huge machine heart somewhere in the building. He opens his eyes, still underwater, stares up at the ceiling. HIS P.O.V. A blurry DARK FIGURE moves into his vision.  It stares down at him. White rigid with fright, cannot focus on the figure through the thin veil of water.  The FIGURE reaches out.  A GLOVED HAND grabs White about the throat, holds him forcefully.  White gulps for air, swallows water.  His eyes widen.  He tries to stop the hand strangling him but can't. Suddenly the hand pulls away.  The BLURRY FIGURE stumbles back and ERUPTS into bloody explosion.  The body splits apart, throwing internal organs through the room. White awakens in the bathtub.  He looks about the room.  Empty. Silent.  He gets out of the water, starts to dress. EXT.  BUILDING BUMSTEAD'S car pulls up.  He gets out, stained here and there with bile. INT.  APARTMENT A HIGH ANGLE on the slain bodies of the JAPANESE WOMAN and WHITE'S WIFE.  TWO COPS wander about the dark room, doing stuff.  Bumstead walks up to the cop in charge.",
