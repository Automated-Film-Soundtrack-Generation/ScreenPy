(inauguration shots) At his inauguration, at a time when American males all wore hats, he let his hair blow free in the wind. Alongside his beautiful and elegant wife of French origin, Jacqueline Bouvier, J.F.K. is the symbol of the new freedom of the 1960's, signifying change and upheaval to the American public, scaring many and hated passionately by some.  To win the election and to appease their fears, Kennedy at first takes a tough Cold War stance.",

Castro is a successful revolutionary frightening to American business interests in Latin America - companies like Cabot's United Fruit, Continental Can, and Rockefeller's Standard Oil.  This war culminates in the disastrous Bay of Pigs invasion in April 1961, when Kennedy refuses to provide air cover for the exile brigade.  Of the 1600 men who invade, 114 are killed, 1200 are captured.  The Cuban exiles and the CIA are furious at Kennedy's irresolution... Kennedy, taking public responsibility for the failure, privately claims the CIA lied to him and tried to manipulate him into ordering an all-out American invasion of Cuba.  He vows to splinter the CIA into a thousand pieces and fires Director Allen Dulles, Deputies Charles Cabell and Richard Bissell, the top leadership of the Agency.",

In November 1963, he orders the withdrawal by Christmas of the first 1000 troops of the 16,000 stationed in Vietnam. He tells several of his intimates that he will withdraw all Vietnam troops after the '64 election, saying to the Assistant Secretary of State, Roger Hilsman, \"The Bay of Pigs has taught me one, not to trust generals or the CIA, and two, that if the American people do not want to use American troops to remove a Communist regime 90 miles from our coast, how can I ask them to use troops to remove a Communist regime 9,000 miles away?\"... Finally, in August 1963, over the objections of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, the United States, Great Britain and the Soviet Union sign a treaty banning nuclear bomb tests in the atmosphere, underwater and in space...  Early that fateful summer, Kennedy speaks of his new vision at American University in Washington.",

Kennedy is seeking change on all fronts.  Bitter battles are fought with Southern segregationists to get James Meredith into the University of Mississippi. Three months after Kennedy submits a sweeping civil rights bill to Congress, Martin Luther King leads 250,000 in a march on Washington. Robert Kennedy, as Attorney General, for the first time ever vigorously prosecutes the Mafia in American life, bringing and winning a record number of cases - 288 convictions of organized crime figures including 13 grand juries against Jimmy Hoffa and his Teamsters Union.  The President also takes on Big Business, forcing back steel prices, winning 45 of 46 antitrust cases during 1963 and he wants to help everyday taxpayers by ending age- old business privileges like the oil depletion allowance and the fees paid to the Federal Reserve Bank for printing America's currency. Revolutionary changes are foreseen after J.F.K.'s assumed re-election in 1964.  Foremost in the political consciousness of the country is the possibility of a Kennedy dynasty. Robert Kennedy in '68, Teddy Kennedy in '76.  In November, 1963 John Kennedy travels to Texas, his popularity sagging to 59% largely due to his civil rights stand for which he is particularly hated in the South.  Texas is a crucial state for him to carry in '64.  With him is Vice-President, Lyndon Johnson and Texas Governor John Connally. On November 21, they visit Houston and San Antonio.  On the morning of November 22, he speaks in Fort Worth, then flies 15 minutes to Love Field in Dallas, where he takes a motorcade through downtown Dallas on his way to speak at 12:30 at the International Trade Mart.  Later, the motorcade takes him through Dealey Plaza at 12:30...",

We see a close-up of the clock moving to 12:36.  We hear the sound of a pen on paper, scratching... We see a shot of Jim Garrison as a young air pilot in World War II; hear the sound of airplanes.  The camera moves to framed photos of Jim as a young, Lincolnesque lawyer... we hear sounds of political rallies, cheering... a shot of Jim's grandfather shaking hands with President William Taft.  The sound of bulldozers carries us to a shot of Jim staring at piles of decaying corpses at Dachau... a photo of Clarence Darrow... a law degree and an appointment as District Attorney of the New Orleans Parish... Mother Garrison with young Jim on the desk... another family - his own.  We look across the thick desk with the chess set, A Complete Works of William Shakespeare and a Nazi helmet with a bullet hole in it... to Jim himself writing - pen to paper.  We sense the quiet intellect of the 43 year old man.  The clock ticks in the awful suspended silence. It's as if the air itself has been sucked from the silent room.  This is the last moment of peace before the World will rush through the door in all its sound and fury - to change his life forever.  The camera haywires into a close- up of Jim as he looks up... and knows. Lou Ivon, Jim's chief investigator, is already standing there in the room.  He is burly, in his 30s - his expression universal for that day.",

Maybe, just maybe, Lee Oswald was exactly what he said he was Bill - \"a patsy\".  Take it at face value.  Lou, Susie, I'm going with my gut here.  He's got an alias of Hidell to buy the rifle, \"O.H. Lee\" to rent the room, right?  What's in a name, right?  In intelligence, they're assumed to be fake.  A name is sort of like a postbox number, a code - several different people can use the same name, right?  Then why can't somebody be using Oswald's name?",

                    "raw_text": "the Pentagon offices in 1963.  X strides down a busy hall and into the offices of one of his superiors, Major General Y, a lean, cold warrior, battlefield handsome, civilian clothes, and several advisors.  There's a U.S. flag on the wall.  The status of Y is only clear by the sing on the desk, the name blocked by a passing figure. X ...a strange thing happened.  I was sent by my superior officer, call him Y, to the South Pole as the military escort for a group of international VIP's.  This trip had nothing to do with my nine years of work in Special Operations.  It was sort of a \"paid vacation\". We hear vague ad-lib mutterings on the soundtrack indicating a friendly atmosphere, and we see stock footage of a C-130 transport flying to Antarctica and ice floes on the surface of the sea. Then, at a New Zealand airport, we see X, in a uniform, at a newsstand reading of Kennedy's assassination.  The banner headline of an \"Extra\" edition of The Christchurch Star screams out \"KENNEDY SHOT DEAD.\" X It wasn't until I was on my way back in New Zealand that I read of the President's murder.  That was 2 in the afternoon the next day New Zealand time, but already the papers had the entire history of an unknown 24-year- old man, Oswald - a studio picture, detailed biographical data, Russian information - and were pretty sure of the fact he'd killed the President alone, although it took them four more hours to charge him with the murder in Texas.  It felt as if, well, a cover story was being put out like we would in a black op. Back at the Pentagon office, we see X returning and meeting Y.  The atmosphere is cordial, but Y is slightly different from before - more harried, more nervous.  He turns away to light a cigarette, he doesn't want the usual conversation. X Anyway, after I came back I asked myself why was I, the chief of special ops, selected to travel to the South Pole at that time to do a job that any number of others could have done? One of my routine duties if I had been in Washington would've been to arrange for additional security in Texas.  The Secret Service is relatively small, and by custom the military will augment them.  I checked it out when I got back and sure enough, I found out someone had told the 112th Military Intelligence Group at 4th Army Headquarters at Fort Sam Houston to \"stand down\" that day, over the protests of the unit Commander, a Colonel Reich... We see an outdoor shot of the Texas Army Headquarters on a day in 1963.  Inside, on the same day, Col. Reich is on the phone, puzzled. X Now this is significant, because it is standard operating procedure, especially in a known hostile city like Dallas, to supplement the Secret Service.  Even if we had not allowed the bubbletop to be removed from the limousine, we'd've put at least 100 to 200 agents on the sidewalks, without question!  There'd already been several attempts on de Gaulle's life in France.  Only a month before in Dallas UN Ambassador Adlai Stevenson had been spit on and hit. We'd have arrived days ahead of time, studied the route, checked all the buildings... We never would've allowed all those wide-open empty windows overlooking Dealey... never...  We would have had our own snipers covering the area.  The moment a window went up they'd have been on the radio.  We would've been watching the crowds - packages, rolled up newspapers, a coat over an arm, never would have let a man open an umbrella along the way - Never would've allowed that limousine to slow down to 10 miles per hour, much less take that unusual curve at Houston and Elm.  You would have felt an Army presence in the streets that day, but none of this happened.  It was a violation of the most basic protection codes we have. And it is the best indication of a massive plot in Dallas.  Who could have best done that?  People in my business, Mr. Garrison.  People like my superior officer could've told Col. Reich, \"Look - we have another unit coming from so and so providing security.  You'll stand down.\"  That day, in fact, there were some individual Army Intelligence people in Dallas and I'm still trying to figure out who and why.  But they weren't protecting the client.  One of them, by the way, was caught in the Book Depository after police sealed it off. In Dealey Plaza, 1963, we see an Army intelligence man taking a shot with a Minolta camera. X Army Intell had a \"Harvey Lee Oswald\" on file, but all those files have been destroyed.  Many strange things were happening that day, and Lee Harvey Oswald had nothing to do with them.  We had the entire Cabinet on a trip to the Far East.  We had a third of a combat division returning from Germany in the air above the United States at the time of the shooting, and at 12:34 P.M., the entire telephone system went dead in Washington for a solid hour, and on the plane back to Washington, word was radioed from the White House Situation Room to Lyndon Johnson that one individual performed the assassination.  Does that sound like a bunch of coincidences to you, Mr. Garrison?  Not for one moment.  The cabinet was out of the country to get their perception out of the way. The troops were in the air for possible riot control.  The phones didn't work to keep the wrong stories from spreading if anything went wrong with the plan.  Nothing was left to chance.  I bet you there were even backup teams and cars on the other side of the underpass in the event that Kennedy got through wounded. They would have moved in with vehicles like they did with de Gaulle.  He could not be allowed to escape alive. The camera is on Jim, listening.  This information is much greater than he ever envisioned, and he is stunned.  X pauses. X I never though things were the same after that.  Vietnam started for real.  There was an air of, I don't know, make-believe in the Pentagon and the CIA.  Those of us who'd been in secret ops since the beginning knew the Warren Commission was fiction, but there was something... deeper, uglier.  And I knew Allen Dulles very well.  I briefed him many a time in his house.  He was also General Y's benefactor.  But for the life of me I still can't figure out why Dulles was appointed to investigate Kennedy's death.  The man who had fired him.  I got out in '64.  I retired from the U.S. Air Force.",

Now they had the people, the equipment, bases and the motivation... check out an old CIA man, Bill Harvey - ran something called \"Executive Action\", which carried out foreign assassinations.  Harvey was also involved with the fake defection program that got Oswald into Russia. Check out the Cabell brothers. Interesting links to this case.

And then back to Jim at Arlington Cemetery reliving it... only the enormity of past evil can prepare him to confront present evil.  In a strange way, it reassures him. X ...don't underestimate the budget cuts Kennedy called for in March of '63 either - close to 52 military installations in 25 states, 21 overseas bases, you're talking big money.  You know how many helicopters have been lost in Vietnam?  About three thousand so far.  Who makes them?  Bell Helicopter.  Who owns Bell?  Bell was near bankruptcy when the First National Bank of Boston approached the CIA about developing the helicopter for Indochina usage. How 'bout the f-111 fighters?  General Dynamics in Fort Worth.  Who owns that?  Find out the defense budget since the war began.  $75 going on a hundred billion ... $200 billion'll be spent before it ends.  In 1950 it was $13 billion.  No war, no money. Sometimes I think the organizing principle of any society is for war. The authority of the state over it's people resides in it's war powers. Even Eisenhower - military hero of WWII - warned us about it: \"beware the military - industrial complex\", he said.  Kennedy wanted to end the Cold War in his second term.  He wanted to call of the moon race in favor of cooperation with the Soviets. He signed a treaty with the Soviets to ban nuclear testing, he refused to invade Cuba in '62, and he set out to withdraw from Vietnam.  But that all ended on November 22, 1963.",

The time frame of 5.6 seconds established by the Zapruder film left no possibility of a fourth shot from Oswald's rifle, but the shot or fragment that left a superficial wound on Tague's cheek had to come from a bullet that missed the car entirely.  Now they had two bullets that hit, and we know one of them was the fatal head shot.  So a single bullet remained to account for all seven wounds in Kennedy and Connally.  But rather than admit to a conspiracy or investigate further, the Commission chose to endorse the theory put forth by an ambitious junior counsellor, Arlen Specter. One of the grossest lies ever forced on the American people, we've come to know it as the \"magic bullet\" theory.",

It then moves upward in order to leave Kennedy's body from the front of his neck - his neck wound number two - where it waits 1.6 seconds, turns right and continues into Connally's body at the rear of his right armpit - wound number three.  Then, the bullet heads downward at an angle of 27 degrees, shattering Connally's fifth rib and leaving from the right side of his chest - wounds four and five. The bullet continues downward and then enters Connally's right wrist - wound number six - shattering the radius bone.  It then enters his left thigh - wound number seven - from which it later falls out and is found in almost \"pristine\" condition on a stretcher in a corridor of Parkland Hospital. (he shows a mock-up of the \"pristine\" bullet) That's some bullet.  Anyone who's been in combat can tell you never in the history of gunfire has there been a bullet like this. (the court laughs) The Army Wound Ballistics experts at Edgewood Arsenal fired some comparison bullets and not one of them looked anything like this one. (he shows mock-ups of comparison bullets) Take a look at CE 856, an identical bullet fired through the wrist of a human cadaver - just one of the bones smashed by the magic bullet.  Yet the government says it can prove this with some fancy physics in a nuclear laboratory.  Of course they can.  Theoretical physics can prove an elephant can hang from a cliff with it's tail tied to a daisy, but use your eyes - your common sense - (he holds the bullet) Seven wounds, skin, bone.  This single bullet explanation is the foundation of the Warren Commission's claim of a lone assassin.  And once you conclude the magic bullet could not create all seven of those wounds, you have to conclude there was a fourth shot and a second rifleman. And if there was a second rifleman, there had to be a conspiracy, which we believe involved the accused Clay Shaw.  Fifty-one witnesses, gentlemen of the jury, thought they heard shots coming from the Grassy Knoll, which is to the right and front of the President.",

In later years Bobby Kennedy and Martin Luther King, men whose commitment to change and to peace would make them dangerous to men who are committed to war, would follow, also killed by such \"lonely, crazed men,\" who remove our guilt by making murder a meaningless act of a loner.  We have all become Hamlets in our country - children of a slain father - leader whose killers still possess the throne.  The ghost of John F. Kennedy confronts us with the secret murder at the heart of the American dream. He forces on us the appalling questions:  Of what is our Constitution made?  What is our citizenship, and more, our lives worth?  What is the future of a democracy where a President can be assassinated under conspicuously suspicious circumstances while the machinery of legal action scarcely trembles?  How many political murders, disguised as heart attacks, cancer, suicides, airplane and car crashes, drug overdoses will occur before they are exposed for what they are?",

There won't be such familiar signs as swastikas.  We won't build Dachaus and Auschwitzes.  We're not going to wake up one morning and suddenly find ourselves in gray uniforms goose - stepping off to work ... \"Fascism will come,\" Huey Long once said. \"in the name of anti-fascism\" - it will come in the name of your security - they call it \"National Security,\" it will come with the mass media manipulating a clever concentration camp of the mind.

The President was murdered by a conspiracy planned in advance at the highest levels of the United States government and carried out by fanatical and disciplined Cold Warriors in the Pentagon and CIA's covert operations apparatus - among them Clay Shaw here before you.

All these documents are yours - the people's property - you pay for it, but because the government considers you children who might be too disturbed to face this reality, because you might lynch those involved, you cannot see these documents for another 75 years.  I'm in my 40's, so I'll have shuffled off this mortal coil by then, but I'm already telling my 8 year - old son to keep himself physically fit so that one glorious September morning in 2038 he can walk into the National Archives and find out what the CIA and the FBI knew.  They may even push it back then.  It may become a generational affair, with questions passed down from father to son, mother to daughter, in the manner of the ancient runic bards.  Someday somewhere, someone might find out the damned Truth.  Or we might just build ourselves a new Government like the Declaration of Independence says we should do when the old one ain't working - maybe a little farther out West.",

You have a lot to think about. Going back to when we were children, I think most of us in this courtroom thought that justice came into being automatically, that virtue was its own reward, that good would triumph over evil.  But as we get older we know that this just isn't true. \"The frontier is where a man faces a fact.\"  Individual human beings have to create justice and this is not easy because truth often presents a threat to power and we have to fight power often at great risk to ourselves.  People like Julia Ann Mercer, S.M. Holland, Lee Bowers, Jean Hill, and Willie O'Keefe have come forward and taken that risk. (he produces a stack of letters) I have here some $8000 in these letters sent to my office from all over the country - quarters, dimes, dollar bills from housewives, plumbers, car salesmen, teachers, invalids ... These are the people who cannot afford to send money but do, these are the ones who drive the cabs, who nurse in the hospitals, who see their kids go to Vietnam. Why?  Because they care, because they want to know the truth - because they want their country back, because it belongs to us the people as long as the people got the guts to fight for what they believe in!  The truth is the most important value we have because if the truth does not endure, if the Government murders truth, if you cannot respect the hearts of these people... (shaking the letters) ...then this is no longer the country in which we were born in and this is not the country I want to die in... And this was never more true than for John F. Kennedy whose murder was probably the most terrible moment in the history of our country.  You the people, you the jury system, in sitting in judgement on Clay Shaw, represent the hope of humanity against Government power.  In discharging your duty, in bringing the first conviction in this house of cards against Clay Shaw, \"Ask not what your country can do for you, but what you can do for your country.\" Do not forget your young President who forfeited his life.  Show the world this is still a government of the people, for the people, and by the people.  Nothing as long as you live will ever be more important. (he stares into the camera) It's up to you.",

It surfaced in the 1970's that the Army had long been conducting surveillance and keeping files on thousands of private citizens in the name of national security.  The prime targets were dissident-left-wingers of the kind Oswald appeared to be. ** CLAY SHAW died in 1974 of supposed lung cancer.  No autopsy was allowed. ** WILLIAM SULLIVAN, Assistant Director of the FBI, died in the early morning hours of November 9,177 when he was mistaken for a deer in an open field in New Hampshire.  Shortly before his death, Sullivan had a preliminary hearing with the HSCA. ** GEORGE DE MOHRENSCHILDT committed suicide just hours after HSCA investigator Gaeton Fonzi located him. ** In November, 1969 JIM GARRISON was re-elected to a third term as District Attorney of Orleans Parish.  In June of 1971, he was arrested by Federal Agents on charges of allowing payoffs on pinball gambling by organized crime.  In September of 1973, after defending himself in Federal Court, he was quickly found not guilty of charges that appear to have been framed against him.  Less than six weeks later, he was narrowly defeated for a fourth term as District Attorney. ** In 1978, Garrison was elected Judge of the Louisiana State Court of Appeal in New Orleans.  He was re - elected in 1988. To this date, he has brought the only public prosecution in the Kennedy killing. ** ELIZABETH and Jim were divorced in 1978.  He now lives in the same house he lived in with Elizabeth.  She lives a block away.  Their five children are grown. ** SOUTHEAST ASIA: 58,000 American lives, 2 million Asian lives, $220 billion spent, 10 million Americans air - lifted there by commercial aircraft, more than 5,000 helicopters lost, 6.5 million tons of bombs dropped. ** A Congressional Investigation from 1976 - 1979 found a \"probable conspiracy\" in the assassination of John F. Kennedy and recommended the Justice Department investigate further. As of 1991, the Justice Department has done nothing.  The files of the House Select Committee on Assassinations are locked away until the year 2029.
