We can see the rear of a number of assorted houses and small apartment buildings whose fronts face on the next cross-town street, sharply etched by the morning sun. Some are two stories high; others three; some have peaked roofs, others are flat. There is a mixture of brick and wood and wrought iron in the construction. The apartment buildings have fire escapes, the others do not. The neighborhood is not a prosperous one, but neither is it poor. It is a practical, conventional dwelling place for people living on marginal incomes, luck -- or hope and careful planning. The summer air is motionless and heavy with humid heat. It has opened windows wide, pushed back curtains, lifted blinds and generally brought the neighborhood life into a sweltering intimacy. Yet, people born and bred to life within earshot and eye glance of a score of neighbors have learned to preserve their own private worlds by uniformly ignoring each other, except on direct invitation.",

They sit limply looking at each other with bedraggled and weary expressions which show they enjoyed very little sleep in the heat of the night.",

Her stomach, navel, and the lower part of her chest are naked. Just below her breasts, the curtain, partly drawn, has thrown a deep shadow which extends upward, hiding her breasts, shoulders and head. Two pieces of toast pop up in the toaster. She takes them out, butters them. Then she turns around and bends over another table on which stands an automatic coffee-maker. She picks up the coffee-maker, and swings back to the table to sit down. She does this so deftly that her breasts are never exposed, but hidden by the fan as she sits down. The fan moves back and forth as she pours coffee, far enough to reveal that she wears no bra, but not far enough to fulfill the exciting promise of her lack of clothes.",

They at least have all of Jeff's attention. Then they spread the robes in front of them, and lie down on the roof, and out of sight. Jeff seems a little disappointed.",

The girl, now dressed in dark and revealing leotard, and ballet slippers, has just turned away from a portable record player. She begins the first graceful movement of a modern ballet interpretation. She gracefully moves across the room to the rhythm of the music and dance, toward the ice box. With her feet still moving, she throws open the door, and then rhythmically moving back to the center of the room, gnaws the chicken bone, occasionally waving it in the air as part of the choreography. She now twirls over toward a table at the other side of the room on which is an open package of bread slices, some butter nearby. With swaying body, she puts down the chicken leg, and gracefully and rhythmically butters a slice of bread. She picks up both bread and chicken leg and continues her interpretive dance, alternately munching the bread and butter and chicken leg.",

It comes from the apartment with the studio window which we saw earlier where the man was shaving and listening to the radio. The short, balding man sits at the piano playing a few notes, then transferring them by pencil to notepaper on the piano rack. He continues this process, fighting the interference of the ballet music. The opening bars of his melody are beautiful and ear-catching. It is slow, hard work, and the ballet music finally becomes such an interference that he gives up and walks to the window to look down toward the dancer's apartment. He stands by a table at the window which is littered with records, the morning coffee cup, unwashed, the remains of breakfast, old newspapers, song sheets, etc. He takes a cigarette out of his mouth, looks for an ash tray, and ends up putting it out in the coffee cup. He then returns to the piano and begins picking out the melody the dancer is playing on her record player.",

Pointing to a wristwatch, she seems to be saying something such as \"You should have been home two hours ago! I could be lying here dying for all you'd know -- or care!\" The man stops short of the bed, makes gestures of trying to placate her, but she goes on scolding.

He is easy to identify through the color of his garish necktie. In one hand the man carries a small garden hoe and rake, and in the other a pair of trimming shears. He goes to a small patch of flowers, perhaps three feet square. They are beautiful, multi-colored three foot high zinnias. He kneels down, inspects them, touches them affectionately and with some pride. His anger seems to have left him, replaced by the kind of peace that flowers bring many people. He stands up, carefully hoes the ground, them rakes it. Then he snips a few leaves off the lower parts of the plant. Finally, he waters them.",

A shade has gone up, and a man, obviously a caretaker is raising a window with some effort. Having accomplished this, he turns back into the room, and we now see him approach a young man and woman who are standing just inside the doorway. He hands a key to the young man, and then obligingly brings in two suitcases which he places on the floor beside them. He gives them a studied, but agreeable nod, then departs. We now see that the girl has a small hat with a veil, and an ornate corsage pinned to her light blue tailored suit. The boy, who like the girl is perhaps twenty years old, wears a dark blue serge suit and a grey felt hat. He takes off the hat, and scales it over to a nearby chair. Quickly they are in each other's arms, kissing passionately, crushing the girl's corsage and pushing her hat back a little. They part, the boy laughs nervously, and takes a furtive glance out toward the corridor. He looks back into the room, and beckons her to come out. She follows him wonderingly. For a moment, both are lost from sight. When they reappear, he is carrying her in his arms, over the threshold. He sets her down, closes the door, and they kiss again. They part, still holding hands and looking into each other's eyes. Then slowly, and significantly, she looks toward the open window. He releases her hands, goes to the window and pull down the shade, as she is reaching upward with both hands to unpin her hat.",

She picks up a lipstick and proceeds to paint her lips carefully. Having completed her make-up, she takes off her glasses and surveys her face in the mirror. She stands up, swings the skirt of her dress around, admires herself in the mirror. She is quite flat-chested, and the dress hangs unattractively. She lifts her chin, gives one last look, and turns toward her living room. As if she's preparing to meet someone.",

The ice box is now skillfully concealed by a large Chinese screen. All kitchen utensils have been put away, replaced by more attractive effects, and lamp light softens the surroundings. Miss Torso is now wearing a cocktail dress, which shows off her figure to great advantage, especially when she leans toward three assorted men to offer them a plate of hors d' oeuvres. She is the perfect hostess, animated, charming, and with an added personal touch for each guest. She is behaving with a sophistication which was not apparent when we first saw her in the morning. Her every movement is followed admiringly by the eyes of the three men -- one wearing black tie, with a touch of grey in his hair, a Long Island socialite -- a young rather handsome, actor in grey flannel suit -- and last, a bright, pleasant, young man who might possibly be from Wall street, wearing a blue-pin-striped suit. The latter two are engaged in an animated conversation. The young man in the grey suit is showing the other young man some newspaper cuttings he's taken from his pocket. Miss Torso sees that the cocktail glass of the third man is empty. She takes it over to the window, and starts to fill it. The man in the tuxedo follows her over, with a casual glance toward the other two. He stands beside her as she makes the drink. He looks at his watch with some impatience, and makes a side comment to her as to the lateness of the time. She turns, gives him a light kiss on his cheek, as if she's telling him to be patient. Instead of pacifying him, it makes him more amorous, and he puts an arm around her shoulder an plants a heavy kiss on her cheek. She turns to face him, they look into each other's eyes a moment, and she allows herself to be kissed on the lips -- but only long enough so as to attract the attention of the other two men. With a little admonishing look, she moves away from him, and makes him rejoin the other two.",

In the bedroom, his wife has become aware of the call. Quietly she moves the tray, gets out of bed, and goes to the bedroom door to listen. The wall hides her from our view. Then suddenly, she apparently opens the door, because the living room, we see her arm suddenly appear, pointing at the man and the telephone. He speaks quickly into the phone, and hangs up. His face is flushed and angry as he goes toward the bedroom. In the bedroom his wife appears walking back to the bed, followed by the husband. She is laughing, and he is answering her in angry tones. She climbs in bed laughing. The more she laughs, the more angry he gets, and the harder she laughs.

THE CAMERA PANS OVER and we see that Miss Torso has returned from her date. She is wearing a three- quarter length coat over her evening dress. She is inside, with the door two-thirds closed, but she leans out to kiss someone goodnight. Then it takes some coaxing to get the door completely closed. She turns the key in the lock. She listens a moment then comes to the center of the room. She takes her coat off and drapes it over chair. She removes the screen in front of the ice box, then opens the ice box. She searches it for something to eat; finds a big piece of pumpkin pie. She closes the ice box. She starts to eat the pie as she moves in the direction of the bathroom. Stopping a moment, she puts the piece of pie on a table, and proceeds to take off her dress. Undoing the zippers, she slides it over her head as she passes into the bathroom. The dress is thrown on a nearby chair, and the bare arm picks up a piece of pie. She is now in the bathroom. We see her slip down the brassiere straps, but the window does not permit us to see any lower. As she munches on the pie, she pulls out a few pins holding up her hair, which she proceeds to brush rhythmically. She turns and moves down her bare back.",

Satisfied, she takes off the glasses, and examines her face as a whole, through squinting eyes. She has faded good looks, has fairly nice clothes, but is badly in need of advice on hair dressing. Her hair-do makes her seem middle-aged. She reaches for a tall glass of liquor next to her, and takes a long drink. Putting the glass down, she squints to see if she has disturbed the lipstick. Unable to see clearly, she puts on the glasses again, looks, and touches up her lips slightly. She puts her glasses in a handbag, then stands to put out the lights. She walks into the living room, finishing the drink. The long-focus lens moves with her. She goes straight for a bottle of liquor, and pours out a final neat slug, and tosses it off. Then she leaves the apartment, with a show of determination. She turns out the lights behind her.",

She slips away from his hasty embraces and exploratory kisses with the proper flush of confusion and nervous giggle that seems to say, \"It's quite a surprise you find me so desirable, but me mustn't do anything improper, you know. After all, we're practically strangers -- and what would you think of me?\" She pours a drink for each of them with gestures over-genteel. As she sips her drink and look at him over the rim of the glass, he tosses his off with nervous dispatch. He moves toward her, this time more cautiously. An embrace, a long kiss. She puts her drink down on the edge of the chair. It spills over onto the rug. He begins kissing her cheek, her ear, her neck. Suddenly and fiercely she pushes him away. Slaps him across the face. He moves back with shock as she loudly and emphatically orders him out, out, out. He flushes with anger and embarrassment, and his mouth twists into unpleasant shapes as he slaps degrading words back at her, telling her what she is. She screams at him to get out. He leaves, slamming the door behind him. She goes back dumbly to the spilled liquor, makes a futile effort to clean it up, and the collapses onto the rug sobbing hard enough to shake her whole body.",

He turns, facing the window, looking down at the bag. He looks up in the direction of the living room. Then suddenly his whole frame stiffens, his head turns a little further around to his right. He is looking directly at Lisa who is out of our sight in the corner of the bedroom. He holds out the bag, and without moving, starts to question the unseen Lisa. He takes a little step forward, and his head begins to turn slightly to the left as Lisa begins to emerge into the living room, backing away slowly. By her gestures, and nervous laughter, she appears to be offering a lame excuse for being found in his apartment. He comes towards her, and enters the living room as well. Lisa edging toward the door, points to it as she apparently argues with him as to the way she came in. He points to the window. She makes one more step toward the door, but Thorwald reaches out quickly and grabs her by the wrist. He twists it brutally, and flings her sideways into the sofa beneath the window. Her head snaps back against the head rest. With his right hand he throws the handbag across the room in anger, and with his left open-palmed he demands something from Lisa. Slowly her right hand comes up and opens. He takes the jewelry from her, looks at it for a surprised moment, puts it into his coat pocket. He reaches down with both hands, and by the wrists jerks her to her feet. He is talking viciously to her. We can hear Lisa calling out faintly: \"Jeff! Jeff!\" Thorwald suddenly looks out at the neighborhood. He realizes that somebody might be watching him. He drags her across the room, reaches up with one arm, and the lights go off. The faint light from the bedroom illuminates their struggle, but not clearly.",
