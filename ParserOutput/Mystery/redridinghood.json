He's running so fast he nearly falls into the RUSHING RIVER that crosses his path. He quickly looks for a way to cross. The river is gorged and the water is moving fast. Then, in a flash of lightning, he spots it -- A fallen tree spans the river. The Knight hurries to it. The bark is smooth and slick from the rain. He can't stand on it. He has to crawl. He edges out on his hands and knees, his eyes flicking nervously at the waters surging underneath him. He has almost made it across... ... when he hears a LOW SNARL. He freezes. Looks back. Lightning FLASHES. The Figure, still obscured to us, stands on the riverbank behind the Knight. It GROWLS. The Knight tries to crawl away, but slips and nearly falls in the river. Then suddenly, the tree beneath him begins to move. He hangs on for his life and looks back. The Figure is on the tree behind him, slowly closing in. He starts to crawl, slips again. No way he can get away. He looks down into the racing river waters. Then back at the Figure closing in. The choice is clear. The Fat Knight dives headfirst off the tree -- -- but he never hits the water. Something grabs him by the legs and stops him short. He cries out and looks up at the thing that is dangling him helplessly above the water. He weeps. Then, abruptly -- -- he is yanked up out of sight.",

It makes the wolf that they killed look like a chihuahua. But there's something about its face that isn't canine at all, but ghoulishly human as it HOWLS at the moon. Suddenly, a group of Villagers throw off their cloaks, revealing themselves to be Solomon's armored Soldiers. Each of them draws a gleaming sword and points it at the Wolf. They've been lying in wait and now they have it surrounded. The Wolf SNARLS at them. (CONTINUED)",

They bravely press the attack, but they're no match for the beast. It swats one of them right through the wall of a nearby cottage. The ambush has backfired. The Carpenter sees Claude on the ground and picks him up, trying to help. Claude fights and screams, but the Carpenter carries him away. Roxanne starts toward him -- -- and is bowled over by Solomon's horse. Solomon grabs the stake with the wolf's head atop it and charges at the Wolf, wielding the stake like a lance. The Wolf catches the stake in its jaws, throwing Solomon off his horse. Just as the Wolf is about to pounce on him, but more Soldiers join the fight. The Wolf sees them coming. It attacks Solomon's horse, biting its neck and dragging it to the ground. As the Soldiers close in -- -- the Wolf spins around, hurling the injured horse at them, knocking them down like bowling pins. Another Soldier tries to attack the Wolf from behind, but it smacks him aside with its tail and then smashes him to the ground with one enormous paw.
