Two men in ill-fitting suits get out and look around cautiously. The first is TUCCI, a big bellied, white haired menace. The other is HIGHAM, lean and bad skinned. They are bodyguards and give it away by their every careful move. They turn back to the elevator and motion to someone inside. Out walks SAUL BERG, a slightly overweight man in his forties with an open collar silk shirt and a thick gold chain on his hairy chest. He carries a LARGE ALUMINUM BRIEFCASE. He lets his guards do the worrying. He walks straight to his car. Saul passes McManus under the hood of the Honda. He takes out his keys and pushes a button on his key chain. The Mercedes beeps three times and tells Saul his alarm is off. Tucci keeps an eye on McManus. Higham watches Saul. McManus pretends to tinker with the car's engine. He has put a pistol just inside the grill and keeps it within reach. The van on the other side of the garage starts and pulls out of the spot. It cruises over toward the Mercedes. Tucci sees the van. He and Higham are suddenly busy trying to keep track. They hear laughing behind them and turn around.",

He can just make out police cars coming in the distance. BANG Verbal hears a shot from the deck of the boat. He turns in time to see the man in the suit running across the deck toward the gangway.
