SHARON'S BEDROOM - NIGHT (HOURS LATER) Sharon is dressed for bed in a sleep shirt, lying on the bed, surrounded by old photos and a couple of photo albums from her girlhood. In a vase on her bed table is Catch's rose. Sharon is feeling blue, looking at her young self within the family that has shut her out. She closes the book, angry at herself for nearly crying. She sits up and catches sight of the rose and rummages in the drawer and pulls out the tape with Catch's phone number on it. She's very conflicted    about this. She puts the tape down, but it sticks to    her fingers. She tears it off and tries to throw it onto    the table, but it hangsoff her thumb. She sighs and     steels herself and dialsthe number.

We hear what he hears: the VOICES of his wife, his son, murmurings. We're not sure of the words, even laughter. Catch's eyes snap open, jolted out of sleep, but the VOICES don't stop, and he suddenly sits up. The VOICES FADE as he catches his breath, gulping air. He tries to calm down. In a moment, he rises and moves to Sharon's bedroom. INT. BEDROOM - MORNING He comes to the side of the bed and sees that she is asleep. He sits on the bed and studies her, his dark thoughts dissipating as he watches her sleep, his eyes going deep. In a moment he begins to raise a hand to brush her cheek -- the way awakened her before -- but he stops before touching her. Instead, he brings his face close to her and lightly kisses her. She stirs. He kisses her again. She opens her eyes. They stare at each other. She raises a limp hand and touches his face. He begins to come close, slowly, for another kiss. She welcomes it. They kiss on the mouth, very tenderly. They kiss again -- deeper. They kiss again, and she holds him, and he moves fully onto the bed, lying over her and supporting his weight on his elbows and kissing and kissing and letting go for once, hungry for her because she is in his heart now, and she is a salvation, and there is a moment when they both pause and stare clear-eyed, acknowledging what they are doing, and both of them abandon their fear and pain and begin to smile, and they make love that way, smiling, as we slowly...",

We PAN during this slow number and ARRIVE AT a few dancing couples, including Sharon and Catch who mostly just hold each other and sway. When their eyes meet, there is a lot of deep pleasure there. The music ends. The small crowd applauds. Couples head back to the tables, but the little band goes right into a more up-tempo but still earthy blues. Sharon stops and pulls Catch back onto the dance floor. He smiles and follows.

She rises, finds a robe and slips it on, calling out softly for Catch. INT. LIVING ROOM - MORNING Sharon sees that Catch and Bob are gone. She drifts to the window, looks at the day, looks down at the street -- and she sees them. SHARON'S POV She sees Catch and Bob on their way into the park across the street from the building. ON SHARON She smiles and moves into the bedroom to dress. EXT. CITY PARK - DAY (MINUTES LATER) Catch is walking Bob in the park, but is also checking for someone, studying the playground. He begins walking toward the swings. ANGLE - SANDBOX Tommy, Catch's neighbor, is playing in the sand with a metal truck. Catch walks up to Tommy, carrying a bulging plastic bag -- but Tommy's attention is on Bob, and pets the big, friendly dog.

The church is not full, but perhaps 50 people sit in the front pews, watching the ceremony at the altar: The priest, Mr. and Mrs. Pogue, altar boys. Sharon moves forward and slips into a pew a few back from the altar. The slight disturbance of people sliding over to let her in causes a few people to glance over. (CONTINUED) 114.

He hesitates. We see the price he's paying and the determination. He walks through the gate. EXT.

He is fighting his way through this, moving closer to one of the buildings. He is nearly alone on the chapel grounds, and, as he reaches the sheltered wall of this building, he is alone.
