His shoulders strain under the weight of so much repetition. His eyes are touched by regret. The lines in his face reveal an emerging disenchantment not so much with the world as with himself. Walking at his side is a WOMAN, 30, attractive and bright. Her name is unimportant because so many have come before her and, if the past prevails, so many will come after.

All I could think about was what I'd lose if she died. And then one night... she was in really bad pain... I stopped thinking about myself for a second and I thought about her.

TAXI -- AFTERNOON As the cab bounces down a cobblestone Village street, Wills and Charlotte stare straight ahead, each following the tortuous path of his own thoughts. Slowly, Charlotte steals a sidelong look at him. His face is tense, ashen, and unreadable -- CHARLOTTE Hey. Wills slowly turns his head. She smiles sweetly -- CHARLOTTE Look on the bright side: if I weren't sick, there's no way we could hang out together. (off his look) I'm serious. You'd be scared of hurting me and I'd be scared you were just using me for my perfect young body. He can't help but smile. Encouraged, she moves closer -- CHARLOTTE And then our friends would say we were just into each other for weird psychological reasons. You know, because I'm looking for a daddy substitute and you're looking for someone you can feel superior to so you won't have to confront how scared you are of real intimacy -- and, of course, they'd be right and eventually we'd break up. (beat) But since I'm so sick it doesn't really matter what deep-seated weirdness has brought us together because there's no way we can possibly screw each other over... or up... because that takes time. And I don't have much left. The cab comes to a stop in front of her brownstone. She smiles archly, savoring the irony -- CHARLOTTE So considering everything, don't you think we should just sort of chill out, forget I'm sick, and enjoy what we have... right now... no strings... just this... until it ends? 'Cause that's really all I have to offer. Wills grimly appreciates the irony.",

He idly glances up as a STREAM OF TOURISTS moves past. He is about to look away when his eye catches someone. It is Lisa, the young woman who spoke to Charlotte at the benefit. Around her neck she wears a chain bearing a Met employee photograph I.D. She carries a take-out coffee. Wills FOLLOWS HER, agitated and curious. He sees her pass through a set of glass doors into the Watson Research Library. He hurries over to the doors just in time to see her disappear behind a bank of card catalogues. Wills notices a sign at the door that forbids entry to the public. He hesitates, then enters. He speaks to the first person he sees -- a ROTUND FEMALE LIBRARIAN IN HER 60'S. He stops and asks a question about Lisa. She nods. Wills is shaken by the answer. He stares into the middle distance, wondering what to do, his mind racing. The librarian, a little nervous now, reminds him that he is not allowed in the library. He snaps to, thanks her, and moves away. But then he stops, takes out a BUSINESS CARD, and returns to the librarian. He is about to hand it to her, but then he thinks better of it. Flustered, he thanks her again and exits. The librarian looks after him, confused and a little apprehensive.",

His face, though still beautiful, has gracefully turned the corner into middle age. Walking at his side is his daughter, Lisa, now well along in her pregnancy -- LISA Actually, to be honest, Peter's more than a little freaked. I mean, how could he not be? He's twenty-six.
