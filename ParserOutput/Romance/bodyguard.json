FRANK FARMER'S HOUSE - EVENING                        8 SLAM of a CAR DOOR. Frank gets out of a cab with two suitcases. His house is a modest stucco affair on a small lot. He goes up the walk and puts down his suit- cases. He looks at rampant foliage and overgrown grass. Supermarket circulars cover his doorstep. He picks up a few and fishes a bunch of keys from his pocket. A curious neighbor peers from behind a net curtain. As the door opens, we are aware of a further pile of mail inside. Frank's feet push the letters aside and go inside. The door shuts. 10   INT. FARMER'S KITCHEN - NIGHT                              10 Farmer has carefully set a place for himself at the table in a breakfast nook. A bottle of red wine is open with a glass beside it. At the stove he stirs and flavors a Boeuf Bourgignon and reads a Time magazine. He adds a splash of wine. He lifts the pot from the stove and tries a piece of meat. At the table, he looks at the place setting and absently eats another piece of meat. Finally he sets the pot on the plate and eats from it directly while glancing through the magazine. 11   INT. DRESSING ROOM - CLOSEUP - CORNER OF DRESSING TABLE    11 Lots of people are schmoozing in the dressing room. There's a loud buzz of excited chatter. Hands are stack- ing flowers, good luck messages, cards and cables by the mirror. Through the blur and bustle, we glimpse the doll with its embroidered ribbon message \"RACHEL, WE LOVE YOU.\" Hands casually move it to one side, among the flowers resting on the small portable TV set. On the screen is an image of Rachel performing on stage, acknowledging applause, bowing. The doll EXPLODES, SHATTERING the TV, the MIRROR and the LIGHT BULBS. The SCREEN GOES BLACK, amid SHOUTS, SCREAMS and CONFUSION. TITLES END. 5. 12   EXT. FRANK FARMER'S HOUSE - BACK YARD - DAY                 12 Frank lounges in his shorts under the single tree, sun- glasses on, a glass of iced tea by his side. Strains of \"DON'T WALK AWAY RENEE\" come from a beat-up transistor RADIO. An old-fashioned lawn sprinkler lazily waves water back and forth over the freshly cut grass.  Throwing knives lay scattered nearby. A wooden post is  sticking out of the ground in front of the fence at the back of the yard. BILL DEVANEY, fiftyish, a distinguished-looking black gentleman, stands nearby trying to engage Frank in a conversation that up to this point hasn't been going well. He's Rachel's personal manager.",

FRANK'S POV as he looks over the gate, the wall, the heavy vegetation and the rising grounds beyond. (NOTE: The use of the term FRANK'S POV, is not to be taken simply as a camera direction. Rather, it re- presents a recurring attempt to make the audience see in the special way Frank sees. Frank lives by constant vigilance, heightened awareness. It is his genius and his burden. The audience must be put in the position of looking, searching, scanning with him.) He has a curious sense of being watched, a kind of prick- ling on the back of his neck. As he looks around, a black Toyota 4X4, parked some way down the road, drives rapidly off -- too fast to get a clear look. He watches it go. Frank pulls up   to the gate and gets out of his car. He grabs a bar of   the gate and pulls. The whole gate rattles. Frank    gets back in his car and pushes a button on the intercom   box at the side of the gate. A MAN'S VOICE CRACKLES   out of the BOX. Transmission is terrible.",

He is crouched at the side of the pool with the remote control unit for a foot-long speedboat which is cutting across the water. A nanny sits, some way off, embroidering. Frank's attention is distracted. A heavier BASS MUSICAL BEAT comes from somewhere nearby in the house, another Rachel Marron number, but this time up-tempo and bouncy. Frank follows the sound. 19   INT. FAMILY ROOM - DAY                                     19 Frank walks into the rear of the room that the noise is coming from. It is large and comfortable with plenty of seating, a bar, a wall of stereo gear and a projection booth. It is packed with people, props and video equipment. There is lots of activity, a general air of barely-organized chaos. MUSIC BLARES out. A group of six dancers, is rehearsing an energetic dance number for a music video, directed by their choreographer RORY. Sunlight throws them in a silhouette against the glass wall at the end of the room. A video cameraman circles them, taping the rehearsal, which appears on a large-screen TV behind them. In one corner, a pretty black girl is being pinned into a proposed costume for the video. Several people are stand- ing around, tending to the video and playback gear. All the chairs face the far end of the room and it isn't immediately apparent how many more people are hidden among the big cushions. As Frank sits on the barstool at the back, a large swivel chair turns to reveal Devaney. He waves to Frank and makes his way over to him. On the other side of the room, a brawny, heavyset man in his late thirties rises to look at Frank. He has a twenty inch neck. Devaney signals to him  that everything is all right. The brawny man looks at Frank a moment more, then sits down. Frank looks around the room. A shelf laden with vitamins. Guitars of various makes. A flute. A gold record being used as a coaster. People smoking and chatting through the rehearsal. 12. In one of the chairs, a pretty  woman in her  mid-thirties (NICKI, the woman we saw at the  premiere) is  knitting. She glances occasionally at the  dancers. A   man sits next to a phone busily discussing a  contract with  someone at the other end of the line. The music climaxes and abruptly stops.

Rachel's image appears on the screen, singing softly, intensely, passionately into the camera. WE TRACK INTO the image, as if a little hypnotized by it. ANGLE FRANK Frank sits alone in his room, lit by the glow of the TV, dressed in a business-style blue suit and tie. He's watching Rachel's videos. Scattered around the video player are a collection of other Rachel Marron CD's, tapes and videos. Frank has been noting down lyrics on the yellow legal pad on his lap. Some of the phrases are circled. As he watches, we see a subtle change in his expression. It is as if he really were looking at Rachel for the first time, here, watching her sing. For a second, she seems to be singing to him alone, passionate and vulnerable. He opens a small box and removes a tiny enamelled Russian Orthodox-type cross. He fastens the clasp, checking that it holds, then looks back to the screen. 51   EXT. MARRON ESTATE - NIGHT                                 51 Rachel's SONG PLAYS OVER the moonlit estate. 52   INT.

Rachel is getting dressed for the evening. A hairdresser stands behind her, fussing with her hair. Rachel hears the MUSIC coming from outside and moves to the window. (The hairdresser moves with her, still busy with the brush.) Gazing across the garden, she sees the light in Frank's room and hears her own voice singing out from there too. 53   EXT. MARRON HOUSE - NIGHT                                  53 Frank is showing Henry how to check the underside of the limo with an angled mirror on a stick. Both are crouched beside the vehicle. A noise makes them look up. Rachel, dressed to the nines and looking very sexy, emerges from the house with Spector and Devaney. Spector's carrying a videotape.

Another man climbs the stage on the other side. One of the guards darts out like a ballboy at a tennis match, pushes the fan back and scurries to the far side to resume his vigilance. The crowd is getting even more excited, pressing closer, trying to touch Rachel. The security guards move in, but Rachel gestures for them to back off.

Frank quickly sizes up the scene. He speaks into a SURV KIT microphone in his sleeve. Across the room we see Henry listening, pushing an earpiece to his ear. Henry quickly scurries to an exit. Frank starts moving toward the stage. At that moment, the lucky man Rachel's dancing with grabs her around the waist and spins her gleefully, like the dance partner she has been pretending to be. One of security guards rushes forward to extri- cate her. The spinning man inadvertently bumps hard into the guard and the man loses his grip on Rachel. She flies out of his grasp and tumbles off the front of the stage -- into the adoring arms of a half dozen fans. The audience goes wild. This is the kind of thing Rachel was famous for when she was starting out. The scene resembles a rugby scrum... with Rachel the ball. Frank sees Rachel being passed over the heads of fans -- deeper into the audience. Her dress is ripped and torn apart. The silver headpiece is dislodged and disappears into the crowd. CLOSE ON RACHEL Fear fills her face. She's gone over the edge, literally and figuratively. She's lost control. Tony and the security guards are fighting to get to her, slamming bodies out of the way. In the b.g., the video continues on its serene, uninterrupted way. FRANK'S POV He spots a fire extinguisher in the wings. BACK TO SCENE Frank grabs it and heads to center stage. He aims the extinguisher at the crowd between Rachel and the stage. The chemical foam does its job, scattering fans. Frank leaps onto the floor, kicking a wild-eyed young blond man in the chest as he fights his way to Rachel, taking her in his arms. Tony runs ahead of Frank, knocks a fan off the stage and waves for Frank to follow.",

Slowly holding her he leads her to bed, moving aside some of Rachel's dolls, laid out on the pillows. Her hands go automatically to her dress but they are shaking so badly she cannot undo it. Frank gently does it for her. She willingly allows him to undress her and not a word is spoken between them. As she sits naked still trembling, he pulls down the covers and guides her gently into bed. As he adjusts the covers she reaches up and takes hold of his hand.

The door at the other end of the room slams open and Tony stalks in, soaking wet. He has just made his way home  from the MAYAN and he is boiling. He sights on Frank and  moves toward him fast. Frank just watches until Tony is almost upon him. As Tony reaches out to lift him by his shirt, Frank spins low out of his seat. Tony's legs are knocked out from under him. He lands hard on his back and finds himself looking up at Frank, who holds him down with the chair he was sitting on, like a lion tamer, a leg strut pressed against Tony's throat. Frank looks down at him question- ingly, as if to ask, \"Had enough?\" Tony scowls and nods. Frank lifts the chair away. Tony stands up and faces him. Frank turns away and Tony throws a punch at his head, barely catching him as Frank ducks and moves in under it. He hits Tony twice and throws him against a cabinet. Tony gets up slowly, looks around and grabs a carving knife from a hook on the wall. He holds it in front of him threateningly. Frank shakes his head. He's getting irritated. He picks up the knife he's been using on the peach and flips it in his hand so he's holding it by the blade. With the same fluid motion we've seen earlier, he throws it at Tony. It sticks in the wall an inch from Tony's ear. Tony does a slow take and then lowers his blade. Frank picks up his dirty dish and takes it to the sink. He glances at Tony.",

In the distance, glimpsed through the spinning brushes, Henry talks to a couple of workers as he waits for the limo to be cleaned. Hands appear with a large chamois cloth, moving easily and fast over the hood and windshield. A black in his early twenties is finishing the exterior of the car. A second pair of hands appear.    White hands in rubber gloves. They open the  driver's   door and push a vacuum suction hose inside.  The hands   switch ON the car RADIO, loud. Loud enough to  hear over   the din outside the car. The hose works its way over the   front seats. D.J. (V.O.) ... And here's another biggie from a lady very much in the news these days, Miss Rachel Marron... We see the owner of the hands. It is the young blond man Frank kicked aside at the MAYAN. His name is DAN. His face is impassive. D.J. (V.O.) ... the hit song from the movie... Queen Of The Night... I Have Nothing. The song begins and Rachel's voice fights the din. In the back of the car, Dan's hose probes around, nosing into all the crevices of the upholstery. It sucks up a crumpled pre-signed photograph of Rachel from the gap beside the rear seat. The hose is switched off and the gloved hands retrieve the picture. 77   INT. LOCKER ROOM - WASH-A-RAMA - DAY                         77 Tight, shabby facilities. Dan opens the combination padlock to his locker and deposits the crumpled photo inside. As the hands remove the rubber gloves, the inside of the locker is revealed. Pasted over every inch of the locker are pictures of Rachel Marron. One tabloid shot of her dancing with the word \"whore\" scrawled across it. Taped to a single sheet of white paper in the center, like a holy relic, is the torn scrap of Rachel's dress from the MAYAN. The hands pin up the newly-acquired photo next to it. 62. 84   INT. FBI LABORATORY - DAY                                 84 Special Agent Court is seated next to a white-coated technician. The technician is leaning over one of the neatly pasted-up death threats we have seen earlier. With a scalpel, he lifts the word \"whore\" from out of the message. He sets it on a white sheet, then brings the blade back and scrapes at the residue of the dry glue on the letter.

Rachel wears a scarf and tinted glasses. The combination    goes a long way toward disguising her. They pause at    one of the dis- play windows.

Most of the local TV stations have sent camera crews.    The handheld cameras move among the guests, their bright lights flaring. FLASHBULBS POP. It's a local media event. Frank squints as a quartz light shines straight in his face. A tall, fit, athletic-looking man raises his arms; is cleared by the metal detector. He is GREG PORTMAN. 117   INT.

Sloping gently down from the house to the lake fifty yards away is a broad expanse of lawn.  Snow lies on the ground and in the trees. At the edge of  the lake, a dock and boathouse. An entrance road cuts  out of the trees. A little TERRIER skitters to the edge of the drive BARKING. A van emerges from the trees, tires CRUNCHING through the snow. Frank's father, HERB, steps onto the front porch. He's in his mid-60's, lean, tan and fit. He's wearing a plaid shirt, jeans and cowboy boots. The van stops in front of the house.

Rachel notices a photo of a smiling Henry Kissinger, talking to some female reporters. There standing shoulder-to-shoulder with him, are Frank and Portman. Portman's also smiling at the women, flirting. Frank is in a familiar pose, alert, unsmiling, vigilant. Rachel looks at the two of them for a second.

Two wary, interchangeable animals. Frank  disappears into the fog. When the figure reappears,  Frank is moving faster, closing the gap. The figure, seen in CLOSEUP for the first time, is wear- ing a dark-colored ski mask.  His breath billows out of the mouth hole, whitening in the cool March air. He hears Frank APPROACHING and points his gun in the direction of the FOOTSTEPS.  He does not fire. SILENCE. Frank stops and rests on his haunches. Listening, he hears the intruder move. The sounds have stopped up ahead. Close. The figure peers into the fog, gun up.   He's ready, confident. He waits. Nothing. Frank, from his crouch, does something brand-new. He raises his gun into the fog in a two-handed grip, ready to fire. He holds it easily. And then he does something really strange: Frank closes his eyes. After a beat, we hear MOVEMENT. Frank, eyes still closed, swings his gun 15 degrees and FIRES TWO BLASTS. The man jumps away from a small tree that has splintered six inches from his shoulder. His eyes are wild behind his ski mask. Frightened, he suddenly crashes away in the opposite direction. We FOLLOW. There is ANOTHER SHOT from Frank very close to the man. 176A   INT.

FRANK'S POV For a split second, two running figures f.g. pass and cross leaving a momentary clear line to Portman. ON STAGE Frank FIRES.   ONCE.   TWICE. PORTMAN Frank's bullets hit home. The first slams Portman in the chest, knocking him against the wall. The second hits the CAMERA on his shoulder, EXPLODING it around his face. FEMALE ACADEMY MEMBER Blood spatters her white Armani dress and the shirt- front of her escort. Portman's body slumps forward in her lap, pinning her back in her seat. He's dead. His pistol drops onto a pair of shiny, black leather pumps. ON STAGE Frank holds his aim steady, reluctant to look away. He half turns to Rachel, wincing with the effort. She's unhurt. He has fulfilled his promise to her. Rachel throws her arms around Frank and hugs him, tears streaming down her cheeks.",

He slowly lowers the gun, closes his eyes and lets his head fall onto his chest. ANGLE ON SPECTOR In the midst of the commotion of medics, security men, police and ushers, Spector bends down and gently retrieves the gold envelope and the card bearing Rachel's name. There are splatters of blood on it. He tries to wipe them off with the silk handkerchief from his breast pocket. 220   EXT. THE PANTAGES THEATRE - NIGHT                          220 A chaos of press and public, ambulance and police lights flashing, SIRENS WAILING. ANGLE ON PART OF CROWD Police and paramedics surrounding a man on a stretcher -- it is Frank -- Rachel walks at his side, clutching his hand as he is rushed to an ambulance. Tony, a dressing over his eyes, is also helped out by paramedics. Among the gathered crowd, we focus in on one face. It is Dan, pushed back to the sidelines and unable to see what is happening. He slowly turns and walks away. CAMERA CRANES to a HIGH WIDE SHOT of the scene. 221   EXT. AIRPLANE TARMAC - DAY                                 221 A buffed-out charter turboprop stands on the tarmac as the last pieces of equipment of Rachel's band are loaded aboard from a truck. A limousine pulls up and Rachel gets out with Tony and Court, who is clearly acting as her bodyguard. She greets some members of the band and others who will be part of her entourage. A roadie has her luggage removed from the limo and loaded aboard the plane. Devaney is trying to hurry her on board. Spector is conspicuous by his absence. As Rachel and the others prepare to get onto the plane, Tony, wearing a dark leather eyepatch, reacts to something O.S. Frank approaches from the nearby parking area. He is pale. Under his clothes it can be seen that his torso is still taped. He smiles as Tony. Their handshake becomes a quick abrazo.",
