Judit (forty-eight, looks younger) breathes, impatient. (She is dressed soberly, in a dignified and practical manner). She approaches a window that looks out onto the street. Everything outside is also in darkness. The building in front is just a dark mass. She looks to the end of the street. Almost all the buildings visible from the window are dark, the Gate of Alcala in the background is also not lit. Without turning, she says to Harry:",

From her pocket, she removes a tiny heart made of black nacar shell and rimmed in silver. She opens it. She grabs a small pink pill. She takes it. She glances once more at the stylized design of the Vitra clock. The minute hand nears 8 p.m. On a windowsill (or on the kitchen table) there is an open newspaper. The exposed page displays an article about the dangers of global warming. An international date has been convened for a five minute blackout at 8 p.m. Standing in the kitchen, Judit, poised and tense, looks up at the spot where the clock is. The stillness of all the elements comprising the frame make it seem like a painting. She waits until the seconds hand completes its cycle and it's 8 o'clock sharp. Swiftly, Judit powers the central electrical switchboard, which is in the kitchen. The kitchen lights up, the refrigerator emits its characteristic sound. The lamps in the living room also light up. (Low-hanging lamps that make the light bounce. The house is awash in a special luminous atmosphere  dense, translucent, with darkened zones). All the furniture is flush with the walls. There are some paintings hanging and a rug on the ground, everything is of the kind of quality that denotes good personal taste. Upon the light's return, Judit exhales a profound sigh of relief. She moves toward the window where she was standing earlier and contemplates how, in the building across the way, the windows begin to blink, in square patterns of light.",

At that time, I had him author all the scripts and stories that I wrote. I came up with a standard biography to fill the back flap of his books. He had been a sailor, an industrial spy, the doorman at a Parisian cabaret, a boxer, a waiter and an advertisement hand-double. A self-made man, active and attractive like an English spy, vital, skeptical and sarcastic. For many years, Mateo Blanco and Harry Caine shared the same person, me, but a time came when, all of a sudden, I couldn't be anyone other than Harry Caine. I became my pseudonym. (He applies lotion in front of the mirror, we first see him in front of it, and then, doubled, reflected in it. Then, suddenly, the mirror does not reflect him. Of his two identities he only has one left). Just as I had planned, a heterodox writer and, never better stated, a self-made man, one might even say, \"self-written man\". There was only one detail I had not foreseen, Harry would be a blind writer.",

The camera swirls around his head. At first he hears all the noises, indistinctly mixed, and then he begins to separate them. He selects one he likes, the rest of the sounds of the street disappear or their volume is lowered. Girls, cars, high heels, the smells of different ethnicities. A multi-racial street. Harry selects an odor (the body of a woman, whose aroma appears and disappears), Harry follows it, having also singled out the sound of her heels. He loses them. He finds them again. He walks self-assuredly, without tripping either on the urban furniture or the people. He leans, lightly, on his umbrella, which he uses as a cane. At first glance he doesn't appear blind ... He reaches a pedestrian crossing. Nearby, he recognizes the odor which had attracted him, he follows its trace until he reaches the sidewalk. The odor emanates from a young Girl, just next to him, waiting before the crosswalk. Harry searches with the tip of the umbrella, until he brushes her shoe. He excuses himself, as if the contact had been inadvertent. The girl regards him. Harry then takes one step forward, intent on crossing the street, the cars come very close to him, almost running him over. (A real sense of danger). The light is red for pedestrians. The Girl takes him by the arm, pulling him toward her, frightened.",

How she's dressed, while she traces over him with her glance (When she speaks of her eyes, we see his eyes; when she speaks of her mouth, we see his, etc). Her gaze stops at Harry's crotch.

With his hands, he places a brief caress on each of the parts the Girl has just described. The eyes, the hair, the mouth. He lowers his hands until they fall, spread, on her breasts. It is as though the blind man could gaze at her with his fingers and palms. He rests his head on the Girl's breast, pulls down her bra straps and he begins to savor",

In her early thirties, Lena is dressed soberly, almost excessively so (as if she were attempting to project a maturity, effectiveness and responsibility that she not yet possesses). She is a very beautiful woman, on whose countenance the passing of time has begun to leave its mark. She has a small mole, slightly raised, next to the seam of the lips, and another one on the top edge of the nose. She could do more with her physique, modernize it, but this is not what she aims for. Her face reminds us of one of the heroines of the American film noir, brought up to date. She possesses the turbulent and at once translucent beauty of Gene Tierney and the bored disdain of Linda Darnell (in \"Fallen Angels\"). Lena is a splendid fallen angel. We can't hear what she says, but judging from her reaction, the content of her conversation is dramatic. Her eyes flash with indignation and anger.",

The mother is a small-town woman, dignified and beaten. The shock provoked by the situation has liberated her, if only momentarily, from falling into desperation.

Photographs of the Father in his policeman uniform, next to the Mother. Over the headboard, there is a crucifix on the wall and perhaps a thick, wooden rosary. Religious images on the nighstands. Attention placed on the bedspread, the curtains, the dresser, the closet and the walls. Everything is new, ugly period furniture. The effect generated is of a somber kitsch. Lena opens a dresser drawer, on top of it sits the picture of the father in his policeman uniform, with the Mother. She finds a Star 9mm pistol. She grabs it and tries its weight, the mother sees her and tells her to leave the weapon in its place. (Perhaps at that very moment the mother is injecting the Father with morphine). Cut to. In the dinning hall, Lena hands her mother money so that she can buy food and her father's medications.",

She grabs a dress by a famous designer of the time and puts it on. A few meters away, in the bedroom, Ernesto buttons up his fly, after tucking in his shirt tail. The scene is that of a wealthy couple, who get along. They are preparing to attend a concert. Ernesto is a big fan of classical music. Lena looks rejuvenated and more refined. Her life and her facial skin have both improved since the first time we see her in Martel's office. The moles have disappeared from her face. Her demeanor is still adult, that of a young woman who has experienced life. Ernesto Martel frequently rests his gaze on her, fascinated, it's hard for him to believe that \"such beauty\" belongs to him.",

He is sitting behind a table filled with papers, photographs, books, magazines, an ashtray, pencil and pen holders, etc. At its center, a script lies open, with tons of notes scribbled on the margins of its pages. He is finishing the definitive version of \"Girls and Suitcases\". The casual messiness of the place produces its own aesthetic. The only decorations on the walls, here and there, not following any particular symmetrical rule, are postcards of painters, actors or landscapes, held in place by tacks. There is also a newspaper page that has caught Mateo's attention. Or some astonishing photograph, taken from a magazine. The cover of some magazine. Everything without framing, tacked directly onto the wall. The furniture is pastel, medium-shade green or red, with velvet tapestry, worn and outmoded. The pieces don't match, but they look good together. Judit enters (also fourteen years younger, but this is less obvious. She is a woman unmarked by the march of time.) Mateo is focused on the script's pages. Judit is Mateo's right-hand man, they are accomplices in everything, both professionally and emotionally.",

Ernesto elbows her, Lena raises her head and discovers Mateo, watching her from the door to his office. Mateo's heart churns, it's a cinematographic churn, he feels like James Stewart in \"Vertigo\", when he first sees Kim Novak at the restaurant, with her famous green dress. Time stops for an instant so that Mateo may contemplate this woman's apparition. After this brief hypnotic moment, they introduce themselves, forgetting Ernesto's presence, who then, since no one pays attention to him, introduces himself. Even though she's a bit nervous, one can tell that Lena is a strong and decisive woman. Brunette. Mysterious. Made-up in dark tones that stand out on her pale skin. Refined. She doesn't have the aspect of a comedienne, her presence is too intense, she seems better suited to be the heroine of a film noir (as we've said).

She has also adopted the style of Holy Golithly, her kind heart and that urbane sophistication that characterizes modern girls from rural origins. The only difference is a more visceral quality, Pina (Lena's character) is exalted and Mediterranean, nothing like Hepburn. Her wardrobe is that of a modern girl in `94, she is a professional model for cosmetic products.

(In slow motion, one sees the collision of the tear with the knife, in a cut-in). Hers is a subtly comic sadness. When she is done grinding up the tomatoes she takes a box of sedatives, which she is carrying in her apron's pocket. She throws all the pills into the gazpacho. She keeps two or three for herself. (She may even say out loud, \"These are for me\".) With a wooden spoon, she mixes the orange liquid, even though it only contains red tomatoes.

The decoration, super- luxurious hippie, does not ring untrue to the Island's aesthetic. Consider that Ernesto Senior and Lena are in the bedroom, on the bed, making love luxuriously. There's no hurry, they pay careful attention to all the details. After the final sprint, they both come, satisfied. Or so it seems. Ernesto remains spent on the bed, motionless. Lena gets up and goes to the bathroom. She opens the faucet and lets the water run. Immediately, she is overtaken by vicious retching. On her knees, she vomits into the toilet. After she's done vomiting she gets up and looks at herself in the mirror. She wipes off her mouth and closes the faucet. She looks very pale, the exertion from the vomiting is written on her face. Quickly, she puts some makeup on. Enough to bring some color back to her cheeks and to get rid of the bags under her eyes. Her eyes still glimmer from the tears she's shed. More than in any other sequence, it is here that Lena reveals her talent as an actress. She exits the bathroom, wrapped in an elegant robe, a bit divine- hippie.",

Ernesto asks for the sound to be muted so that the \"translator\" can do her job. The \"lip reader\" tries, as usual, to be \"neutral and inexpressive\", but on this occasion she cannot help but have the violence of the scene affect her.

Short sequences of the minute work done by each of the teams, as if assembling ballet pieces, all of it accompanied by a musical score: The D.P. sets up the lighting for the shoot, the bulbs are lit, the filters applied, the interior of the camera cleaned, the film is loaded. The atmosphere is set. Pina in her bedroom, lying on the bed, with one leg in a cast, is relaxing, breathing deeply. The actress playing Chon jokes around with the costume team, they laugh. But no one pays attention to the others. Edurne, in a close-up, retouches one of Pina's eyes. The mouth as well. Chon stops laughing so that the hair-stylist may shape her hair. All the images are very brief... The score predominates, the ambient sounds of the activities of the different teams is heard more like a whisper. The scene must not last longer than a minute. This set of images serves to abridge time and to indicate that the shooting is in its final days, after a long journey. There will probably not be many images, but less: the bulb that lights, Lena's eye as Edurne retouches it, its blinking, its sadness. Chon's mouth as she speaks without pause, stopping only when lipstick is added. The film loaded, the hair fluffed. Lena lying on the rug in her dressing room, totally motionless, her eyes made-up and closed, doing breathing exercises for relaxation, her leg in a cast, etc. Motor. Action!",

Chon is a Better Midler type, in her 40s, that kind of extroverted woman who at first glance appears chubby but isn't quite so. She is wearing designer clothes, despite the fact that her demeanor is direct and crass. Both of them, Pina and Chon, are tired and hysterical, which each one of them interprets in her own way.

One of the images captures part of a wine-colored rock. Below it, the infinite surface of the black beach, licked by the white foam of the waves. In the backdrop, an immense limestone wall, its surface full of pit holes where the wind circulates. The sequence ends with a close-up of the click of Mateo's camera's shutter, opening and closing like an owl's eye.",

Mateo's hair is longer and he appears more tan, the proximity to nature and the absence of a social life has also affected Magdalena's appearance, now much more savage, but also more serene and more humble. She is dressed in cheap clothing, which she has bought on the island (and which fits her marvelously) and her hair is pulled up into a messy bun. The photograph, enlarged, presides on top of a small table where Mateo writes. The picture is leaning against the wall. It's the only image inside the bungalow. The photograph is a clear metaphor for the mysterious quality of the island as well as of the isolation of Mateo and Lena and of their fusion. While Mateo writes, Lena cleans the dishes or she does the laundry in the bathtub. The two wear T-shirts, comfortable and sporty clothes. (On the tape-deck one hears La Lupe singing: ... \"porque hay un hombre para cada mujer y una mujer para cada hombre, y nosotros somos, nosotros somos... la pareja\" [because there is only one man for each woman and only one woman for each man, and we are, and we are... the couple]). Mateo and Magdalena, the couple. In the bungalow there isn't much furniture; there's a large couch on which they can lie comfortably, a short table, along with the wooden table on which Mateo writes. Some armchair and lamps. And a tape- deck. Cut to.",

DUSK OR NIGHT. 1994 Engulfed by the couch, Mateo and Lena are absorbed watching, on a small television, a broadcast of \"Voyage in Italy\" (Roberto Rossellini's). The scene they are watching is set in a place where a group of men are working on some excavation. The married couple (in the midst of their breakup), played by George Sanders and Ingrid Bergman, is on a tourist trip in that area of Italy and they have gone to visit the excavation. One of the technicians describes the delicate work that is involved in excavating part of a city that had been buried, centuries ago, by the lethal eruption of the Vesuvius. At that moment, the men who are working on the excavation begin, bit by bit, to uncover a couple, a man and a woman, sleeping in an embrace, whom the eruption had taken unaware, leaving them preserved in this position for centuries. Ingrid Bergman cannot stand the sight of this couple calcined in an eternal embrace. She compares it to her own marriage, destroyed by their lack of communication and by the absence of generosity between them. She walks away from the place, unable to contain her tears. The scene affects Magdalena and Mateo as much as it had Ingrid Bergman. Mateo and Lena instinctively embrace each other, seeking refuge in each other, their posture echoes that of the calcined couple. Suddenly, Mateo breaks their embrace. He positions the camera on top of the table where he writes, not far from where the image of the other \"embrace\" sits. He points it toward the couch and he presses the automatic button. And they take a picture together, locked in an embrace.",

Lena is also quite languid, lacking spark, tired and unenthusiastic. (As a comedy, it's without charm and, as a drama, it's uninteresting, that's what the critics said).",
