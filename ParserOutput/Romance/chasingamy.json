We've been everything to each other but intimates.  And now, we'll have been through that together too.  And it won't have to be a total leap for you, because a woman will be involved.  And when it's over, all that aggression you feel toward Alyssa will be gone. Because you'll have shared in something beautiful with the woman I love.  It'll be cathartic.  A true communion.
