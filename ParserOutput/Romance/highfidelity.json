What am I?  Average.  A middleweight.  Not the smartest guy in the world, but certainly not the dumbest.  I've read books like The Unbearable Lightness of Being, Angela's Ashes, and Love in the Time of Cholera, and understood them, I think -- they're about girls, right? -- just kidding -- but I don't like them very much.  My all time top five favorite books are Johnny Cash's autobiography, Snow Crash by Neil Stevenson, Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance, The Trouser Press Guides to Rock, and, I don't know, probably something by Kurt Vonnegut.  I look through the New Yorker when my neighbor's done with it, and I'm not averse to going down to the Fine Arts to watch subtitles films, although on the whole I prefer American films.  Top five being Blade Runner, Cool Hand Luke, the first two Godfathers which we'll count as one, Taxi Driver, and The Shining. I'm okay looking, average height, not skinny, not fat.  My genius, if I can call it that, is to combine a whole load of averageness into one compact frame.  You might say there were millions like me, but there aren't, really: Alot of guys have impeccable music taste but don't read, alot of guys read but are really fat, alot of guys are sympathetic to women but have stupid beards, alot of guys have a Woody Allen sense of humor but look like Woody Allen. Some drink too much, some drive like assholes, some get into fights, or show off money, or do drugs.  I don't do any of these things, really.  If I do okay with women it's not because of the virtues I have, but because of the ugly flaws I don't have... So.  Charlie and I didn't match. After her I was determined to never get out of my league again.",

Charming as Oscar Wilde? Hell no.  Nothing to do with any of that.  Maybe fifty or so have one or more of these attributes, but that still leaves... well, about nine million, give or take fifty.  And they're just men.  Regular guys. We're just guys, because I, even I, am a member of this exclusive, nine million member club.  In fact, Marie is my seventeenth lover. \"How does he do it?\" you ask. \"He wears bad sweaters, he's grumpy, he's broke, he hangs out with the Musical Moron Twins, and he gets to go to bed with a recording artist who looks like Susan Dey-slash-Meg Ryan.  What's going on?  Listen up, because I think I can explain, with all modesty aside: I ask questions.  That's it.  That's my secret.  It works precisely because that isn't how you're supposed to do it, if you listen to the collective male wisdom.  There are still enough old-style, big-mouthed, egomaniacs running around to make someone like me appear to be refreshingly different.  If you can't hack this simple strategy, there are some women out there, of course, who want to get pushed around, ignored and mowed over, but do you really want to be with them anyway?",

More sure of himself? (pause) Less hard work, because I felt like I was dragging you around, sort of. (pause) A little sunnier.  Sparkier. (pause) I don't know.

I've done it all, lived through it all in my head.  I know the whole plot, the ending, and the good parts.  Now I'd have to watch it all over again in real time, and where's the fun in that?  And fucking--when is it all going to stop?  Am I going to jump from rock to rock for the rest of my life until there aren't any rocks left?  Am I going to bolt every time I get itchy feet?  Because I get them about once a quarter, along with the store's tax bill.  I've been thinking with my guts since I was fourteen years old and, frankly speaking, I've come to the conclusion that my guts have shit for brains.  You know what's wrong with Laura, what my problem is?  What's wrong with Laura is that I'll never see her for the first or second or third time.  That's all. Fuck it.  I'll probably mail the tape.
