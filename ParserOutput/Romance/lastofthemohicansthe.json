Their sound seems to reverberate as if in a cavern. A piece of sunlight refracts within the drops of water, paints a patch of moss yellow. The whisper of wind is joined by another sound that mixes with it. A distant rustling. It gets closer and louder. It's shallow breathing. It gets ominous. We're interlopers on the floor of the forest and something is coming. SUDDENLY: A MOCCASINED FOOT rockets through the frame scaring us and ... EXTREMELY CLOSE: PART OF AN INDIAN FACE running hard. His head shaved bald except for a scalp-lock. Tattoos. He's twenty-five. He seems tall and muscled. Heavy, even breathing. We'll learn later this man is UNCAS, the last of the Mohicans. PROFILE: UNCAS' ARMS flash as he runs. One carries a flintlock musket. Sweat on the man's skin. A calico shirt is gathered at the waist with a wampum belt of small white beads over a breechcloth. He wears leggings to protect his legs. A long-handled tomahawk is stuffed in his belt. CUT TO ... ANOTHER PART OF THE FOREST - MASSIVE WAR CLUB - DAY in the hand of another running man. He's heavier, older ... CHEST A green bear claw is tattooed there. Silver armband. A snake is tattooed over his left eyebrow. Silver rings in his ear. He's forty to forty-five. His head is shaved into a scalp-lock. It says: \"Come and lift this from me. Take it, if you can ...\" That prospect strikes us as extremely unlikely. This man is CHINGACHGOOK. The French call him \"Le Gros Serpent,\" the Great Snake, because \"he knows the winding ways of men's nature and he can strike a sudden, deathly blow.\" WIDE ANGLE: CHINGACHGOOK runs, disturbing no leaves, no branches; making no sound. He's running parallel to Uncas through the cathedral of mature forest. It's heavily canopied. There's very little brush. The girth of the trees is huge. Shafts of light illuminate motes of dust and turn leaves emerald where the sun breaks through. Sometimes there's ferns; rhododendron, sometimes pale grass and outcroppings of rock. These men run the forest streams, over boulders, fallen trees and down into ravines as if they own them. They do. CUT TO ... ANOTHER PART OF THE FOREST - LONG BLACK HAIR - DAY rocketing through trees. His torn buckskin shirt is tied at the waist with a wampum belt holding a tomahawk and a large knife. A long rifle in which is carved the name \"Killdeer\" is in his right fist. Indian tattooing on his chest. His name is NATHANIEL POE. He's a few years older than Uncas. The French and         the French-speaking tribes know him as La Longue Carabine (Long Rifle). Other frontiersmen in New York colony and the Iroquois and Delaware-speaking tribes know him as Hawkeye. Sweat stains his shirt. He flashes through the tree branches disturbing nothing. Making no sound. HAWKEYE'S POV: A PIECE OF TAN two hundred and fifty yards away, a few square inches buried in the foliage ... SUDDENLY HE STOPS Killdeer's at his shoulder ... HAWKEYE'S THUMB cocks the lock holding the piece of flint: click. UNCAS stops dead, holding out his hand ... no sound. CHINGACHGOOK slips through young trees and stops, shouldering his smoothbore musket. Is this an ambush? HAWKEYE'S POV: RACK FOCUS THROUGH THE GUN SIGHT Five feet and fourteen pounds of rifle is elevated a half inch and shifted left, off target. It's a precise, smooth movement. No human quiver. KILLDEER'S TRIGGER tighter ... THE COCK holding the flint hits the iron file of the frizzen, shooting sparks into the pan of priming powder which flashes and ... TAN is a huge elk that leaps at the sound. KILLDEER'S MUZZLE CRACKS like lightning. AN ELK leaps where the .59 caliber round was programmed to intercept him. On the moment of impact ... WIDE three men approach the fallen elk and each other. We realize they're hunting together. Hawkeye steps aside for Chingachgook. His massive war club is flat and angles to one side with a stabbing blade. Hawkeye is stepson and stepbrother. The two younger men treat Chingachgook with an easy deference and affection. Hawkeye's a dialectic of two cultures. In his coloration and worldliness he's more the Anglo-Saxon frontiersman. In his independent views and candid manner and in his combat skills and woodsmanship, he's more native American (Mohican). As Chingachgook takes out his long knife and they approach the fallen elk ...] CHINGACHGOOK (low Mohican; sub-titled) We're sorry to kill you, Brother. Forgive us. I do honor to your courage and speed, your strength ... CUT TO ...",

The Maxfield Parrish/Hudson Valley of tall trees, ravines and streams is idyllic in front of them. All three cradle their long guns and move silently on moccasined feet. FRONTAL: CHINGACHGOOK - in a stream - relaxed but attentive, abruptly stops. The others freeze in their tracks. Chingachgook sees and then stoops to examine ... ROCK under the water in the stream. It's been turned from its bed. Chingachgook finds another. Uncas, moving up on his flank, climbs the bank and moves off into the trees, searches and then he gestures ... he's found another sign of something. CHINGACHGOOK has headed off further down the stream and discovers nothing. Rapidly he rejoins Uncas and Hawkeye who've become extremely alert. They move up the bank into the forest ninety degrees from their previous path. TRACKING: HAWKEYE, UNCAS & CHINGACHGOOK moving. Fast. Nearly soundless. They hardly disturb a blade of grass.

There is a solidity to his dark, tall figure we didn't see before. Magua turns about face and advances on the column. TRACK WITH Magua. Heyward and the Munro girls pass the camera as does Sgt.

When Magua is two steps away he caves in the side of the infantryman's head at the temple with the spike end of his tomahawk and, backhanded, hacks the blade through the side of the neck of the center man in the first row. SIMULTANEOUSLY thirteen muskets EXPLODE from the wooded rise. FIVE REDCOATS are blown off the path, two others are wounded ... AMBROSE AMBROSE Form company! Left face! March! ALICE shrieks. Cora grabs Alice's reins and her own. HEYWARD pulling his fusil (short musket), seeing, firing, reaching for the women ... CORA'S HORSE bucking. ALICE'S HORSE bolting, dodging sideways, spilling Alice to the earth. AMBROSE AMBROSE Company make ready! The regulars slam into a firing line, stepping over the bodies of their comrades. All thirteen face the incline. FORESTED RISE - HURONS flash downhill through the trees. Partnered in two-man teams, one loads and prepares and fires while the other advances to the next cover. He, then, prepares and fires covering his partner's advance. Leaping fallen trees and boulders, they're athletic, fast and rapidly closing. Even though the disciplined English regulars are a killing machine, we now see their tactics in the dense forest are grossly inferior to the Hurons' ... AMBROSE Present!! CORA covers Alice with her body, holding the reins of their bolting horses. HEYWARD from horseback aims his horse pistol, FIRES ... AN ATTACKING HURON leaping at him past Alice & Cora drops. MULE with baggage crashes off, down the ravine. Another two Redcoats drop. Nine left. Then eight. AMBROSE AMBROSE Fire!! A musket volley as eight muskets go off as one shot, sending a lead scythe through leaves. But ... REVERSE: Hurons were behind cover. Only one was exposed and hit. AMBROSE (continuing) Load! Prime! The English rush to complete the reload. Will they do it in time? AMBROSE (continuing) Present! Present! Suddenly, Hurons - en masse - CRASH down onto the Redcoats line with tomahawks, war clubs and point-blank musket fire. ALICE on the ground, screaming insanely, covered by Cora who's protecting her little sister, and ... HEYWARD'S horse shot from beneath him, the animal folding, falling straight to the earth, and ... MAGUA shoots Ambrose in the chest, and ... HEYWARD by the Munro daughters spins, swinging his fusil like a ball-bat, upending one Huron and lunges with his bayonet in his left towards another. But this Huron easily slips the thrust and slams Heyward with his rifle butt. BRITISH dead and dying. AMBROSE blood gushing from his chest wound, fires his pistol, dropping a Huron; slashes a second with his sword. Then he's chopped down. Hurons begin scalping the British while four race towards Heyward and the two women. HEYWARD & CORA & ALICE ready to die. Heyward has only his fusil as a bludgeon. He readies ... THREE LOUD SHOTS",

A ruff of red hair stands straight up at the back of the large man's head. Slit and monstrously elongated earlobes are weighted with silver. He's followed by others. Wary, silently, they hunt. DEEPER: MORE OTTAWA Towards the rear are two French Rangers (\"Coureurs des Bois\") from Le Regiment de la Sarre. They're bearded, dirty, dressed Indian-style in moccasins, leggings and breechcloths with hooded hunting shirts. There's nothing clumsy about them. They're the 18th century version of Special Forces who've gone indigenous. If they and the Ottawa find our people, it's all over. ALICE seeing the red-painted Ottawa approach, starts to panic. Her hyperventilating and involuntary small sounds of fear will reveal their position. A hand covers her mouth and silences her struggling. WIDEN. It's Uncas. His other arm is around her, holding her, looking towards the advancing Ottawa. HAWKEYE on his back, his tomahawk within reach on the ground. OTTAWA & FRENCH are fifty yards away from the crescent mound behind which lie our people. Mist envelops them ... CHINGACHGOOK His massive arms spread revealing his war club in his left fist; his fusil in his right hand. HAWKEYE waiting for the attack. Cora's eyes are anxious, but there's no terror there. Nathaniel's impressed with her cool. He hands her a pistol. She takes it. He listens for the soft drop of moccasined feet ... OTTAWA through the grass. Thirty feet away they stop. They're motionless. Then their leader gestures and they start backing out. The French Rangers continue towards the crescent. The Ottawa chief takes one's arm and stops him. The French Ranger whispers something inaudible. The Ottawa chief shakes his head, \"Non. Pas possible ...\" And means it. They retreat. SEPERATE SHOTS: HAWKEYE, UNCAS, CHINGACHGOOK, CORA tensely monitor the Ottawa retreat. UNCAS & ALICE He slowly removes his hand from her mouth. She's a little shy, then she looks up, catches his eyes. Then she averts her face. CHINGACHGOOK sees all of it; doesn't like it. HAWKEYE The Ottawa are gone.",

The English fight stubbornly, but we feel they're outgunned. Meanwhile ... WIDE ANGLE FROM THE WATER A new artillery duel erupts. The action is to the west side of the fort. On the north, the fire fight is reflected on the black water of Lake George in our foreground. Then a dark shape wiping to the right cuts off those reflections. We see in silhouette the outline of a birch canoe moving silently, barely rippling the mirrored surface of the lake. EXTERIOR LAKE GEORGE BANK - DEBRIS Behind it, two Canadiens and a Huron alternately snipe at the ramparts. LOW & WIDE: SNIPERS Behind them is black water. Its surface is broken by the rising mass of Chingachgook, followed by Uncas and Hawkeye. Muzzle flashes from the cannon reveal the canoe and the forms of the girls further out. Chingachgook's war club is held low. The Huron senses and turns and Hawkeye's thrown tomahawk knocks him back. Hawkeye's knife flashes in the night. Chingachgook drives the war club up, smashing a Canadien onto the debris. The second Canadien jabs bayonet at Uncas, slashing his side.

REVERSE: FRENCH SOLDIERS Marquis de Montcalm, immaculate, backed by his guard of honor in white, grey and medium blue with six foot by eight foot regimental colors and the French flag (gold fleur-de-lis on a field of blue). FACES They carried two hundred and forty-five bateaux across a ten mile portage, all their supplies and artillery, and then rowed down the length of Lake George to get here. To         them, assaulting this fort is the easy part. The drummers of the honor guard play a tattoo behind them. INDIAN FACES Huron, Ottawa, Osage, Choctaw, Fox ... hear the drum of the honor guard and wait. They're in war paint. Many tattoos. Split ears. The Osage scalping locks are hennaed red. Canadiens among them are bearded, dirty, half savage ... At their head ... MAGUA in full war paint, with a coterie of Huron warriors, silent, waiting. Drums. INTERIOR FORT - ENGLISH TROOPS (TABLEAUX) grim, silent, watchful. COLONIAL MILITIA & MOHAWK INDIANS IN WAR PAINT (TABLEAUX) watching the parlay from a blown apart battery. Silent. WIDE: FRENCH & ENGLISH and their honor guards. Montcalm steps forward and sweeps his plumed hat to the ground in a courtly bow. Munro bows coldly. MONTCALM Colonel Munro, I have known you as a gallant antagonist. I am happy to make your acquaintance as a friend. MUNRO And I to make yours, Monsieur le Marquis. MONTCALM Please accept my compliments for the strong and skillful defense of your fortress. Under the command of a lesser man it would have fallen long ago given the superior numbers and material ... mere chance has allowed me to array against you ... MUNRO Monsieur le Marquis, I am a soldier, not a diplomat. You called this parlay for a reason. MONTCALM You have already done everything which is necessary for the honor of your Prince. I will forever bear testimony that your resistance has been gallant and was continued as long as there was hope. But now, I beg you to listen to the admonitions of humanity. I beg you to consider my terms for your surrender. MUNRO However I may apprise such testimony from Monsieur Montcalm, Fort William Henry is strong and stands. MONTCALM Honor that is freely accorded to courage, may be refused obstinacy ... These hills afford to us every opportunity to reconnoiter your works and I am possibly as well acquainted with your weak condition as you are yourselves. Is Webb really en route and Montcalm hopes to take the fort by duplicity before British reinforcements arrive? MUNRO Perhaps the General's glasses can reach to the Hudson and he knows the size and imminence of the army of Webb ...? Montcalm takes a moment to reply and appears genuinely sympathetic to Munro. MONTCALM (quietly) My scouts intercepted this dispatch intended for you. Munro is puzzled, suspicious. MONTCALM (to Bougainville) Read the dispatch. HEYWARD & MUNRO]",

MUNRO (to Montcalm) You have heard your answer, Monsieur le Marquis. (salutes) Munro starts off. Montcalm stops him. MONTCALM Sir. (challengingly) I am incapable of mistreating brave men. I beg you not to sign the death warrant of so many until you have listened to my terms. Munro turns. MUNRO Such as ...? MONTCALM My master requires the fort be destroyed. But, for you and your comrades, there is no privilege that will be denied. None of your men will see the inside of a prison barge. They're free to go so long as they return to England and fight no more on this continent, and the civilian militia return to their farms. MUNRO Their arms? MONTCALM They may leave the fortress fully armed, but with no ammunition ... Other than that, ask what you wish. Munro's impressed with Montcalm's generosity. MUNRO The honors of war? MONTCALM Granted. MUNRO My colors? MONTCALM Carry them to England to your King with pride. MUNRO Allow me to consult with my officers. As he turns away something's been disconnected inside Munro that can never get put back together. As the men move away from the French ... MUNRO I have lived to see two things I never expected. An Englishman afraid to support a friend. And a Frenchman too honest to profit by that advantage. HEYWARD General Webb can burn in hell. We'll go back and dig our graves behind the ramparts! Our mission is to fight. MUNRO (flares) Death and honor are sometimes thought to be the same. Today I have learned that they are not. Munro looks at the fortress behind him. HEYWARD Sir! MUNRO (stops him with his eyes) The decision is final. A beat. Then Munro turns toward Montcalm. Their eyes meet across the churned, scarred earth of the battlefield. MUNRO I am deeply touched by such unusual and unexpected generosity ... The fort is yours under the condition that we be given until dawn to bury our dead, prepare our men and women for their march and turn our wounded over to your surgeon. MONTCALM Granted, Monsieur. And Montcalm bows deeply and as he does so ... CUT TO ...",

Having let them go, I fear I will only fight the same men again when I move south. (pause; shrugs) And yet, I cannot break the terms of the capitulation and sully the lilies of France ... Long pause, wheels turn. Then: MAGUA Many things my French father cannot do, Magua can. Montcalm reacts as if he hadn't thought of that.

FRONT OF COLUMN - CORA WITH ALICE on the back of a mare. Alice, living through a wide-awake nightmare, is huddled under the arm of her sister. They ride behind the standard bearers. In the B.G. her father is seen approaching and takes his position at their side. Cora looks down the column, sheilding her eyes against the sun. We know who she's looking for ... Hawkeye. CORA'S POV: THE COLUMN The 62nd and 42nd Highlanders including Heyward ... thirty to forty women and a number of children - for safety - in the middle, some frontiersmen, Ongewasgone and many Mohawk, walking wounded. The column is still snaking its way out of the fort. No Hawkeye. CORA straining to see. EXTERIOR FORT - PRISONERS being assembled, their hands shackled. Hawkeye is among twelve or thirteen. He stands erect, walking out of the gate. The French are starting to pour in to loot the interior. Hawkeye looks to his left about twenty paces in front of him and sees ... UNCAS & CHINGACHGOOK on the other side of the column. Chingachgook cradles Killdeer as well as his own musket. They fall back to walk beside the prisoners on the other side of Hawkeye. Their eyes connect... We don't expect Hawkeye to stay shackled for the duration. RANK AND FILE FRENCH A few insults. The British soldiers answer. Nobody breaks rank. It's just talk. EXTERIOR ROAD - HAWKEYE His eyes sweep the column snaking its way into the v-shaped valley. The path cuts through the forested hills ahead. He sees ... HAWKEYE'S DISTANT POV: CORA riding near the front where there are no more French soldiers. Only a few scattered and curious Huron and Ottawa. She does not see him. PROFILE OF COLUMN - HIGH & WIDE as it passes left to right below like a long snake through the narrow valley. We're shooting from inside the dark woods. Lower, in the light, we see a scattering on both slopes of a couple of hundred Ottawa and Huron. They are in no order, are spread out and don't constitute a threat. They watch the column. SLOWLY THE CAMERA ... slides across the shoulders and back of a large man wearing black plumes in his scalp-lock and other than a breechcloth is almost naked. He is heavily war-painted ... FRONTAL - MAGUA and the left two-thirds of his face is painted red. The right third is painted black. Much silver is in his ears. His tomahawk is in his left hand. His cut-down musket in his right fist. Magua's attention is all focused to one point. MAGUA'S LONG & TIGHT POV: MUNRO & CORA & ALICE at the head of the column. This is the focus of Magua's attention. WIDE FRONTAL: COLUMN, STANDARD BEARERS & MUNROS Cora turns again to look for Hawkeye. CLOSER: CORA doesn't see him, but something else has caught her eye. YOUNG HURON running toward the column. Just one man. No musket. He's running and whooping like a dog charging from his master's front yard. Why? CLOSER the Huron arrives at the column, his tomahawk swings into his hand and he brains a British trooper who falls dead. The single Huron never breaks stride. He simply runs off again ... CORA horrified, holds Alice tighter. MUNRO has seen it too. And now he sees ... 62ND REGIMENT OF FOOT fixing bayonets. A large sergeant unsheathes a two-handed claymore, facing the Hurons and other Indians ... TROOPERS of the 33rd present arms. Did they violate the surrender by carrying ammunition? Locks are cocked. There's the answer. MUNRO Steady! No one fires! EXTERIOR FORESTED HILLSIDES - OTHER TRIBES are watching what happens. HEYWARD scanning them. HEYWARD (to Sergeant Major) Men are to stay in file, Sergeant Major! SERGEANT MAJOR Yes sir! Drums beat the cadence.",

As soon as they're through it, Uncas slams the paddle in the water and makes the canoe revolve a hundred and eighty degrees in a vortex so that now it's going through stern-first or the stern becomes the bow, so that Uncas could pilot it a different way through a hazard of ... EXPOSED ROCKS jutting out of the water. WIDE - BOTH CANOES Hawkeye didn't have to turn because Chingachgook, at the bow, uses his paddle to shove the canoe away from jutting rocks. Uncas does the same. Past the jutting rocks, Uncas swings it back around while ... WHITE WATER smashes into the camera. ALICE & CORA as the canoe roller-coasters and water bursts the bow.

The blues are turning purple and the greens are turning black and the white highlights of the foaming water are going rose. Reflecting the darkening sky, where the surface isn't broken, the water is fast-moving metal ... SUDDENLY: a shaved head and muscled back stands into the foreground. It moves down the shore away from camera. He's followed by other Huron warriors. They're two hundred yards away from Glen Falls island. HURON looks at the island of rock & trees and tilts his head curiously ... CUT TO ... EXTERIOR FOREST ABOVE CANYON & FALLS - GREY WOLF - TWILIGHT watches the Hurons below make their way towards the edge of the falls. OVER HIS SHOULDER: THREE MORE WOLVES join him, moving frenetically, uneasily ... The leader of the pack looks up & howls as his eyes go white reflecting the new moon. INTERIOR GLEN FALLS CAVE - HAWKEYE -NIGHT hears the distant howl. He's now lit silver blue by the moonlight through the falling water. Hawkeye knows it means Hurons are out there. He exchanges worried glances with Uncas & Chingachgook. UNCAS immediately starts up the right acclivity to one fissure, and Chingachgook moves carefully to the first fissure. Hawkeye follows. HAWKEYE His countenance gives way momentarily. All his experience seems of no avail. He touches the side of Cora's face. Grabs Killdeer and follows Chingachgook. ALICE sensing new danger, slips away on her own. CORA crosses to the Ranger who's semi-conscious, feverish and getting delirious. She can't do a thing except hold his hand and think of her father. CUT TO ... INTERIOR SOUTH FISSURE - HAWKEYE & CHINGACHGOOK below the edge, listen & wait, testing the environment with all their senses ... NORTH FISSURE - UNCAS against one wall, has his ear cocked, monitoring, facing away from the sky ... ALICE looks at the sky through the fissure. She sees the starfields and feels silver moonlight pull her forward. She starts out onto the island, oblivious, unaware she'll expose them. Suddenly ... UNCAS yanks her down next to him. He pulls her head into his chest, looking out over the edge, his tomahawk in front of him, his musket near his right hand. There is no sign she was seen. UNCAS & ALICE He relaxes, looks at her and puts his finger to his lips telling her to be silent. Languorously, she lies back, closes her eyes and lays a hand on his shoulder, palm up, as if he were a prince in a romantic fantasy. Uncas tries to restrain her. ALICE'S eyes slowly open. Oblivion disappears. It's replaced with escalating fear. She holds onto Uncas with desperation. Her fingers claw his shoulders. She buries her face in his chest. ALICE Uncas ... Her body shudders. Her terror's total. He tries to restrain and calm her. She won't let him. Then her mouth seeks his and in the passion of despair and fear and wanting life, she holds him between her thighs. And Uncas is confused, but Alice whispers his name and he responds. He loves her in the half-light. UNCAS his hand buried in her hair irradiated by the moon, then she seems to reach some emotional climax and begins to cry softly, and Uncas stops making love to her and holds her. Then she's flooded with shame. He reaches for her. She jerks away. He reaches for her again and clutches her to him. And she breaks down. Then he turns her face to him, but her expression has completely flattened. WIDER ANGLE She's not a lover to Uncas now. She's pitiful & stricken and he comforts her. CUT TO ...
