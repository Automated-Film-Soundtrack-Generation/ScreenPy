It's a quiet night and getting quieter, as several PATRONS are just leaving, waving goodbye to the bartender, JERRY, early 40s. Jerry turns to Pete, eyes him suspiciously from the end of the bar.  Pete picks up the bottle and pours another shot. Good boy, he got most of it in the glass.",

Moth-eaten velvet-flocked wallpaper hangs in shards and pieces from the walls.  It's sort of a cross between a gaudy cathouse and a mausoleum, served up with generous helpings of dust and grime, an almost unbeatable combination of questionable taste and neglect. Above the center of the lobby hangs what was -- and is -- probably the only truly beautiful item in the whole theater -- A DELICATE CRYSTAL CHANDELIER. Even under a veneer of dust, the fragile droplets of cut crystal seem to pick up every available point of light and scatter it in a hundred directions.

It's neat as a pin, and fairly lit, as Harry has just pulled back the curtains, allowing the sun to flood the room. A beam of golden light falls across a table, atop which are SEVERAL FRAMED PHOTOS. One of the photos is of the real, much-younger Luke.  It's a Norman Rockwell scene, at a train depot, with an army-issue olive drab duffel bag slung over his shoulder.  He has one arm around Harry and the other around his mother. (And by the way, Pete's resemblance to the real Luke -- even in a nearly 10 year old photo -- is pretty damn startling...)",

He turns to go back to his chair, but the second he does so, the reception goes haywire.  He returns to the spot in front of the TV, and the picture is perfect again. The DOORBELL RINGS.

BIJOU LOBBY - NIGHT Luke's about to close the door, when he looks down and sees CAT MEOWING at him from the sidewalk.  He holds the door open, and Cat shoots into the lobby, disappearing into the auditorium.  Luke closes the door... and stops.  He HEARS something, and so do we.  Soft and faraway, it's a PIANO. The melody is soft, lilting -- almost a lullaby. Luke turns toward the music, which is coming from the auditorium.  The piano continues, building slightly in volume.  He moves to the auditorium doors and tentatively pushes one open. INT.  AUDITORIUM - NIGHT Luke enters, his face bathed in the soft, flickering, reflected light of THE SCREEN. The movie is \"The Big Parade.\"  The old, decomposing nitrate print is badly scratched and stained.  A young, beautiful Renee Adoree is bidding a tearful farewell to her lover, John Gilbert, as he marches off to fight the Great War. Luke stares at the screen.  The look on his face is one of bewilderment -- and awe. ANGLE - THE PIANO The rickety old upright is tinny-sounding and slightly out- of-tune.  But it really doesn't matter. CLOSER Mrs. Terwilliger is playing passionately.  She never takes her eyes -- which are full of tears -- off the tattered screen, except to close them when she is overcome with emotion.  Even so, she never misses a beat. HER HANDS fairly dance upon the keys.  Stiff and wrinkled as they are, they manage to elicit every possible fragment of sensitivity that the old piano can muster. Luke is moved by what he's witnessing.  This is the magic... WIDER ANGLE - THE CENTER SECTION To the right of Luke, sitting in the center of a row, is Old Tim.  Stroking Cat, Old Tim stares at the poignant scene unfolding on the screen, pausing only to wipe his eyes and nose with a handkerchief.  He doesn't notice LUKE who looks up towards the projection booth.",

PUSHING INTO THE LIGHT, we get closer to the windows of the booth.  We come out of the beam and can just barely make out the figure of Harry, framed in a small window next to the projector. WE CONTINUE PUSHING IN -- closer and closer -- until Harry's face fills the screen.  He is watching the film; his eyes are wide and moist, as though he's experiencing the magic that's unfolding on the screen for the very first time. The warning bell on the projector CHIMES THREE TIMES, signaling the end of the reel.  Harry moves away from the window. INT.  PROJECTION BOOTH - NIGHT Never taking his eyes off the screen, Harry watches as the film comes to an end and flap!  falp!  falps!  out of the projector.  He kills the motor and cranks the carbon arcs apart, and the bright beam dies.  It's not the end of the movie, but it is the end of the only fragment they have. Harry moves to the house lights rheostat, and slowly fades them up.  This done, he pulls a handkerchief from his back pocket and blows his nose loudly. He crosses back to the projector, unlatches the full take-up reel and takes it down.  He's about to move away, when he senses that he's not alone.  He looks over the projector to see LUKE, standing there.  Their eyes meet.  Someone should say something -- both men search for words.  Suddenly, Luke feels very out-of-place, almost embarrassed -- as though he's interrupted a very private ritual. Harry senses this.  Clutching the precious reel of film tightly to his chest, he searches Luke's face and smiles warmly.",

ANGLE - THE SCREEN Harry's on a ladder, snipping the cords holding up the old screen, which is dropping, bit-by-bit, into the arms of Luke and Adele, who are surrounded by a group of LITTLE KIDS, watching the goings-on in wide-eyed awe. Harry snips the last line, and the rest of the old screen drops down on Luke's head.  Suddenly... LUKE'S A GHOST!!  He raises his arms and plays the bogeyman for the kids, who scream in mock terror and scatter, as Harry and Adele laugh. INT.  AUDITORIUM - DAY Old Tim and Harry carry a dilapidated row of seats up the aisle, as Adele and Mabel move in, tearing up the rotten carpeting and sweeping up the dust and debris. The men are having a tough time carrying the seats, and just as they're about to drop the row, someone rushes in next to Harry and grabs his end.  It's Carl Leffert.  A second later, someone else grabs Old Tim's end. BOB LEFFERT has a good purchase on the seats with his good hand and his hook.  He nods to Old Tim, who steps away, mopping his brow. Luke smiles as he sees this from the front of the auditorium. INT.  BIJOU LOBBY - DAY Harry, Stanton and Mrs. Terwilliger, with the help of Avery Wyatt and his son Spencer, tear down the rotting draperies and scrape off the wallpaper covering the lobby walls.  Then, as Harry, Spencer and Stanton sand down the walls, Avery and Mrs. Terwilliger hand them freshly-mixed cans of red wall paint and brushes.  Immediately, they all set to work painting. EXT.  THE BIJOU SIGN - DAY Luke is on the roof of the theater, pliers in hand and tool box nearby.  He's just straightened out the \"J\" and he steps back... carefully... to admire his handiwork.  For the first time in a long time, the sign actually reads, \"THE BIJOU.\" But not for long.  Luke tenses... the building starts shaking... and the train passes by behind the theater.  Luke lunges out of the way as three letters shake lose and fall. Once again, the sign reads, \" HE B J U.\"  Luke winces. EXT.  CITY HALL SQUARE - DAY Ernie Cole and Avery Wyatt stand solemnly at the front of a small group gazing at the base of the war memorial, as it takes shape in a prominent place in the square... INT.  AUDITORIUM - DAY Harry is on a ladder, attaching the final spring stretcher to a corner of the muslin.  It snaps into place, and voila -- new screen!  Luke, Adele, Doc Lardner, and Sheriff Eldridge, standing below, applaud enthusiastically. INT.  ORCHESTRA PIT - DAY As work progresses all around her, Mrs. Terwilliger has just finished dusting off the piano.  She opens the keyboard cover and trails her hand delicately over the keys.  She sits, closes her eyes, and begins to play -- Chopin's Op. 10 Etude No. 3 -- delicate, flowing music.  Even though the piano is a bit out of tune, it's still beautiful. As she plays, all the work slowly comes to a halt.  Before long, all eyes are on her.  Everyone's listening. Transported. After a moment, she stops.  Overcome.  Everyone applauds. Surprised, Mrs. Terwilliger stands, and, blushing, bows.",

ON THE CROWD One-by-one, the gold stars of the town's boys are solemnly held aloft by their loved ones. Luke and Harry stand at the side of the square, looking out at the sea of four or five dozen gold stars being held aloft. Luke catches a glimpse of a man in an army uniform... LUKE'S POV It's Bob Leffert, standing with Mabel, looking very sharp in his dress greens.  He brings his hook-hand up and salutes smartly.  Mabel takes his good hand, squeezes it as she blinks back tears.

The bell on the running projector DINGS! once, signalling that the reel is coming to an end.  Harry looks out the window at the screen, then back to the task at hand. INT.  BIJOU LOBBY - NIGHT Luke comes out of the office carrying a folded movie poster. With a satisfied smile, he walks through the lobby, admiring how handsome the old place looks.  Old Tim, snappily attired in his uniform, is sweeping a tiny pile of debris into a dustpan.  Mrs. Terwilliger is straightening up the candy counter.  All is well. Luke goes to the lobby's poster case.  He opens it, and unfolds a brand-new one-sheet poster for \"SAND PIRATES\" -- the same design as the one-sheet we saw in Pete's apartment. Methodically, he thumbtacks the poster up and closes the case. As Luke passes the auditorium doors, a MAN comes out of the theater and crosses to the candy counter.  The door stays open for a moment, and Luke decides to duck inside and catch a bit of the picture. INT.  AUDITORIUM - NIGHT ON THE SCREEN - \"SAND PIRATES OF THE SAHARA\" The second-to-last reel of a black-and-white early-50's programmer.  It's nighttime in the desert.  A huge full moon hangs over a B-movie soundstage version of the pyramids. GREGORY, a dark, handsome leading man in a pith helmet is engaged in a fierce swordfight with KHALID, the villain. Pete takes a seat on the aisle near the door.",

Carl Leffert.  Bob Leffert and Mabel Lanier.  Daley Thornhill.  Katie Rutherford.  Stanton Lawson.  Now, there's nothing in the least bit threatening about the gathering -- and that's what's so disturbing about it.  They're not an angry mob, they're just standing there, running the gamut of emotions. Shock.  Disillusionment.  Betrayal. It's an awkward moment.  Pete doesn't quite know how to react.  He wants to go over and talk to them, but he wouldn't know what to say.  He wishes one of them would talk to him, just say something, anything.  But no one does. Then, Bob Leffert turns away from Pete.  He shoves his hook hand into his pocket and sullenly moves away, followed by Mabel, then his brother, then the others... ... leaving Pete alone.",

Members of the AUDIENCE crane their necks to see out into the hallway, from where the witnesses will be entering. The COMMITTEE MEMBERS are seated at their dais, brightly lit by the dozens of newsreel and TV lights.  Elvin Clyde is seated at the far right.  Dead center of the dais is the Chairman, CONGRESSMAN T. JOHNSTON DOYLE of Wisconsin, a husky man in his late 50s.  He SLAMS his gavel down several times and the room goes quiet -- the talking stops, and the cameras start whirring. INT.  LARDNER LIVING ROOM - DAY Adele's in a chair, eyes glues to the TV set.  Mrs. Terwilliger and Old Tim sit on the couch, watching attentively. Doc Lardner's in a straight-backed chair at a jaunty angle to the set, holding the rabbit ears uncomfortably high aloft.",
