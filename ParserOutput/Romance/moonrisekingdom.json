In order to show you how a big symphony orchestra is put together, Benjamin Britten has written a big piece of music, which is made up of smaller pieces that show you all the separate parts of the orchestra. As Lionel listens, three other children wander out of their bedrooms and down to the landing. The first is an eight-year-old boy in a bathrobe. He is Murray. The second is a nine-year-old boy in white boxer shorts and a white undershirt. He is Rudy. The third is a twelve-year-old girl in a cardigan sweater with knee-high socks and brightly polished, patent-leather shoes. She is Suzy. She carries a one-month-old striped kitten. The boys drop down to the floor next to their brother. They lie on their stomachs with their chins propped up on their fists, listening. Suzy sits in the windowsill. She opens a book called Shelly and the Secret Universe. There is an illustration on the cover of a young gymnast with a glowing amulet around her neck. Suzy starts to read -- then pauses. She lowers her book. She raises a pair of junior binoculars to her eyes. She looks out into the rain.",

Suzy blows them a kiss. Everyone looks choked up. Cousin Ben unloops a line. The sails quickly catch the strong wind, and the boat sails away into the harbor.
