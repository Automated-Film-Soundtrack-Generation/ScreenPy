Each street sign seems to be magical to her and she says the names to herself as they pass by. She sees La Tijera, La Cienega, Venice Boulevard, Pico Boulevard, Olympic Boulevard, Wilshire Boulevard, etc., etc. until they reach Fountain and turn right. Betty's heart is pounding when she sees Havenhurst and the cab turns left. In the middle of the block on the right the cab pulls over and stops. Betty sees her new home ... an ancient, gorgeous courtyard apartment building, built during the golden age of cinema. CUT TO: EXT. 1612 HAVENHURST The cab driver puts Betty's bags down on the sidewalk next to her. She can barely stop looking at the building long enough to pay the cab driver who then goes off and drives away. Betty picks up her bags and enters, as if in a dream, through an ornate iron gate to a courtyard with a beautiful working fountain at its center. A sign on a door to her right reads Manager and she rings the bell. An older, once very beautiful, woman wearing heavy make-up and smoking a cigarette in a silver holder opens the door. An unbelievable raspy voice comes out through the dark screen of the still closed screen door.",

With a sense of \"just more stuff I got to do\" Joe moves slowly and begrudgingly out of Ed's office, checks the corridor and goes toward the screaming which still persists. He opens up the office door next to Ed's and finds a heavy set woman screaming bloody murder as she is grabbing her buttock and lower back. He sighs and walks over to her and cups his hand tightly around her mouth to squelch the screaming. Wide-eyed, she tries to fight him off and he begins dragging her out of her office. Joe's foot catches on a computer cable clumsily taped across the floor and he falls backwards bringing the heavy woman down with a bone-crushing blow on top of him. The woman begins beating his face with her meaty fists. Joe snaps her head back, instantly stilling her violent activity. He wrestles the stunned heavyweight back to her feet and out her door. He pushes and pulls her into Ed's office. Just before they enter, Joe notices a man with a vacuum cleaner watching him from the far end of the corridor. He stops and calls to the man.",

Joe goes in to Ed's office with the woman. He throws her down on the floor in line between Ed's desk and the bullet hole in the wall. She starts screaming immediately and struggles to get up.

His eyes begin to widen in reaction to the scene. Just then Joe fires a bullet into the man's chest. The man inadvertently flicks on the vacuum cleaner as his hands rush up to the wound. As the vacuum cleaner whines Joe rushes to the man before the man falls back out into the corridor. He pulls him into the room - the man moaning and clutching his chest, starting to collapse. Joe releases him and the man goes down. The vacuum cleaner seems to be screeching now in the threshold. Joe fires the last bullet into the heavy duty vacuum cleaner.

Through the half light they move deeper into the bungalow to a corridor. CUT TO: EXT. SIERRA BONITA APARTMENTS - BUNGALOW #12 - DAY The Middle-Aged Woman is just shutting the door to her bungalow. She walks quickly in the direction of Bungalow #17. CUT TO: INT. - BUNGALOW #17 - DAY Betty and Rita are moving down the corridor. They pass a small room and look in at a couch, wardrobe and make-up table. They move on down the corridor to a door which is almost closed. Betty touches the door and it seems to swing open on its own. They enter the room and stop cold. A scream starts to build inside Rita. Before them is a dead woman lying on a bed. Great chunks of mattress are standing upright having been ripped and torn by shotgun blasts. A dried sea of blood surrounds the bloated, gray body of the woman. The scream comes out of Rita as a force propelling her to look closer. Betty lunges after Rita, her eyes also not able to leave the sight. She covers Rita's mouth with her hand and brings her close. The scream is stifled by Betty's hand. In the silence that follows, knocking can be heard. Betty freezes and keeps Rita quiet with her hand still placed over her mouth, but she can't stop Rita's violent shaking nor the horror in her eyes. CUT TO: EXT. BUNGALOW #17 - DAY The Middle-Aged Woman backs away from the front door, looking around at bungalow #17. She's not sure if she has heard something or not. She wonders, then turns and goes back to her bungalow. Just as she has disappeared the door to Bungalow #17 flies open and Rita, followed closely behind by Betty, runs with a look of horror directly toward us until her tortured face fills the screen. Sounds, churning music. CUT TO: INT. AUNT RUTH'S APARTMENT - BATHROOM - DAY Sounds, music churning continues. Great sobs, almost hysterical, wrack Rita's body as she bends over the sink, scissoring into her long, dark hair with a frenzy. There is a loud sound of the scissors cutting deep through many strands of hair. Betty's is rushing to her - her hands reach tenderly, but firmly for Rita's hand holding the scissors. She keeps her from cutting and moves closer, whispering in Rita's ear. Rita can't stop crying, but lets Betty hold her. Music changes ...",
