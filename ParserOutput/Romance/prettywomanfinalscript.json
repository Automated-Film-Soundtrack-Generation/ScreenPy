Close Up on Vivian's face laughing and holding the glass of Champagne. She looks up at Edward, still seated on the sofa. Close shot on Edward looking at Vivian Close Up shot on Vivian's face. She has a strange smile on her face. Close Up shot on Edward's face looking at Vivian. Back to Vivian. We hear the recorded laughs coming from the TV set. Vivian stands up on her arms and knees and walks on all four toward the sofa. Quick shot on the TV screen, where Lucy and the other woman are stomping the grapes. High angle shot on Vivian on her knees near the sofa. She puts a hand up inside Edward's pants leg. Edward snorts. On the TV screen, Lucy now seems to be enjoying her grapes stomping. Still resting on her knees, Vivian is taking her white top off her shoulders. She slips it down, and because the top is attached to the skirt, the skirt comes down with it. Vivian is now wearing only her black lace underwear and bra. Vivian puts the top and the skirt away from her on the floor, and bends down on the seated Edward. Suddenly, she stands up and walks away. Edward seems surprised. But she comes back with a cushion that she drops on the floor, and then kneels on it. She takes the TV remote control from the table by the sofa, and presses a button on it. On the TV screen, Lucy and the Italian lady are still stomping the grapes, but the sound shuts off. Back to the sofa. Closer shot. Vivian puts the remote control back on the table. Then she leans on Edward, and starts taking his necktie off. Edward puts his hand on her hair, and seems surprised : he hadn't realized it was a wig. Quick shot on the TV screen, where Lucy and her Italian friend are now dancing on the grapes. Back to the sofa, where Vivian is taking Edward's pants off. She opens his shirt on his chest, and bends on it. Close Up on their two faces, very close to each other.",

Medium shot of Edward entering the lounge. The camera then follows Edward crossing the lounge toward the bar. Larger shot of the lounge, with the bar in the background. There are not many people at this early time of the evening. Medium shot of the bar. Only one person is seated on a stool at the bar. Even if we see only her back, we guess she is Vivian. But Edward doesn't seem to recognize her, because he keeps looking around for her. As Edward is looking the other way from the bar, Vivian turns around and looks at him. Edward walks a couple of steps toward the door, and then turns around and eventually notices Vivian. Medium shot on Edward. There is a look of surprise in Edward's eyes when he recognizes Vivian. Back to Vivian still seated at the bar. She doesn't look like the Vivian we were used to see. She is wearing a very elegant dark- colored cocktail dress. Her hair also has been very elegantly styled. Edward looks at her without moving for a few seconds. She stands up from the bar and walks toward him.",
