NARRATOR The advent of the Soviet nuclear capability ushers in a dangerous phase of the Cold War as the decade of the 1950s looms.  Stung by this Soviet challenge and the rapid race to develop ever more sophisticated weapons, the United States resurrects maverick Professor Toichi Hikita's work in electromagnetic particle acceleration...despite the dismal record of failure that has dogged the project. TOICHI HIKITA, one of the group, walks forward, taking the CAMERA from its present operator, a four-year-old child...A LITTLE BOY IN CHAPS AND COWBOY HAT who now joins the other adults, in particular Caucasian woman and the elder Oriental man who pick him up and hug him... NARRATOR Doctor Masado Banzai, preeminent Japanese quantum theorist, declares himself anxious to work for the Allies.  Enamored of the great American West, Banzai sires a precocious son and tags the tiny child \"Buckaroo.\" A tribute to his adopted homeland. EXT.  TEST SITE - DAY        2 A strange TWO-MAN SPEED VEHICLE readies for takeoff...the FIRST \"PILOT\" in the cockpit Dr. Banzai himself: NARRATOR And thus given a second chance after his secret pre-war laboratory disaster at Princeton, Doctor Hikita finds new life at the Texas School of Mines, where he assembles a team of crack scientists willing to gamble he's right in his bold assertion that man can indeed pass unharmed through solid matter.

Thought you'd wanna be notified. That old pal of the professor's, Dr. Emilio Lizardo?  The one you did the brain scan on--?  He killed a guard last night, broke outta the Trenton Home for the Criminally Insane, stole a Masarati, totaled it a block away. Buckaroo's expression changing at the mention of the name Lizardo...taking the print-out. BUCKAROO BANZAI Then what? RAWHIDE Vanished. Thin air. PERFECT TOMMY Doctor Lizardo. Wasn't he on TV once? RENO You're thinking of Mr. Wizard.  This guy's an eccentric genius. PERFECT TOMMY Hey, so was Mr. Wizard. RAWHIDE Dr. Lizardo's a raving lunatic, Perfect Tommy, a vicious psychopath with crazy eyes and flaming orange hair that once upon a time was mousy brown like yours. BUCKAROO BANZAI Have you warned Professor Hikita? RAWHIDE First thing I did. PERFECT TOMMY (in the dark) Why?  What's going on?  Anything I oughta know?  C'mon, Rawhide, spill it. Buckaroo nodding his permission... RAWHIDE The professor and Dr. Emilio Lizardo were actually the first to discover the Eighth Dimension.  Almost fifty years ago.  Before Buckaroo's parents even knew each other.  But there was trouble, a rocket catapult failed and Dr. Lizardo got sucked half in, half out...when they hauled him back ,he wasn't the same guy.  His hair was orange... BUCKAROO BANZAI And his soul black as the Ace of Spades. RAWHIDE He went on a senseless crime spree, killed a cop during a bank robbery, got caught and judged insane.  The professor told us they threw away the key. PERFECT TOMMY Hey, any lock can be picked.  So what's he up to? BUCKAROO BANZAI I'm sure we'll find out soon enough. Buckaroo heading for the door...Rawhide drawing a receipt book from his pocket. RAWHIDE And another thing.  Somebody took five bucks outta petty cash without signing. Buckaroo and Reno automatically turning to Perfect Tommy... PERFECT TOMMY Wasn't me.  I'd take a hundred, right? INT.  WORLD WATCH ONE/BUS - DAY        134 ...the guys following Buckaroo into an amazing ELECTRONIC NERVE CENTER, like the rugged interior of an AWACS, dimly lighted instrument panels manned by two BLUE SHIELD TECHNICAL EXPERTS. RADAR SHEILD ONE Lookit this, Buckaroo.  Grossly abnormal high-altitude electrostatic disturbance over Connecticut.  Fallout from the Jet Car, you think? BUCKAROO BANZAI Doubt it.  Check NORAD command.  Could be a volcanic ash cloud.  Work her up statistically, check it for the next twenty-four hours, then shovel the data over to Reno. INT.  PASSENGER SECTION/BUS - DAY        135 Buckaroo coming through another heavy steel door, and for the first time we realize that we just might be on a MOVING BUS... EXT.  POLICE STATION - ESTABLISHING - DAY        136 BUCKAROO'S BUS pulling up...BUCKAROO BANZAI AND THE HONG KONG CAVALIERS emblazoned along its side. INT.  POLICE STATION - DAY        137 Waiting near the watch desk, Buckaroo's Jewish surgeon buddy, Dr. Zwibel...in a thousand-dollars worth of drugstore cowboy gear, a Hoppalong Cassidy hat, red alligator boots, listening to the local COUNTRY STATION on a suitcase size stereo... ...looking up as Buckaroo, Reno, and Perfect Tommy approach... DR. ZWIBEL Howdy, Buckaroo.  Got your message about rendezvousing here.  Barely had time to pack my saddlebags. BUCKAROO BANZAI Sid, welcome aboard. (shaking hands) Fellas, meet a medical colleague, Sid Zwibel.  He'll be riding with us from now on, so get acquainted while I snoop around. Buckaroo heading over to the DESK SERGEANT on duty... RENO The name's Reno.  This here's Perfect Tommy. PERFECT TOMMY Where do you hail from, Doc? DR. ZWIBEL (catching on) New Jersey! RENO NEVADA Where's your spurs at? DR. ZWIBEL You making fun of me? PERFECT TOMMY Reno, how's about you take New Jersey's gear, mosey on over to the bus and introduce him to the rest of the hands. RENO Why me? PERFECT TOMMY Cause Buckaroo needs me here. Reno picking up Doctor Zwibel's huge stereo and suitcase... RENO Follow me, pard'ner. INT.  CELL - DAY        138 Penny sitting on her bunk, a disheveled mess...depressed, her head buried in her hands as Buckaroo arrives.  She sees his reflection in the pitiful mirror above her toilet... PENNY PRIDDY What're you doing here? Why're you looking at me like that? BUCKAROO BANZAI I guess 'cause you remind me of someone I once knew, long ago before any of this craziness. PENNY PRIDDY Go away.  Let me rot? BUCKAROO BANZAI Who were you really trying to kill last night? PENNY PRIDDY You.  Like the papers all say. BUCKAROO BANZAI Pretty terrible shot. Silence.  Penny realizing you don't fool this man with the sloppy bowtie...coming over to the bars... PENNY PRIDDY Was she pretty? BUCKAROO BANZAI Who? PENNY PRIDDY The girl I remind you of. BUCKAROO BANZAI She was the Queen of the Netherlands. PENNY PRIDDY It's kinda hard this way. Meaning fixing his tie...which she's trying to do... BUCKAROO BANZAI I'd turn around, but I'm afraid you'd strangle me. PENNY PRIDDY The Netherlands.  Whew, that's a long way from Wyoming. BUCKAROO BANZAI Wyoming? Not Cody, by any chance? PENNY PRIDDY No.  Laramie.  Except I was born in Cody. How did you know that?  Oh, right, sure, I forgot: you know everything. BUCKAROO BANZAI No, I don't. Penny taking too long to retie Buckaroo's tie...an excuse to be near him... BUCKAROO BANZAI Having a little trouble with that knot, aren't you? PENNY PRIDDY Which?  The one in my throat. Things really heating up between these two...Buckaroo changing the subject...blocking Perfect Tommy's view. BUCKAROO BANZAI Did you have family there--? A sister?  In Cody? PENNY PRIDDY I don't know. I always felt like I did, like there was another me... BUCKAROO BANZAI Another 'you'? PENNY PRIDDY Somewhere.  See I was taken away by the Priddies when I was a baby.  I was adopted. BUCKAROO BANZAI Adopted.  I should have know. Of course. If it was a snake, it'd bit me! PENNY PRIDDY What?  I don't understand you.  I don't understand anything anymore. BUCKAROO BANZAI Who does?  It's a crazy mixed-up world.  Just do the best you can with what you have... Buckaroo touching her moist cheek, wiping away a tear.  Perfect Tommy and the Desk Sergeant exchanging looks... PERFECT TOMMY Running a little late, Buckaroo. BUCKAROO BANZAI Let her out. In my custody. PERFECT TOMMY Let her out?  She's a killer. Buckaroo and Penny unable to look away from each other. BUCKAROO BANZAI No she's not. INT.  PRESS CONFERENCE - AFTERNOON        139 REPORTERS, cameras, microphones, and a small audience of VIPS, civilian and military, in a large hotel conference room...eyes on the ticking clock...examining charts and MODELS OF SUBATOMIC PARTICLES...on the dais, Professor Hikita, Secretary of Defense McKinley and Senator Cunningham, waiting for Buckaroo.",

Had my own think tank.  Got tired of thinking-wanted some action.  Seen plenty of it too.  So will you if you stick around. PENNY PRIDDY Where's Buckaroo?  Is he alive? RENO Course he's alive.  He's Buckaroo Banzai. Rawhide calling from across the room... RAWHIDE All right.  Let's go!  We got our work cut out for us tonight!

INSTITUTE CORRIDOR - NIGHT        279 Rawhide, hearing screams from the Professor's laboratory, races down the corridor, gun drawn... INT.  BUCKAROO'S BEDROOM - NIGHT        280 Buckaroo coming into his bedroom, opening a dresser drawer when suddenly...A NOISE BEHIND HIM!  Buckaroo whirling instinctively with twin EBONY HANDLED COLTS a fraction of a second from firing...at PENNY! ...the latter poking her head out of Buckaroo's closet just long enough to see him aim his silver pistols, jumping back into the closet, slamming the door...an exasperated Buckaroo stepping over to the closet, finding it locked...knocking... BUCKAROO BANZAI Open up or I'll shoot it off. PENNY PRIDDY I'll shoot yours off if I had a gun, you double-dealing Casanova!  I thought you liked me for myself.  But why should you, huh?  A jerk like me. Buckaroo understanding at last the reason for Penny's odd behavior, seeing THE PHOTOGRAPH on his bedstand of a younger, possibly not-yet- so-world-famous Buckaroo Banzai in tuxedo...his pretty companion A DEAD RINGER FOR PENNY. BUCKAROO BANZAI Penny, look- PENNY'S VOICE You look.  Who is she? BUCKAROO BANZAI That's kinda complicated to get into right now because the world's maybe coming to an end and I can't stand here and talk to a closet door. PENNY'S VOICE Yeah, whose world is coming to an end?  You only wanted me because I remind you of her. Buckaroo fidgeting, precious seconds ticking away... BUCKAROO BANZAI Penny, I was going to get into that, but I haven't had time...with arachtoids and all...but briefly she was your long lost twin sister, we got married, and that's about all I can say.  Right now. (no response) Penny? A silence from the other side, the closet door unlocking...slowly opening, revealing Penny standing in the middle of a pile of female clothing... PENNY PRIDDY Married--?  So that's it!  Buckaroo Banzai, a married man.  Where is she?  With the kids some place? Buckaroo turning...Penny eyeing him, penetrating his soul... PENNY PRIDDY She must've been a bigger fool than me if she ran out on a guy like you... BUCKAROO BANZAI She was killed, Penny. PENNY PRIDDY Oh, my. BUCKAROO BANZAI Don't go to pieces.  I haven't got time tonight. A pregnant pause, the pain evident on Buckaroo's face as he turns back to the job at hand, picking up his holster and rummaging through the dresser drawer, fighting back the painful memories... PENNY PRIDDY Looks like you're the one might go to pieces. BUCKAROO BANZAI Where's my damn ammo?  Nothing is ever where it's supposed to be around here! PENNY PRIDDY How did she die?  I wanna know. BUCKAROO BANZAI You don't wanna know. PENNY PRIDDY Yes, I do.  Gimme a chance.  I'm stronger than you think. BUCKAROO BANZAI She was murdered by Hanoi Shan on our wedding night. PENNY PRIDDY Hanoi Shan--?  The guy in your comic books.  Boss of the World Crime League?  Supreme Commander of the Legion of Death?  The Pivot of Mystery himself?  You're putting me on.  He's a cartoon character. BUCKAROO BANZAI I wish he was.  He's real enough. Penny having to sit down and think about this as Buckaroo straps on his guns...changes his torn and shredded jacket...Penny looking at a BUCKAROO BANZAI COMIC BOOK on the night stand...then at the framed photograph of Peggy... PENNY PRIDDY God, she's so young and beautiful.  I don't remember her at all.  Which I guess is good, under the circumstances.  I bet you'll never forget her though. One look at Buckaroo says it all... BUCKAROO BANZAI Never. PENNY PRIDDY I gotta be honest with myself and not repress these feelings-I've got mixed emotions-I don't know if I can handle this.  Oh, boy... BUCKAROO BANZAI I gotta go.  We're on borrowed time. PENNY PRIDDY Go where?  Where're you going? BUCKAROO BANZAI (squatting close to her) Please, Penny.  You just gotta trust me now.  Okay?  And don't panic. Because it's gonna be all right. PENNY PRIDDY What?  If we just believe in Buckaroo Banzai? BUCKAROO BANZAI Yeah...and maybe more important, if you believe in yourself. PENNY PRIDDY Believe in Penny Priddy? BUCKAROO BANZAI Absolutely. Penny looks into his eyes... PENNY PRIDDY You've got your six guns strapped on.  You're ridding off on another adventure?  Oh, my God, it's all real...it really is real.  I should go with you.  Please... BUCKAROO BANZAI It's too dangerous. PENNY PRIDDY That's just what you would say.  This is so unreal.  I'm dreaming... Starry-eyed, she leans forward to kiss him, Buckaroo about to oblige when their fingers touch, Penny getting a MILD ELECTRICAL SHOCK... ...the door suddenly opens and Perfect Tommy sticks his head in...",

(a pause) ...Miss Priddy claims to be unable to solve my problem. And provide the crucial missing circuit for my Overthruster.  Perhaps you can convince her to try. Lizardo holding the phone toward Penny, ripping her gag off... PENNY PRIDDY I'm not worth it, Buckaroo! Forget me! BUCKAROO BANZAI Penny--?!  Are you all right? Doctor Lizardo yanking the phone from Penny, remaining silent for a second to torture Buckaroo's soul... BUCKAROO BANZAI She knows nothing, Lizardo. DOCTOR LIZARDO Then shall we say \"A Penny for your thoughts?\" You can come in her place. Yoyodyne, Dr. Banzai. Come alone, with your Overthruster! (hanging up) He'll bring it.  I know his type. Penny glancing surreptitiously at her large transparent purse, THE OVERTHRUSTER IN A JUMBLE OF COSMETICS! DOCTOR LIZARDO Take her to the pit!  Use more honey.  Find out what she knows. Smiling smugly, Lizardo heads for the door, Penny squirming in her seat as the TINY ANTS dig in... PENNY PRIDDY Who are you?  Hanoi Shan?  The Scourge of Burma!  The Pivot of Mystery? Well, you're not destroying me like you did my sister! Lizardo simply sneering at her as he goes out the door... INT.  PASSENGER SECTION/BUS - NIGHT        321 A flurry of well-ordered activity taking place...Hong Kong Cavaliers and Blue Shield Irregulars along with Pinky Carruthers.  Casper and Scooter...sitting up front like paratroopers, cleaning their back-pack FLAMETHROWERS...SAWED-OFF SHOTGUNS...Buckaroo giving them a chalk talk, an aerial photograph of Yoyodyne on the clear plexiglas 'blackboard'... BUCKAROO BANZAI These antidote filters the Professor's whipped up will let you to see them like I have since yesterday, as arachtoidal creatures. They won't be pretty, nothing personal, John Parker.  But just remember...if we fail tonight, there's no tomorrow. JOHN PARKER They will never surrender.  They will fight to the end. Buckaroo nodding...THE CAVALIERS BREATING THEIR ANTIDOTE FILTERS, SEEING NOW \"THE ALIEN\" JOHN PARKER WITH A MIXTURE OF DISBELIEF AND HORROR...Casper and Scooter Lindley especially unsettled... BUCKAROO BANZAI I'm working under the assumption that Penny still has the Overthruster. That'll be my job: get it back in one piece.  Here's the main gate. I'll pass through first, alone.  The rest of you divide into two strike groups-Apache Team...that's you, Reno...and Chaparral Team, Perfect Tommy.  John Parker'll ride with Chaparral. Perfect Tommy not too thrilled about that. BUCKAROO BANZAI Top priority is the Overthruster. Whorfin can't escape without it. The built-in tracking device should make it relatively simple to locate...maybe hard to get. INT.

PRESIDENT WIDMARK What's happening with my call to SAC? NATIONAL SECURITY MAN Still no confirmation either from SAC or Strategic Space Command.  They report all surveillance satellite communication jammed. PRESIDENT WIDMARK Jammed--? By who? Whom by? NATIONAL SECURITY MAN Possible atmospheric condition, sir...solar.  It's unusual, but no cause for alarm.  Intelligence reports the Soviets are having the same problem. PRESIDENT WIDMARK Should we be on Code Red? GENERAL CATBURD We go to Code Red, the Russians go to Code Red...no sense jumping off half-cocked, Mr. President. The President twisting around to glower at Catburd eating an orange, sitting near a table of flowers and fruit baskets. SENATOR CUNNINGHAM I don't know...Buckaroo Banzai's never been wrong before. Senator Cunningham pacing nervously... GENERAL CATBURD The man went through solid matter, for crying out loud. Who knows what it did to his brain...maybe scrambled his molecules. All I'm saying is, let's not panic here!  I'm sure there's a rational explanation... NATIONAL SECURITY ADVISOR (turning from a strange phone) Russian radar is down, sir.  They've just gone to Code Red. Silence.  And then calmly and quietly: PRESIDENT WIDMARK We've got no choice then.  Call my wife. The National Security Advisor turning back to his telephone: NATIONAL SECURITY ADVISOR Code Red.  \"Butch says we're crimson.\" GENERAL CATBURD Mr. President, none of us here are lunatics or irrational men... (looking at Cunningham) ...or persons.  I'm a soldier and I'm a damn good one, enough decorations to snap a Christmas tree, but I don't mind telling you, I'm sure I speak for everyone in this room when I say I am scared. I'm barely holding my fudge right now. SENATOR CUNNINGHAM Stop acting like a goddamn schoolgirl, General, and pull yourself together. PRESIDENT WIDMARK I'm glad someone has the balls to face facts! (pause) Forget we're the good guys and we'd never attack first.  They think we're godless monsters just like them.  Put yourself in their samovars...sitting in the dark without radar, bells ringing all over the damn Kremlin, little men in fedora hats getting out of Zils, coming into the Great Hall of the People.  Now, do you think they're gonna listen to reason?  I'll give Buckaroo his Planet 10 space cloud, but do you think they will? NATIONAL SECURITY ADVISOR (being handed a dispatch) Soviet radar is down, sir, and so is ours.  We're both totally defenseless.  More or less. GENERAL CATBURD Hail Mary. PRESIDENT WIDMARK So what's our counter option, General Catburd?  Earn your salary. GENERAL CATBURD I guess we have to prick this boil and take the heat, sir.  Hit 'em primero...blast 'em off the face of the Earth before they lose their heads and do it to us first. PRESIDENT WIDMARK Larry, where's my Football? NATIONAL SECURITY ADVISOR Out in the hall, sir. INT.  WALTER REED HOSPITAL CORRIDOR - NIGHT        326 An apple-cheeked Marine Lieutenant sits watching a television soap opera, only the sinister BLACK BRIEFCASE chained to his wrist setting him apart from missions of other viewers...General Catburd sticking his head out of the President's room... GENERAL CATBURD What're you waiting for, boy?  Get in here with that thing. ...as an out-of-breath Mrs. Johnson rounds the corner on rollerskates, out-foxing SECRET SERVICE AGENTS and the rest of the President's entourage, cutting through, clutching the YELLOW RECORD... MRS. JOHNSON For the President!  From Buckaroo Banzai! EXT.  RENDEZVOUS POINT - NIGHT        327 A dimly lighted parking lot not far from Yoyodyne.  A KOLODNY BROS. PLUMBING VAN arrives, disgorging several tough BLUE SHIELDS as Buckaroo and Professor Hikita confer...the alien John Parker doing some highly unusual warm-up exercises on the tarmac...Reno telling the arriving Blue Shields: RENO We're waiting for the Jet Car.  Billy's bringing it. PERFECT TOMMY Asshole probably got lost. NEW JERSEY Or nailed for speeding. BUCKAROO BANZAI Can I have everyone's attention?  I'm not a rah-rah kinda guy, and I'm not much for speeches, but things could get rough out there tonight. It's a fight we didn't ask for, but it's a fight we're stuck with and we all saw what happened to Rawhide.  So if for any reason this is good-bye, I want you all to know that...well...that...you crazy lugs... Buckaroo finding it difficult to put into words what they all mean to him, the Cavaliers smiling, needling him... RENO What, Buckaroo?  You trying to tell us something? The JET CAR racing up, skidding to a stop, Billy jumping out, the big engine still running. BUCKAROO BANZAI Let's just fry those arachtoids. Buckaroo embracing Professor Hikita, turning back to his men, pulling on his helmet: BUCKAROO BANZAI Give me thirty minutes.  Then come in and mop up. Buckaroo tossing a quick Blue Shield salute, shutting himself into his speed machine.",
