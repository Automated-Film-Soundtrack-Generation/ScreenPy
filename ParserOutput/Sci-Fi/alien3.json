She raises her torch and heads down the new corridor alone. The cells here have no doors. She holds her torch in one -- An old skeleton sits in quiet contemplation.

John looks back and sees that Ripley has moved ahead without them, then reaches down to help Anthony. Their hands clasp -- ANTHONY HAS A \"VISION\" He is seemingly standing in an open field, sheep grazing peacefully at his side. SUDDENLY he is ATTACKED by a horde of Medieval demons. Fish faced demons.  Man-headed bird demons. They fly about him, grab hold of his limbs. The Sheep nearest him opens it's mouth to reveal a horde of razor sharp fangs, SINKS THEM INTO HIS ANKLE -- Anthony SCREAMS -! RIPLEY Down the corridor HEARS the scream, turns back -- sees Anthony fighting with himself, struggling against John's grasp - ANTHONY Balanced precariously on the top of the ladder in the real world as he fights against the demons in his android mind -- He JERKS -- Pulls his left ankle out of the grasp of the DEMON SHEEP -- OFF the ladder - forty foot drop waiting below him... JOHN Struggles to keep his death grip on Anthony's hand. It's all that keeps Anthony from falling back down the shaft -- JOHN Jesus Christ.  Ripleeeee -! He PULLS with all his might... ANTHONY SEES a horrible BIRD-DEMON grasping his hand in its beak -- BITING through his wrist.  He waves his staff in the air -- He aims for its head: CRACK -! WHACKS John's hand with his staff -- John HOWLS in pain - LETS GO -- Anthony TEETERS BACK ON ONE FOOT, arms waving in the air -- Ripley's hands SHOOT OUT -- GRAB Anthony's cassock -- STOP his fall. Anthony's eyes open wide at the sight of this new horror -- A terrible, wet, black cable-armed CREATURE that's latched itself onto his cassock -- Long, shiny head. Ripley has become the Alien. WHACK! Anthony HITS the Creature with his staff -- HITS Ripley on the head. WHACK! Again.  In the face. John tries to take hold of Anthony's staff arm -- WHACK! The cane WHIPS against the side of his head, knocking him back. Ripley sets her feet and pulls on Anthony's cassock -- Opens her mouth - GRUNTS -- ANTHONY sees the terrible Alien open it's maw to devour him. WHACK! His staff connects with the bridge of Ripley's nose. She sees flashes of light -- loses her balance -- Pitches forward, starts to go over with Anthony -- JOHN GRABS THEM! Wraps his arms around the struggling pair and like a sumo wrestler LIFTS and FALLS backwards - carrying the three of them into the corridor -- WHUMPH! They land on the floor in a heap. Anthony continues to FLAIL ABOUT -- Ripley and John pin him to the floor between them. Finally, the vision leaves him. He loses consciousness. JOHN Breathing heavy - opens his eyes -- He's staring right into Ripley's face. Less than an inch away. He's laying on top of her. She's breathing heavy too. A long, uncomfortable moment.",
