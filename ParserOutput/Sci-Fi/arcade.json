Now he's reached ground floor... INT. GROUND FLOOR HALLWAY - DAY BOOM!  Nick tumbles out of the stairwell only to see a trio of GUARDS heading straight for him. Nick drops his board to the ground and heads right, pumping his foot... One of the GUARDS leaps at him and... ...misses by a foot or so, CRASHING to the tile floor. NICK SCREECHES to another stop, TWISTS, and starts pumping down another hallway... INT. LOADING AREA -- DAY Nick plows into the loading area like a bullet, whipping around stacks of boxes and lumbering forklifts.  A few WORKERS attempt to stop him, but he's moving too fast. AHEAD, is a loading dock, raised four feet from the ground to accommodate semis. Nick's heading for it.  The loading door is open, and outside is freedom. JUST THEN, the steel loading door begins to GRIND and lower.  Some genius has hit the controls. NICK pumps like mad, and he's really moving now.  Either he'll make it, or he's going to hit that steel door at about forty miles and hour... THE DOOR is quickly closing off Nick's escape route.  He's only got about four feet to negotiate... Nick ducks low and clears it! EXT. LOADING DOCK -- DAY Nick ROCKETS off the loading dock, through the air and down, hitting the concrete driveway.  The driveway peels off to the left and slopes downward. Nick hangs tight, hugs the curve, and picks up more speed. BELOW, the driveway splits off.  To the left, SLIP-STREAM's main building, and to the right, the parking lot. GUARDS are piled into an electric cart, SPEEDING up from the left to cut Nick off.  It's going to be close... Nick forks off to the right dust before they reach him. It's clear sailing now, and up ahead, Nick can see Alex pulling up to the end of the driveway... WHOOSH!  Nick scrapes the board forward, grinding the wheels sideways in order to slow his speed... He leaps. picking the board up with him. and dunks himself smack-dab in the back seat of the Skylark. ALEX guns the engine and tears away in a cloud of exhaust. EXT. COUNTRY ROAD -- DAY Nick is in the back seat, LAUGHING.  The sun is beginning its descent and the sky is taking on a reddish tint.",

The human body is 95% water, and Nick EXPLODES like a water balloon on high impact, blood spraying in a fine mist across the dunes, Alex, and everything for a good fifty yards. Alex is frozen with terror.  You remember your worst childhood nightmare monster?  The one you'd see in your room at night as your brain cooked with fever?  Too paralyzed to call out for Mom?  Well that's the Screamer. THE SCREAMER stands where Nick used to be (a red mess on the blue sand now).  Black as night.  Like living, roiling lava. Smoking, charged RED EYES.  One third demon, one third Balrog, and one third rotting corpse.  Clad in chains and samurai armor, CLINKING as it moves.  It rear back its head, opens a fanged mouth, and lets loose a ROAR designed to shake the stars from the sky. Then it focuses it's eyes on Alex.  And it charges. ALEX unfreezes.  She's got seconds to make up her mind, the doorway/mouth or the Screamer.  It's really no choice at all.  Alex turns and dives straight down into the pulsing mouth. The jaws of the rabbit hole SNAP shut around her.  Darkness consumes everything. These words appear on screen, \"LEVEL THREE -- TOWER OF GHOSTS\" CUT TO: EXT.  LEVEL FOUR, VOLCANO -- DAY We are looking at a steep cliff face composed of black, volcanic rock. This world is desaturated, gray, and harsh. The rocks looks sharp as razors. As we will discover, the cliff face is also composed of skulls, old and blackened, set inside the rock. We hear a HUMMING and Alex \"fades in\", appearing on the side of the cliff face.  Immediately she starts to fall, realizes where she is, and hugs the cliff for dear life. Rock shards crumble away beneath her feet.  Alex looks down ... Big mistake. She hugs the cliff face tighter, tears and grime streaking her face. She's alone now and she knows it.  She looks up ... It's a long way to go. Alex reaches a hand upward.  Ouch!  The rock's hot.  She jerks her hand back and almost loses her perch. HER HAND Her gloves are smoking and singed. Alex starts to cry freely now.  She reaches inside her chestplate, fumbling, and pulls something out... It's the Polaroid of her and Greg.  But then the wind catches it and tears it from her hand. THE POLAROID twists downward, round and round into infinity. Alex stares after it a moment.  Then she lets out a tired little laugh and starts to climb. A SERIES OF DISSOLVES... as Alex climbs, sometimes using a skull itself as a hand or foothold. We see her \"TIME ELAPSED\" blocks blinking away. Time running out and more climbing.  Then... EXT.  LEVEL FOUR, VOLCANO RIM -- DAY Alex stands on the rim of the volcano.  At her feet is a golden key.  And before her, a big drop. ALEX'S WRIST DISPLAY Her final block of time disappears.  The BEEPING starts. Alex doesn't even pause.

And at the last possible second before impact... BLINK!  A stylized figure appears on her wrist-display next to the \"TIME ELAPSED\" meter.  Beneath the figure it says \"FREE LIFE\". Alex feels the breath of the Screamer on her face and falls back through the doorway... \"LEVEL SIX -- SHOCK CORRIDOR\" CUT TO: INT.  LEVEL SIX, SHOCK CORRIDOR -- NIGHT Alex steps out of a doorway into a long, narrow hallway. The hallway is mirrored on one side.  It has no doors or windows, and up ahead, it branches off to the right and the left. Alex turns and looks behind her.  The doorway she came through is gone now.  A mirrored wall stands in its place, with her own reflection staring back at her. THE REFLECTION There are subtle changes.  They shouldn't be noticeable at first, but the reflection seems somehow more threatening. Alex starts down the hall, her reflection keeping pace with her.  Up ahead, she hears a BUZZING noise, drawing closer. LIGHT flickers in the hallway to the left, presumably whatever it is that's BUZZING.  Suddenly a streak of light, running along the floor, turns the corner and heads down the hallway towards Alex. The light hits her feet and SPARKS fly.  Alex SCREAMS and is thrown back against the wall, shocked.  The streak of light continues past her and disappears into the mirror at the hall's end.  It's like a moving electrical pulse. ALEX She's been given a pretty good jolt.  Her hands shake for a moment, an after-seizure of sorts, and she stands... HER MIRRORED REFLECTION is watching her, arms crossed.  This wouldn't be a problem were it not for the fact that Alex currently doesn't have her arms crossed!",

BUZZZZZ!!!  Here comes another streak of light, rushing in along the floor from a side corridor... Alex LEAPS over it, and it passes harmlessly under her. Now she's getting the hang of it.  She starts forward again. BUZZZZZ!!!  Here come two at a time from opposite directions... Alex has to jump left to avoid the first streak and lands directly in the path of the second.  Then she jumps back to the right again... THE TWO STREAKS pass by, zipping away from each other. ANOTHER CORRIDOR The pace quickens, with Alex racing down the corridors. She turns corner after corner.  It's become a virtual maze. We cut back to Alex's \"STRENGTH\" and \"TIME ELAPSED\" meters again and again.  Both are shrinking away to nothing. And all the while, her reflection keeps pace with her, growing increasingly more nightmarish in appearance.  As Alex tires, the reflection seems to gain more strength. BUZZZZZ!!!  BUZZZZZ!!!  The streaks are shooting towards her with more frequency, and now they're racing along the walls too.  Alex is jumping left and right, with SPARKS exploding around her. THE REFLECTION seems to be metamorphosizing.  Each time we see it/her, she looks a little different.  What's gradually happening (as time elapses) is that Alex's reflection is turning into The Screamer. Alex moves with increasing urgency as the streaks converge on her.  The corridors are filled with a constant BUZZING and flickering of light. SPARKS fly and Alex is shocked over and over. She stumbles, falls to the floor, and rolls to the right, just missing a streak.  It cuts past her face, centimeters away. BEEP!  BEEP!  BEEP!  Off goes her wrist display!  Alex is up and running now, desperate. We cut faster and faster  Alex running, the streaks of light, the reflection until... END CORRIDOR She's back where she started.  And the corridor dead-ends in a mirrored wall... BEHIND ALEX, Dozens of light streaks are dogging her heels, literally just behind her. They're so thick that she couldn't possibly leap over all of them. Seconds before they reach her. AHEAD OF ALEX, the mirror shows her own reflection, rushing closer.  Her wrist display indicates that time is up with a prolonged BEEP and her own reflection vanishes.  It's the Screamer in her reflection's place.  Only it's rocketing towards her in the mirror.  It's in front of her this time, instead of behind her. Rock and a fucking hard place.  Light streaks or Screamers? It's really no choice at all.  Her guts says \"Screamer\". Alex leaps and SMASHES into the mirror at full speed.  The world is filled with SHATTERING GLASS and a shower of infinite reflections and then we...",

It's Laurie and Stilts.  They are dressed completely in black, hair slicked back and eyes empty.  White-faced Gothic harlequins.  Each is holding a wooden staff, staring into space.",

Monitor screens shatter, glass flies and... ...just like that, total silence descends.  One by one, the lights blink off, and it's dark once again. INT. LEVEL TEN, THE NIGHT ROOM -- A SPOTLIGHT comes on, isolating Alex.  The boy stands behind her, and everything else is dark.  It's impossible to tell how large the room is.  It might go on forever. MORE LIGHTS come on now, pin-point spots illuminating the faces of her friends. They're all there...Stilts, Laurie, the others. Even Nick.  They sit in rows, motionless...a peanut gallery.  It's eerie as hell. And now, Alex sees something else, Greg.  He's encased in a block of ice. A frozen prince.  And in his hands he holds a sword.  The sword is very unusual.  The hilt is shaped like a heart and it glows RED as if it had just pulled from a furnace.  Alex realizes that the sword is ARCADE'S heart. Alex moves towards Greg.  As she gets closer, she sees a keyhole carved into the ice. Alex knows what to do.  She withdraws her belt on which the nine golden keys are attached.
