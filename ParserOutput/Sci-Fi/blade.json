Brutal \"DARKCORE\" along the lines of Prodigy or Underground. Raquel pulls Dennis out onto the dance floor. They sway. A lupine-featured GAULTIER GIRL with a streak of white running through her raven hair moves in behind Dennis, pressing up against him. Rachel Williams as the Angel of Death -- we'll call her MERCURY. Mercury flicks her tongue against Dennis' ear -- it's been pierced with a silver post which clicks against her teeth. Tattooed across her back in black is a swirling, tribal vortex. Dennis is now sandwiched between Raquel and Mercury, the three of them dry-humping their way to every man's glory. The beat gets LOUDER. The action heavier. The atmosphere more narcotic. People are stripping off their clothes, sweating like fiends. It's a virtual orgy. Dennis laughs, reveling in the hedonism. Everything rises to a fever pitch -- DENNIS (over the music) Fuck, I need a drink!!! Raquel just smiles -- then Dennis notices a DROP OF SOMETHING spatter his hand. It looks like blood. Dennis looks up, concerned -- -- MORE BLOOD DROPLETS are falling. Raquel's face is sprinkled with them now. Dennis stops dancing. What is this? Some kind of fucked up performance art? Raquel turns her face toward the ceiling, as if washing herself in a summer shower, now the other club goers are looking up too -- BLOOD SHOWERS DOWN from sprinkler heads in the ceiling, drenching the dancers. The club goers love it, thrusting their heads back, mouths open wide to receive the crimson offering. Horrified, Dennis recoils, turning towards -- RAQUEL, whose face morphs into a preternatural snarl. Her canines extend, tapering to razor-sharp points. Her tongue flicks, lizard-like as fingernails sharpen into claws. All this while the whites of her eyes",

Both creatures tumble forward, their bodies liquefying into puddles of black oil which go gurgling down the run-off drains. Blade continues FIRING, then -CLICK!- magazines empty. Next. He holsters the Casulls, swings up his assault rifle, calmly flicks on the UV entry light mounted above -- MERCURY leaps twenty feet straight up into the air. We've never seen anything move so fast. She CRASHES through a glass skylight, disappearing into the night just as -- -- a shaft of blinding UV \"sunlight\" cuts across the vampires. They rear back, skin smoking from the light's corrosive effects. Blade opens FIRE, pumping round after round of wooden fragmentation bullets into the crowd -- vampire genocide. The strobe lights flicker as the mayhem mounts. Some of the vampires try to flee, scurrying up the stairs, but the exit quickly becomes clogged with liquefying bodies -- -- then Blade's CAR-15 jams. The remaining club-goers see their opening, surge forward en masse -- Blade drops the rifle, reaches over his shoulder and -SCHINGGG!- unsheathes his sword with a double-handed grip. THE SWORD Four acid-etched feet of blood-soaked Damascus steel. An edge so sharp it could cleave a shadow in two. Blade moves like lightning, hacking his way into TWO CHARGING VAMPIRES. Blade spins again, cuts ANOTHER VAMPIRE clean in half -- ON THE FAR END OF THE CLUB, a LATEX-CLAD VAMP makes a break for it. Blade flings his sword, sending it spinning end over end -- THUNK! The sword punches into the vampire's heart. The hellish creature convulses, dies. Beat. Blade retrieves his sword, then senses -- SOMETHING BIG rising up behind him. In a flash, Blade swings his sword downward, cutting off the vampire's right hand at the elbow. The severed limb falls to the floor -- -- but it doesn't slow the hulking creature down. It SLAMS into Blade. Blade flies backwards thirty feet, tumbling over tables, slamming into the rear wall so hard that plaster rains down from the ceiling. Blade suddenly finds himself wrestling with a feral-faced six-foot- something nightmare named QUINN. The vampire rears back its head, jaws stretching wide. Every inch of his face is covered with ritual scarification patterns and Maori-like tribal tattoos. Blade forces an elbow against Quinn's throat, trying to keep him at bay. With his other hand he reaches to his bandoleer, pulls out a stake -- CRUNCH! Blade shoves the stake through the vampire's larynx. Quinn gurgles, clutches at his throat. Blade rolls out from under, unholsters the cross-bow secured to his leg. With a flick of a switch the arms of the bow -SNAP!- open, drawing the bow-string taut. Blade FIRES -- The bolt hits Quinn in the shoulder, throwing him backwards and nailing him to the wall. As Quinn reaches over with his other hand to pull out the stake -- Blade FIRES AGAIN. A second bolt slams into Quinn's other arm, effectively pinning him like a butterfly to a board.",

On the wall is a collection of knives and daggers. Some of them wooden, their hilts inscribed with bizarre- looking runes. In the center of these weapons rests -- BLADE'S SWORD, hanging like a cross in a chapel, dominating all else. Karen touches it. Then her eyes drop to a silver locket which dangles from the hilt by a tarnished chain. She reaches for it, opens it -- The locket features a photo, old and faded. It's the black woman we saw in the prologue, Vanessa, standing in the sunshine. Karen moves towards the door, cautious -- INT. WHISTLER'S WORKSHOP - DAY We hear VOICES now, coming from beyond a series of black-out curtains. Karen pushes one aside and SEES -- BLADE strapped into some kind of Inquisition-esque restraint chair. His shirt is off, his body slick with sweat. Whistler finishes strapping Blade in, then stands back, holding up a gas-powered pistol injector, hesitant -- WHISTLER I had to increase the dose. You're building up a resistance to the serum -- BLADE (impatient) Just do it, old man. Whistler nods, fitting Blade with a bite guard. Then he presses the pistol-injector against Blade's carotid artery. Blade shakes violently, grinding his teeth through the bite guard, veins cording in his neck. He clutches Whistler's hand, holding it tightly as he fights his way through the hellish seizure. To his credit, Whistler never lets go. Mentor and student stare at one another as the mysterious serum runs its violent course. We understand that these shared moments, oddly private in their horror, are the glue which binds the two vampire hunters together. Finally, Blade slumps forward in his restraints, exhausted. KAREN She draws back, instinctively knowing that she's just witnessed something she shouldn't have. She looks for an exit, SEES another doorway. She makes for it -- INT. WHISTLER'S LAB - TANK ROOM - DAY A dusty, darkened hole of a room, no windows, just shadows, crumbling concrete, rust stains, and -- A LARGE TANK filled with swirling blood plasma, choked with electrical leads and biomedical sensors. SOMETHING floats within, suspended in the murky fluid -- a child , two or three years of age, drifting about like a medical oddity preserved in formaldehyde -- THUMP! The child SLAMS up against the glass. Karen backpedals, startled. Its eyes are open now, pupils blown. It snarls, revealing a mouthful of razored fangs, trailing mouth-slime across the glass as it futilely tries to chew its way through to Karen. Karen stifles a sob, turning and running right into -- BLADE, who now blocks the exit, sword in hand. Karen retreats a step, wary -- BLADE You shouldn't be here.",

Blade enters, Karen at his heels -- The 'Pearl' is an all-hours strip club cum casino catering exclusively to Japanese zaibatsu clientele. Dimly lit, the air thick with cigarette smoke, deafening MUSIC. Go boards, pachinko machines, sexy little MANGA WAIFS in schoolgirl outfits doling out drinks -- STRIPPERS writhe in the circular \"pit\" tables surrounded by HOWLING grab-ass men. But that's nothing compared to -- The MAIN ATTRACTION, who's doing a bump and grind down the runway, shaking a body worthy of a schoolboy's wet dream. Her attire? A leather S&M face mask, nipple rings, 6-inch spikes, and a pair of panties to hide her modesty. Blade scans the room -- just in time to see Tanaka ducking into a back hallway. Blade pushes towards the rear of the club. Karen follows. ON THE STRIPPER as she catches sight of Blade and freezes in mid-routine. The stripper pulls off her hood. Long black hair with a streak of white tumbles down her back -- it's Mercury. INT. BLACK PEARL, HALLWAY - NIGHT Blade and Karen head past the bathrooms. At the end of the hall is a door marked \"OFFICE\". Just then, the Men's door opens, a DRUNK COLLEGE KID steps out, SEES Blade -- KID Hey -- Blade plants a hand over the kid's face, shoving him back into the bathroom as he kicks open the office door -- INT. THE BLACK PEARL, BACK OFFICE - NIGHT Tanaka spins around, startled, tries to throw a punch -- Blade traps Tanaka's arm, levering the man up and over. He CRASHES into a shelving unit, taking the whole thing down with him. Karen winces. Blade grabs a handful of Tanaka's hair, yanks his head up -- BLADE Where's the entrance?!",

Hits it -- the bookcase slides aside, revealing a hidden elevator. As Blade moves to put his sunglasses back on -- BLADE'S POV (IN THE REFLECTION OF HIS SUNGLASSES) We see Tanaka behind him, pulling a handgun out of a desk drawer, swinging it up -- Blade unholsters one of his Casulls faster than any gunslinger in history.

As Blade draws his sword, the massive shadow freezes -- PEARL'S VOICE (frightened) Lorca, is that you? Blade slides open the nearest shoji screen -- INT. PEARL'S BED CHAMBER - NIGHT Nothing Karen's seen up until this point could prepare her for the archive's curator -- PEARL, a nine-hundred-pound androgynous vampire of Asian origin, lounging amidst pillowed rice mats, wearing a communications headset. Think of a cross between Divine and Jabba The Hutt. Skin the complexion of buttermilk, so corpulent he can barely move, so engorged with blood that he's actually sweating it from the pores of his skin. Pearl is surrounded by a nest of monitors and keyboards which have been affixed to counter-balanced arms -- this way, Pearl can access information without leaving bed. Lying next to Pearl, dwarfed by the vampire's massive size, is the chalk-white body of a recently-drained NAKED BOY.

He balances the rifle against his hip like an over-the-hill gunslinger and OPENS FIRE on the vampires. Blade rolls, snatching up a fragment of the parchment which has blown free from the vault. Seconds later, he and Karen are fleeing after Whistler, retreating back through his newly created exit.",

Blade brings the sword down on Quinn's good arm, cutting it off at the wrist! Quinn falls to the tracks, tumbling head over heels back into the darkness -- THE AMPUTATED HAND, which continues to clutch at Blade's ankle, starts to melt. With a cry of disgust, Blade kicks the thing away. He turns and climbs through the window -- INT. SUBWAY CAR - NIGHT Karen helps Blade inside. He sinks to the floor of the otherwise deserted car, exhausted. He's looking ashen now. The whites of his eyes are shot through with red. Karen gets a good look at Blade's wounds -- the front of his jacket is soaked in blood. She reaches for him -- KAREN You're hurt -- BLADE Nothing that won't heal by dawn. Blade reaches into his jacket and pulls out the small, gas-powered pistol-injector we saw Whistler inject him with earlier. He tries to load one of the ampoules into it, but because of his wounds, he's not having much luck -- BLADE (frustrated) I need help with this -- Karen nods, inserting the ampoule into the gun. Blade shrugs off his jacket, holds out his arm. Karen pauses -- KAREN What am I injecting you with?",

Frost and his compatriots are blown off their feet by the sheer intensity of the occult blast -- a blast which sends the skeletal bodies of the Elders SLAMMING into the rock wall.

Karen SCREAMS. Whistler is knocked to the floor, the flashlight spinning from his hand -- The feral child lands atop Whistler, HISSING like a cobra. Its macrocephalic head seems to morph, twisting into grotesque proportions. And just as it's about to strike -- ZZZZING! Whistler withdraws a silver rapier which had been hidden inside his cane. He lunges forward -- WHOOSH! The child takes off like a blue streak, sending test tubes and medical equipment CRASHING to the floor. It zips past Karen -- WHISTLER Get it!!! Karen snatches up the flashlight, chasing after it as Whistler struggles to his feet -- Karen sweeps the flashlight around, catching only fleeting glimpses of the child as it darts through the workshop. She reaches a shelving unit where Whistler's weapons are stored, grabs one of the modified pistols -- Karen tries to draw a bead on the creature. She FIRES, misses, FIRES again -- she's getting more unnerved as the seconds tick by and the creature is moving closer and -- -- suddenly it's right in front of her, flying through the air, fangs bared! The child knocks Karen back against the wall. It's at her throat, sinking its claws into her neck. Karen chokes, forcing Whistler's pistol under the monstrosity's chin -- -- but then the creature morphs again, transforming into a beatific little cherubim of a child -- and Karen hesitates, because the child seems so goddamned human now and its eyes are luminous, pulsing and hypnotic and -- -- suddenly Whistler reaches in from behind, YANKING the vampire child's head back, FIRING a pistol into its skull. The creature slumps -- Karen cries out, disgusted, flinging the corpse away from her. As it continues to writhe -- THUNK! Whistler swings his cane-rapier down on the creature, brutally decapitating it. Finishing the job. Then he looks to Karen, winded.",

Karen looks to the ground, reaching for one of the splintered femurs. She pounds it into the mortar between two bricks -- and it holds, working as a makeshift piton. Karen reaches for another broken femur, lodging it a foot above the first. She hauls her body up now, suspending her weight from the two makeshift pitons. Again, they hold. Trembling from exertion, Karen pulls the right piton free, hanging solely from her left hand now. Though her handhold is precarious, she manages to swing the right hand up again, pounding that piton another foot above the left.

We hear the RASP and CLANG of metal on metal as Blade manages to trap the sword-point between two of the dagger blades -- For a moment, both men are eye to eye, their weapons locked together, then, Frost forces Blade backwards -- What happens next is the most blindingly-fast sword fight ever exposed to celluloid. Both men, fueled by super-human speed, lunge and spin across the cavern floor in a blurred ballet of lethal moves. Frost lands a powerful blow on Blade's shoulder, the sword-edge biting deep into the flesh. Blade SCREAMS. Frost withdraws the sword for another strike -- -- until Blade sees an opening and takes it, slicing Frost's left arm off at the shoulder -- The severed arm releases Blade's sword, but the arm doesn't fall! To Frost and Blade's mutual surprise the arm floats in mid-air, bleeding red, quivering like zero-G liquid, then SLURPING back to Frost's arm- stump to re-attach itself! Undaunted, Blade slices the punching dagger into Frost's mid-section, meeting only liquid-like resistance. The moment Blade withdraws his dagger, Frost's flesh seals itself up again. Blade hesitates now, uncertain -- and Frost laughs, understanding what has happened.",
