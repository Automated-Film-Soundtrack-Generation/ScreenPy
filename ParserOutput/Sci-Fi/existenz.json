MINUTES LATER - NIGHT A SHORT MONTAGE as the twenty-one volunteers mount the dais and are fitted with their game gear: The assistants undo the heavy-duty snap locks and split open the ski-boot-like plastic modules on the back table. Inside, resting in a lining of dense foam, are what look almost like living kidneys: the MetaFlesh Game-Pods. Coiled in each boot toe is the Y-shaped, multi-player UmbyCord that comes with each pod, a split twelve-foot connector cord that resembles an umbilical cord, twisted, translucent, blue and red veiny vessels running just below the surface. The volunteers watch in hushed reverence, as though about to receive communion. The game-pods are gingerly lifted out of their cases. The UmbyCords are uncoiled and plugged into ports in the back of the game-pods. The shirts, blouses, and jackets of the volunteers are lifted at the back to reveal their owners' bioports, which are small, soft-plastic, flesh-coloured permanent spinal jacks positioned just above the belt line. Twenty-two folding chairs are placed in a circle on the dais. As each volunteer has his UmbyCord plugged into his bioport, he takes one of the seats and places his quivering, rippling game-pod, now connected directly to his nervous system, on his lap. The last chair is taken by Allegra Geller, who is fussed i over and settled by Levi as she unpacks her own master game- pod with exaggerated delicacy and is then ported in to the players on either side of her. We END the short MONTAGE with the security guard, Pikul, standing with arms folded near the church's side door, watching the proceedings with fascination. A loud knocking at the door forces Pikul to turn away from the action on the dais. He walks over to the door and opens it. A hyper, exasperated fan almost tumbles into the church. Pikul immediately raises his electronic wand and bars his way.",

In the case, we watch as Dichter tears open his obsolete game-pod to reveal a bizarre weapon, a pistol made of bone and gristle, almost like the half-decayed body of a small mammal - whose snout is the barrel, whose rigid hind leg is the trigger. Dichter takes his weapon out of its case, shakes off a few gelatinous strips of game-pod flesh, and steps up onto the dais. Pikul is the first to notice this. He glances at Levi, who's still blissed out and humming, then launches himself awkwardly through the crowd.

The circle of players on the dais moans as one, swoons and jostles: they are all feeling the neural surge of Geller's traumatized nervous system. Peeking out from under her folding chair, Geller's eyes are wide with fear and confusion. She clutches her shoulder without being aware of it. Blood seeps in between her fingers Now Levi and his two assistants scramble onto the platform to get at Dichter, who fires wildly, hitting two of the players nearest Geller. The circle of players immediately goes spastic, screaming and twitching and dropping to the ground and writhing. Many of them are clutching their shoulders in the same spot as Geller, sympathy pain transmitting through their UmbyCords. Pikul manages to tackle Dichter, then starts whacking at him with the security wand. Dichter twists around and raises his weapon at Pikul, who immediately backs off in terror. But before Dichter can pull the trigger, the two assistants produce small, normal pistols from hidden holsters and empty their clips into the prostrate Dichter. Dichter manages to squeeze off one last shot at the approaching Jevi, hitting him squarely in the chest. Levi goes down and is lost amongst the jostling feet. The watching fans pile onto the dais and begin to help the players unplug from the game-pods which are obviously causing them distress. Three of the players attack the dying Dichter, dragging their game-pods after them, kicking at whatever part of him they can find in the confused mass of bodies. in the turmoil, Pikul is knocked to the ground.

Pikul stares at it, fascinated, horrified. He turns back to Levi, but Levi's eyes are rolling back as he loses consciousness. The two assistants are making their way towards them through the shoving, shuffling throng, guns cocked, faces set hard. Panicked, Pikul jams the bone gun into his suit pocket and jumps off the platform, wildly looking around for Geller.

It beats its large, papery wings wildly in order to pull itself upright and then begins the whole clumsy process all over again.

The belt begins and ends in the anonymous smoky innards of the building. The place, a high-ceilinged pre-fab, long and narrow with hundreds of blanked-out windows, houses a game-pod assembly line.

There, pods very much like the one he and Geller are ported into back home are being assembled - motherboards inserted, internal ports connected, fleshy housings like the corpses of small amphibians sewn up - by small teams of workers. The bays themselves are old horse stalls with straw still covering the dirt floors. But because the pods are primarily organic, the teams are more like groups of masked surgical workers in a series of impossibly small and filthy operating rooms than, let's say, auto-assembly teams in a progressive Saab plant. As Pikul wheels his cart past each stall, he digs into the cart's canvas bag and delivers insect boards wrapped in brown wax paper to the eagerly awaiting pod teams. In the last bay, one of the masked surgeons grabs him by the hand instead of taking the proferred motherboard pnd leads himm to an isolated corner.

But there are many differences between then and now, Geller is sitting in her chair on the dais as before, her eyes just beginning to flutter open. But Pikul is sitting next to her, also playing the game. And next to him is Nourish, whom we are even more surprised to see in this context. Aad in fact, the players who are sitting in the circle of chairs on the dais are all characters who have been in the movie up to this point: Nader, the cashier, Dichter, Gas, Vinkokur, even Frances, the limo driver. The players are all emerging from a game that has just ended - the movie we have been watching - and they begin to stir in their game gear, which is nothing like the organic pod- technology we have just seen. On the contrary, the garners are wearing head-gear with electrodes, more like normal clunky Virtual-Reality equipment, and are linked by mundane wires. In their laps they hold, not game-pods, but sleek plastic game modules, each about the size of a walkman, with holes into Which I their left thumbs are inserted - a simpler and cruder version of the bioports we have become used to. Watching the proceedings from down on the church floor are two security guards, neither of whom is Pikul, of course. On a leash, one of the security guards holds the dog that, in the game, picked up the gristle gun in the Chinese restaurant. Also monitoring the action are a woman, Merle, who is the game's actual project manager - the real-life version of the game-character Levi - and her two assistants. There is a collective sigh as the game finally releases the players, and now they are free to remove their thumbs from the game modules and slide their head-gear off. The two assistants - the real-life ones are both matronly women - begin to help everyone unplug, neatly gathering up the equipment in padded bags as they go. A broadly smiling Merle mounts the dais and stands in the centre of the ring of players.",
