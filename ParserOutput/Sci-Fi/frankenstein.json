The Creature dangles below us from the ceiling-hoist, lying full-length and horizontal on its steel grate, spinning slowly, thick copper wires trailing from its arms and legs, rib cage and neck, armpits and groin. The copper cables trail upward, coil along the ceiling like garden hose to provide necessary slack, meander down the wall to culminate in a splendiferous array of galvanic batteries, steam engines and generators. Frankenstein reaches slowly up, fingertips straining toward the ceiling as if worshipping the creation revolving endlessly above his head in a perfectly-described circle not at all unlike the Da Vinci... And he grabs the lever on the platform and pulls to start it spinning, with a mighty heave, he sets the whole thing gliding in motion, CAMERA TRACKING FASTER AND FASTER as he rolls it along the ceiling track through the lab, passing table after table of desiccated leftovers and discarded scraps, LIGHTNING BLAZING through the windows to mark his way with wild and sinister shadows... ...and he yanks the platform to a stop over the copper sarcophagus. Amniotic fluid steaming and murky within. He positions the platform, unties the rope, lowers the Creature down and down, lower and lower, sinking into the vat, the steel grate a perfect fit in size and shape. Faster now, moving furiously. Reaching into the murk, unhooking the chains. Arraying the copper wire through air- tight guide holes. Spinning on his heels and reaching up, grabbing hold of the upper shell of the sarcophagus also suspended from the ceiling, stunningly heavy, gleaming with reflections and secrets. CAMERA ROCKETS DOWN on Victor as he swings the upper shell into position, lowers it into place with a THUD-CLANK! Working the wing-nuts on the bolts, spinning frantically, tightening them down, sealing the sarcophagus air-tight. Faster now. Faster. The frenzy builds and the CAMERA GOES WILD, rocketing, zooming, gliding, spinning the audience on its ear: Frankenstein. Turning up the heat on the burners. Cooking the copper from below. Double double, toil and trouble. Frankenstein. Gazing through the thick glass portholes checking on his creation drifting in the murk. Frankenstein. Whipping up the galvanic batteries, supercharging them with steam generators. Watching as they send voltage humming and throbbing through the copper cables along the ceiling beams. Building up a charge. Frankenstein. Gazing at his gleaming handiwork. LIGHTNING painting his features into a twisted mask. Hand on the switch. Ready to rev it up and throw the throttle. Over it goes. WHAM! Overdrive. The body convulses violently in its copper womb as the first jolt of electricity hits. THUNK-THUNK-THUNK! Blazing with energy and arcane light, fingers of light throbbing through the portholes, sparkling, glittering, seeking. Frankenstein races to the sarcophagus. A long glass tube, two feet in diameter and ribbed with steel, gets lowered on a boom and rammed into a hole, collate spun tight, inner dam wrenched out like a Polaroid plate. He reaches up and grabs holds of a pull-chain, fingers going knuckle-white on the wooden handle. One hard yank. A dump- tank is released, murky water cascading down the glass tube. And here's the final perversion, the ultimate icing on this twisted cake: the copper sarcophagus is literally a womb, with the giant glass tube serving as a massive gleaming phallus down which come pouring dozens of electric eels, wriggling and streaming like huge black sperm...",

Probably nothing. He lets the children lead him toward the table. The meal is brought from the stove and ladled out. The Creature eases back to the chink in the wall, smelling it from here.

Watching him. The figure starts running, leaping across the ice with great bounds. Right toward Victor. Victor wrenches the carved box from the saddle bag. The horse bolts. Victor drops to the snow, throws open the box, frantically snatches up the pair of revolvers. He glances up. The figure is gone, vanished in drifts of white.
