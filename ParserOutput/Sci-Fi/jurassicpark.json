With everything he's got, he lifts the incub ator waist-height.  And holds it. BACK ON MULDOON - Muldoon's footsteps ECHO as they come closer and closer to the garage.  Muldoon whips down the curve in the stairs.  His jacket catches on an incomplete section of banister. Yanks him to a stop. CLOSE ON - Muldoon's jacket as it RIPS, stays caught. BACK ON - NEDRY as he tries to heave higher, can't.  Beads a sweat roll down his brow. MULDOON FREES HIS caught jacket and then keep going. Nedry's face drips with sweat.  The incubator slips out of his sweaty palms.  Catches it with his knee.  Nedry curses and with one forceful boost, he lifts the incubator shoulder height. CLOSE ON - Muldoon's feet on long stairwell. BOOM. BOOM. BOOM. NERVOUS, NEDRY BREATHES in a labored fashion.  He looks this way and that.  He closes his eyes and with one superhuman effort, he heaves the incubator into the back seat of the red jeep.  Nedry exhales. At that moment, MULDOON ENTERS the vestibule between stairs and garage. NEDRY EYES the shadowy figure in the vestibule. Nedry's frightened face. MULDOON STOPS and reaches in his belt.  He pulls out his pistol.  He takes out long, shiny cartridges.  He loads the pistol. NEDRY LEAPS in the front of the jeep, pushing aside the rocket launcher, and zooms into the night. A moment later, Muldoon enters the garage.  He sniffs at the exhaust that still hangs in the air.  He looks over and is surprised to see his jeep gone.  He bends and inspects fresh tread marks. He looks up, his face straining to understand. EXT  PARK ROAD - NIGHT Nedry's red jeep flies down the park road. CLOSE ON - Nedry's wheel as he turns it. His tires skid sideways, then regain traction.  The jeep bolts up a smaller access road.  He skids to a stop at the top of the hill. Nedry jumps out and looks up.  His high beams illuminate a huge electric fence prominently labeled:  DANGER!  10,000 Volts! Two safety fences separate Nedry from the electric fence.  He races to the first one, pulls out a key chain.  He tries one key, then another, and another.  It f its.  Nedry unlocks the gate, swings open the door. Nedry runs to the second gate.  He slips in the mud.  He slides to the ground, dropping keys in a muddy pool. CLOSE ON - Nedry's hand frantically fishing for the key chain in the muddy water.  Got them!   Unlocks the second gate. He races to the electric fence.  RAIN PELTS him now.  Water beads on his face.  Lightning flashes on the 10,000 volts warning. He grabs the gate with his bare hand and swings it open. Nedry heads back to his jeep, his fat body strobed by its high beams. He jumps in the jeep and drives through.  Behind him, the open gates move recklessly in the stormy night. BACK ON GARAGE Ellie and Harding pull in, in their own gas-powered jeep.  Muldoon is waiting for them.  Now there's a rifle slung over his shoulder.  Harding jumps out of the jeep.",

The Rex begins to SHOVE the cruiser toward Grant and Lex.  They back up but they have very few feet left - they're almost at the embankment. But if they don't move, they'll by crushed by the oncoming car. Grant slings Lex onto his back.  She grabs her hands around his neck and digs her feet into his sides.  Grant begins to climb over the downed fence and into the embankment - it's a huge drop! Grant grabs a broken cable and lowers himself and Lex over the side of the embankment.

Grant, with Lex on his back, slides down the cable, rappelling down the embankment.  ABOVE, the car looms over them, rocking on the edge.  Lex looks up and grabs Grant so tightly, she chokes him, unknowingly. Grant, eyes bulging, sees the danger from above.  He pushes off the wall and swings them toward the next hanging cable.  He reaches out and - - GRABS THE NEXT CABLE just as - - the T-Rex BELLOWS and lowers her head, and gives a final shove.  Timmy and the cruiser SAIL INTO SPACE.  Timmy SCREAMS! Grant and Lex swing out of the way as the cruiser sails past them.  Lex SCREAMS, squeezing Grant's neck even tighter!   They watch helplessly as the cruiser BOUNCES off the wall and CRASH-LANDS into the top of a tree at the base of the wall. Grant and Lex stare down at the wreck in the tree.  Timmy can't be seen.

Behind them the duckbills charge with surprising speed.  Their enormous bodies charge in a tight group, kicking up dirt, rocks, whole trees as they thunder along. CLOSE ON - a charging duckbill as he HONKS, eyes wild with fear. A horrible ROAR of the T-Rex sends a duckbill infant squealing and struggling to stay out from underfoot. CLOSE ON - A huge adult foot almost tramples the infant. Frightened and confused the infant scampers even deeper into the maelstrom.  The frenzied herd raises a great cloud of yellow dust. GRANT AND LEX AND TIMMY run wildly.  The stampede is very close behind Grant and the kid's faces are covered with sweat and dust. Another deafening ROAR of the T-Rex. Grant leads them toward a rocky outcrop with a stand of big conifers. The animals continue to close. CLOSE ON - the running feet of the stampeding animals.  The ground VIBRATES every time it is struck by the huge feet. GRANT AND THE KIDS scramble onto the rocks.  They frantically tuck in between big boulders as the the herd reaches them.  Lex shields her dusty face with her hands as she wedges deeper between the rocks.  Grant pushes her down deeper and looks up from between the rocks. GRANT'S POV - the immense legs of the first hadrosaur to pass.  Another slams its big tail against the rocks, leaving a splash of hot blood. Stampeding legs send clods of dirt fl ying in the air.  Above, even the birds are running.  Disoriented, they fly frantically along. GRANT AND THE KIDS are enveloped in dust.  Just shadows of huge bodies with giant limbs.  BELLOWS of pain as animals wheel and circle. A boulder is dislodged and it rolls toward Timmy.  He dives out of his rocky hiding place.  The boulder continues on toward Grant and Lex. They dive after Timmy.  The group buries itself anew in a group of thick roots tangled amidst smaller rocks.  The boulder continues on, SMASHING the rocky enclave they have just left. Grant and the kids huddle and watch the last under-bellies oscillate above them.  The stampede goes past.  They lie there, unable to move. They watch the herd trample on. CLOSE ON - The Rex's foot as it crushes a motion sensor. Lex SCREAMS.  Grant and Timmy cover her mouth. The T-Rex hunts down the herd.  He targets his prey.  A young hadrosaur. As the hadrosaur gallops into the shadowy treeline, the Rex lunges fiercely.  The Rex and its victim are enveloped in dust. Grant holds Lex close.

The kids burrow into the rib cage of the Rex.  They break off floating rubs and hurl them back at the raptor.  The raptor is undeterred, closing the gap on the kids. The kids are stuck at the end of the rib cage - it's closed off by the skeleton and they can't break through.  They're imprisoned.  The raptor is pushing through the rib cage, bones crackling as it goes. Grant leaps up the scaffolding, grabs a beam, swings his weight onto it, and slams it into the T-Rex's neck.  The neck shatters and the massive head of the T-Rex drops free. It falls directly onto the last raptor, squashing him flat.  Dead.",
