Hobbes is wearing overlarge blue jeans and a red plaid shirt; Annabelle is in a private girls' school outfit -- white blouse, dark blue tie, blue knee socks, pleated gray skirt. Annabelle fights back fiercely; Hobbes has tears in his eyes. The struggle takes them all over her apartment, which, although sparsely furnished, presents enough objects in their way to cause a lot of crashing around. At one point Annabelle breaks loose and Hobbes has to chase her. Annabelle slips and Hobbes manages to pin her to the ground, where he has the advantage of leverage. He strangles her quickly and with tremendous, crazy energy. Blood oozes from her mouth. Hobbes places his hand over her mouth as though trying to prevent her from speaking, or to prevent something from leaving her body. He reaches over to his leather doctor's bag, which has spilled some of its contents on to the floor, finds a surgical clamp, and clamps Annabelle's lips together. He then picks up her body, carries it over to the dining-room table and sweeps the few cups and bottles on it off on to the floor. He then places her body with great tenderness on the table and begins to undress it.",

Hobbes takes a scalpel from the top of the radiator where he has laid out his surgical instruments. He feels Annabelle's stomach until he has found what he wants, then cuts her open with one smooth, confident stroke of the scalpel. He then quickly douses the inside of her abdomen with some clear fluid in a squeeze bottle, lights a wooden match, and drops it into her abdominal cavity. The corpse bursts into flame. Hobbes steps back to watch. Tears spring into his eyes. He picks up another scalpel and perfunctorily sticks it into his neck. Blood spurts into his mask and soaks through to the other side. Hobbes sinks to his knees before the blazing corpse and struggles to draw the scalpel through the tendons of his neck.",

ROLLO LINSKY'S LABORATORY -- AFTERNOON Next to a shallow porcelain tray full of immense and grotesque marine worm specimens lies a large parcel wrapped in brown paper. Rollo's plump fingers eagerly open the package to reveal a large variety of delicatessen sandwiches and accessories. Rollo offers some to St. Luc while stuffing one in his own mouth. There are Cokes and old coffees everywhere, plus mustard, relish, and ketchup dispensers of all kinds. Rollo and St. Luc sit around Rollo's desk, a very sleek metal affair. Rollo's lab itself is a combination of modern office and biology room in a museum of natural history. Specimens of all kinds, in bottles and cases, mounted on glass and wood, floating in preservative baths, are everywhere. There are also a few cages of living insects, moldy aquaria and lab cultures in various stages of neglect. There are also clippings from magazines and newspapers sporting furious underlinings and circlings in red ink which are stuck to walls, doors, bookshelves. Despite the potential for chaos, however, there is an underlying order which reflects Rollo's own real discipline, which is not always immediately apparent. And the microscopes and glass slides, the stainless-steel gynecological table complete with stirrups, metal drug and instrument cabinet, etc., are spotless and in good shape. Rollo is rotund, soft-faced, and a manic-depressive. In his manic phase he is a joker and an elbow-nudger, and his general style, even when discussing medical matters in medical jargon, is broad North-American Jewish. In his depressive phase, he becomes a sullen kid who has an oddly sinister aspect to his character. Rollo detaches himself from his baby beef in order to comment on the food that, not so secretly, he loves best of all.",

After a moment he straightens up and begins to press around the area of his navel, obviously looking for lumps which it seems -- from his expression -- he has already found and is overly familiar with. The water-pick continues to rattle around in the sink. Janine pokes her head around the corner to investigate.

Next to her sits Betts, who is in her early forties, attractive in a tough kind of way, and wears her hair short for efficiency's sake. In her relationship with Janine she plays the role of tough, worldly older sister. She has the poise and confidence of a woman who has created her own success and position in life, a marked contrast to the neurotic vivacity of Janine, who is ten years her junior and has never known independence. They are both watched by the only other occupant of the sauna, Benda Sviben, now a full-fledged resident of Starliner Towers. She is huddled in a corner, very shy and looking particularly thin, mousy, and ineffectual in the presence of the other two full-bodied women. Betts is in the middle of giving Janine advice about Tudor's disease.",

He loosens his tie and makes himself a drink, then sits down on the sofa and switches on the TV set. After only a short moment of relative calm, Tudor suddenly contracts into the fetal position, spilling his drink on to the floor. He rolls on to the floor, eyes staring out of his head, mouth opening and closing like that of a fish out of water, tendons in his neck bulging with tension. He soon manages to struggle to his feet, the primary spasm of pain apparently over. He keeps both hands clamped over his mouth as though in a vain attempt to forestall a bout of vomiting and stumbles into the bathroom. Once in the bathroom, Tudor throws himself over the side of the bathtub, knees on the bath mat, head well down into the tub itself. He gags and vomits into the tub and collapses, exhausted, on the floor, mouth bloody. In the tub, a trail of blood-streaked slime leads into the drain.",

The presence of the wounded parasite is indicated only by the glistening slime trail which streaks the section of wall immediately below the window. The hand of an old woman, puckered and wrinkled from many hours submerged in hot soapy water, reaches up, and yanks the bar of soap out of the jaws of the window. The window swing shut. The woman's hand slides the bolt home, locking the window from the inside. The old woman is short, dumpy, puffy-faced, in her late sixties. Her hair is carelessly tied in a bun on top of her head. She sniffles, shakes her head, turns away from the window, and walks across the room to the long bank of washers and dryers. As she walks she has to thread her way among the dozen or so shopping bags full of dirty laundry -- against apartment regulations, she takes in outsiders' laundry -- which she has brought down the elevator with her. She flips open the top of the first washer and begins to dig clothes out of the nearest shopping bag. From above and behind the washer, we watch her fill the machine and reach into the front of her dress, which is black and frayed. After feeling around for a few seconds, she pulls out a plastic bag filled with white granulated detergent. She dumps some of this into the washer, finds the appropriate coins in the pocket of her dress, and starts the machine. She watches it for a second to make sure it's working properly, then puts the plastic bag back where she found it. She picks up the bag she has almost emptied and shuffles in her ragged slippers to the next washer. She stops in front of it and puts down the bag. The old woman notices a slimy streak near the open hole of the washer. She grimaces, grabs a sock from the bag and cleans off the top of the washer with it. She tosses the sock into the washer and leans over the hole, trying to see inside. The parasite which has been lurking in the washer suddenly springs from the opening on to the old woman's face, suckering on to her flesh with its stubby tentacles. She shrieks and grabs at the creature with both hands, trying to pull it off. She stumbles back from the washer and begins to trip over various shopping bags. Finally she goes down amidst her laundry, thrashing and spilling clothes out everywhere.",

I'm Hobbes's partner, right? (laughs sardonically) Anyway, I've been going through his papers, and what they add up to is this: Hobbes was shafting us all, me, the university, the foundations and the councils, the private labs, everybody.

She takes a sip, then goes into the bathroom and bends over the bathtub, having balanced her drink on the edge of the tub. From inside the drain of the tub we see Betts place the plug in the plughole. Betts turns on the water, adjusting the proportion of hot to cold until she gets it exactly the way she wants it, then gets undressed. She wraps a thick and colorful towel around her and goes out to the living room with her drink in hand. In the living room, she arranges her photos in a new order, props them up against the sofa, changes them around again. Back in the bathroom, Betts checks the temperature of the water by swishing her hand around in it. The water drums heavily on the floor of the tub. Betts puts her drink on the edge of the tub and turns the water off. She now drops her towel on to the bathmat and steps into the tub. She reaches over the edge of the tub to straighten her sandals on the bathmat, then picks up her drink and stretches back. She takes a big slug of her drink. Her toes curl in pleasure. The drain plug begins to jerk and twitch, as though something were trying to push it out from inside the drain. Betts sinks down in the water until her hair, short as it is, begins to float a bit. The drain plug begins to jerk more and more violently until it is pushed right out of its plug hole. The water begins to run out of the drain, but only in a slight trickle -- the drain pipe is blocked by a soft, spongy body. Betts rolls her head back and forth across the back of the tub, smiling, relaxed, enjoying the sensation. One of the parasite's stubby tentacles slowly appears, probing out of the drain hole. Then another appears, then another. Betts puts down her drink on the tub's edge and reaches for the soap and washcloth. Her eyes are half-closed and a smile still flickers about her lips. The sound of water suddenly rushing out of the drain in volume rouses Betts out of her reverie. She sits up and looks down toward the plug end of the tub. The parasite is crawling toward her up the middle of the tub, almost touching her legs, which are pressed together against one side of the tub. The water is becoming pink with the blood that diffuses through it. Betts' mouth opens slowly and her eyes are wide. Her reactions are obviously being confused by the drinks she has recently had. Under the water, now very shallow, the parasite's tentacles touch Betts's thighs. Betts tries to scream but can't. The parasite suckers its way between Betts' thighs. She screams a silent scream in the tub, her mouth wide open, her head rolling from side to side. The only sounds are the thrashing of her legs in the water and the gurgle of the drain. With a spasm that shakes her whole body, Betts throws her arms wide and knocks her glass off the edge of the tub and on to the tiles of the bathroom floor. The glass shatters. After a moment or two of further silent struggle, Betts arches her back, then falls into a semi-conscious stupor, slumping motionless in the tub.",

Between his hands, in the area around the navel, three lumps shift beneath the skin, changing positions and pulsing rhythmically. As they move, Tudor makes little delirious crooning sounds, a parody of a lullaby. In the living room, Janine sits on the couch agitatedly flipping through her Vogue, now wearing large, fashionable glasses with thick, tinted prescription lenses.

Kresimir throws himself at her legs, managing to grab one of her feet. She doesn't fall, but holds on to a cabinet and tries to pull free. Kresimir begins to climb up her body. Forsythe, terrified and gasping for breath, plunges the long, curved prongs of the carving fork into Kresimir's shoulder. He screams with pain and loosens his grip on Forsythe long enough for her to pull away, leaving her apron and part of her dress in Kresimir's hands. She runs for the door and is gone. Kresimir, still on his knees, holds the apron and the piece of dress to his face, breathing in Forsythe's fragrance.

The crunch and snap of her bare feet on the broken glass are heightened abnormally by the tiled echo chamber of the bathroom. The steps Betts takes toward the medicine cabinet leave bloody prints on the floor.

MAIN DOORS -- NIGHT The doorman sits beside the intercom board reading another Harlequin Nurse Romance when he happens to glance up and notice the elevator flashers which indicate a stuck elevator. He sighs, shakes his head -- always something going wrong -- stuffs the pocketbook into his jacket, and gets up, taking out a huge ring of keys from his pocket as he does so. He walks over to the metal control panel sunk into the wall between the elevators and opens it with one of the keys on the ring. Then, checking to make sure which elevator is the stuck one, he plays with a switch which manually overrides the floor selector and brings the elevator down. The doorman watches as the numbers show that the elevator is finally coming down. He stands by, waiting to see who or what has caused the elevator to stay at one floor for so long, jingling his keys, trying to look stern and authoritarian. The doors spring open. Kurt stands at the back of the elevator, one arm around the young girl, who hugs him tightly. The girl is finishing the last bit of one of the crepes, sucking her fingers deliciously. The mother sits slumped in the opposite corner, her coat open, her dress torn, bruises on her face. She struggles to her feet. Kurt and the girl are ignoring her. The doorman is nonplussed. He hesitates, then makes a move toward the elevator, intending to help the woman to her feet.",

For the moment, his face is expressionless, but his neck is swollen just under the jaw. Janine sighs deeply, trying not to panic. Her eyes narrow suddenly -- she hasn't got her lenses in and her gaze is myopic -- as she notices something odd. There is a bit of black something, a thread, in the corner of Tudor's mouth. Janine moves closer to it. The black thing, like the tip of an insect's leg, twitches. Janine reaches out to brush the thing off Tudor's lip. As her fingers brush by, the leg twitches back inside Tudor's mouth. Janine jerks back in horror, her hands, balled into fists, cover her own mouth as though to protect it from whatever occupies Tudor's mouth. Gradually the thread reappears. Tudor's lips part slightly to allow the emergence of the dark, viscous tentacle to which the thread -- a hook used to hang on inside the body -- is attached. The tentacle of the blood parasite probes its way from between Tudor's lips. Janine is paralyzed with horror. The tentacle is now touching Tudor's chin, his cheek, the tip of his nose. Janine's fists tighten even more. A glassy snap breaks the silence. Janine lowers her hands dumbly and opens them. In the right one, the one that held the contact lenses, are incised two bloody circles where her fingers pressed the lenses into her flesh until they snapped. The segmented lens fragments glint in the tiny pools of blood. She tries to control the hysteria welling up inside her. She eases herself carefully over the side of the bed as the first stubby tentacle is joined by another and another. She moves a fraction of an inch at a time, almost hypnotized by the movement of the tentacles. The hooks of the tentacles are now set into Tudor's chin and cheeks, and the tentacles draw taut as something attempts to draw itself out of his body. His throat bulges, his cheeks swell as the tentacles contract. His lips are gradually forced apart as the quivering, moist shape emerges. His mouth is opened to jaw-breaking width as the creature slowly exposes itself to the dim light of the bedroom. Janine's eyes are wide with terror. She utters a gurgling cry and runs, stumbling, from the bedroom. She dashes through the living room and reaches the door to the hallway, whimpering in terror as she fumbles at the lock and the doorknob, finally managing to swing the door open.",

Finally his flashlight beam reveals the tattered corpse of Spergazzi's parasite. Deftly manipulating the hook on the poker's tip, St. Luc manages to pull the parasite out into the light. Garbage comes rattling down the chute. When St. Luc flashes his light into the oven, we see that the garbage consists of Betts' French food, half-eaten, silver servers and all, the snails being especially prominent. Insane giggles echo down the chute, followed by the slam of the chute door somewhere several floors above. St. Luc holds the thing up to the naked light bulb above the incinerator. The light seems to go right through the parasite, illuminating the twisted vascular system, reproductive organs, etc. As St. Luc examines the creature, which is still impaled on the hook of the poker, the door to the incinerator room opens behind him. A large, hairy, muscular man enters the room and approaches the oblivious St. Luc. The man slips his arms up under St. Luc's arms and kisses him passionately on the neck. As soon as St. Luc realizes what's happening, he smashes the man in the chest with his elbow and pulls free. The man grabs St. Luc again, trying to kiss him on the mouth. They struggle. St. Luc is thrown to the concrete floor. The man tries to pin him down. St. Luc, on the verge of being overpowered, smashes the man in the chest with the poker, parasite still hooked into its tip. The man stands up unsteadily. St. Luc cracks him on the ankle with the poker and he comes crashing down. The parasite corpse is flung across the room, where it smacks wetly into the wall and slides to the floor. St. Luc leaps to his feet and begins kicking the man in the head. After a furious moment or two, he suddenly stops, drops the poker, and stares at the body in horrified disbelief. St. Luc slowly backs away from the man's body, which is very still and quietly oozes blood on to the damp concrete floor. He bumps into the edge of the door left open by the man. The collision seems to startle him out of his daze somewhat, and he turns, himself scratched and bleeding, and staggers up the basement steps.",

The doorman is still on top of Forsythe in the front seat of the car. St. Luc pulls the doorman's gun out of its holster and begins smashing away at the doorman with it. The doorman pounds St. Luc in the temple with his fist and lifts himself partially off Forsythe, half turning toward St. Luc, who is staggered by the blow. The doorman's face is covered with blood and drool. Repulsed and terrified, St. Luc fires the gun into the doorman's upper body three times, heedless of the possibility that he might hit Forsythe. The doorman slumps over Forsythe. St. Luc grips the gun and staggers over to the car. He pulls the doorman off Forsythe, who is completely soaked with blood. She has obviously had an externally rough time, but there is nothing to suggest that she has been infected by the doorman. St. Luc shoves her over into the passenger's seat, where she slumps, dazed. He doesn't have to start the car -- it's never been turned off. He slams the shift lever into reverse and backs up, peeling rubber, to the base of the ramp. He puts it into first and begins to accelerate, foot to the floor, toward the garage door. Another car full of residents suddenly careens in front of the door and screeches to a halt, blocking St. Luc, who in swerving to avoid them smashes his fender into a concrete post. He picks up the gun from the console between the seats and, opening the car door, empties the gun at the residents, who are emerging from their car. One of the residents falls back into the car, blocking the other two.

They clamber on to him and fasten on to his face, suckering on to his ears, his throat, forehead, eyelids. One of them begins to ooze corrosive fluid on to his face. Rollo screams in pain. He manages to roll to his feet. He staggers out of the darkness of the bedroom into the living room, one arm extended, groping like a blind man, the three parasites still locked on to his face. They try to pull his lips apart, but he keeps his teeth firmly clenched to keep them from forcing their way into the depths of his body. He takes a few unbalanced steps toward the kitchen. With a sudden spasm of pain, he hurls himself sideways into the kitchen and almost falls again, grabbing at the last moment on to the sink. His hands touch a large pair of pliers, a screwdriver, and a hammer on the counter by the sink, left there by Tudor weeks ago. Rollo seizes the pliers and begins to pull the parasites from his face with their steel jaws. The parasites, swollen with Tudor's blood, burst and spurt as the pliers tear them apart. In the bedroom, Tudor's eyes snap open. His head rises from the pillow. He swings his legs over the side of the bed and, ashen and gaunt, shakes his head slowly as though waking from a dream.

Tudor falls, hitting his head on various chairs and protruding corners as he goes down, the chunk of parasite still in his mouth as he finally comes to rest, twitching, on the floor. Rollo drops the pliers on the floor. He stares at Tudor in shock. His face is reflected in a copper frying pan hanging over the stove. Noticing the reflection, Rollo leans over to get close to his own horrible image. He gingerly touches his face, inspecting the damage, shivering and moaning. Still shaking, he turns to leave. Without warning, Tudor leaps up at Rollo with insane energy and bowls him over, pliers in hand. Sitting on Rollo's chest, Tudor smashes away at Rollo's face and head with the pliers, the piece of dead parasite in his mouth dropping on to Rollo's face as he drools.",

St. Luc hesitates only for an instant, then rips a strip from her blouse, balls it up, and shoves it into her mouth. Holding her while she struggles to remove it, he rips off a second strip and ties it around her head to keep the gag in. St. Luc rises, throws Forsythe over his shoulder and begins to step toward the door of the gym. Dangling over St. Luc's shoulder, Forsythe struggles, moans, and howls as best she can. St. Luc manages to pin her hands to her sides so that she can't pull the gag out. Before St. Luc reaches the door, a handsome middle-aged woman peeks in around the corner.",

He has a very thick accent, but I can understand him perfectly. He tells me that even old flesh is erotic flesh, that disease is the love of two alien kinds of creatures for each other, that dying is an act of eroticism, that even chemicals combine out of sexual frenzy and longing. That breathing is sexual, that talking is sexual, that just to physically exist is sexual... And I believe him, and we make love beautifully...",

St. Luc decides to attempt to shoulder his way up the stairs, certain that Rollo and the police must be at the main doors. As he hits the residents on the stairs, they try to kiss him, caress him, pull his clothes off. They finally manage to drag Forsythe from his shoulders, almost unbalancing him as they do so.
