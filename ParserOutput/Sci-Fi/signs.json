Morgan Hess is seated under the jungle gym with Houdini on his lap.  Morgan is petting Houdini's fur gently.  Bo is on top of the jungle gym curled up in a ball. As Graham and Officer Paski get closer, they see Morgan is crying. Then they see the dog is laying on it side and has a BARBECUE FORK DEEP IN ITS NECK. Beat. They stare at Morgan as he slowly pulls an inhaler from his pocket and brings it to his mouth.  He inhales the asthma spray.  Beat.  He lowers the inhaler so he can speak.",

The children don't notice his presence.  They're splashing each other at the sink as they clean the dinner dishes. Graham looks through the kitchen doorway to the family room. He sees Merrill there. Merrill's hands are in his pockets as he stares at the WOODEN BASEBALL BAT mounted above the fireplace.  Merrill doesn't notice him either. Graham takes two steps to the kitchen table and slowly takes a seat.  His breathing is a slow controlled pant.  He runs one shaky hand through his hair as he gathers himself and thinks.  His kind eyes stare down at the ground as he slows his mind.  Beat. Merrill is the first to notice him.  He moves from where the baseball bat is hung, into the kitchen.  As he passes the children at the sink, he turns off the faucet. The children stop playing and look up to Merrill.  They follow his stare to the kitchen table. Beat.  Graham looks up at them.",
