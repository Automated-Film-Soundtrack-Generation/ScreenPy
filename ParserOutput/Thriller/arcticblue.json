We're in central Alaska, the Big Lonely, just north of the Arctic Circle. A thick forest follows the contours of mountain foothills like a deep-pile carpet.  Up at treeline the forest thins to tundra, a grassy scruff turning red and yellow with the coming of autumn. On the horizon, the hills rise to meet the Endicott Mountains, a great fortress wall of granite so sharp and jagged that snow cannot stick to its face.  This is how all North America once looked -- raw, indomitable. Then, abruptly coming into the SCENE is a colossal etching across the landscape too deliberate to be of natural origin. Bisecting this country like a metallic ribbon -- or a scar, depending on your point of view -- is the 800-mile-long Trans-Alaskan Pipeline. Even the immensity of the pipeline is rendered insignificant by the vastness of the land.  It goes on, and on, and on... DISSOLVE TO: A lone MAN walks along the Haul Road, a one-lane gravel trail running parallel to the pipeline.  The weather turns sour -- rough wind and stinging snow cut across the man's path. DISSOLVE TO: The man is ERIC DESMOND, twenty-four, clean-shaven, determined.  He's clearly out of place here, dressed in a business suit and a light, camel-hair topcoat. Eric is trying to follow some footprints in the snow -- a predator's tracks, those of a wolf or coyote.  But the footprints ahead have faded, covered by the snow and wind. DISSOLVE TO: The weather becomes more oppressive.  Heavy snow, gale winds and sub-zero temperatures make his progress tortuous.  Eric strives stubbornly forward. (CONTINUED) 1",

A mobile arctic dwelling sits on a rise next to the Haul Road.  It's a double-unit weathertight cocoon of fiberglass and aluminum, pulled by a diesel rig on oversized tires. The front module is 12 by 24, the rear 12 by 18. An extended-cab pickup pulls up and Sam Wilder gets out. The gravel-and-dirt Haul Road, paralleling the pipeline for 400 miles, is closed to the public.  An arriving vehicle, therefore, is news.  The front door of the dwelling opens. Eric and Anne Marie come outside, delighted to see Wilder. (CONTINUED) 26   CONTINUED:",

All are of man-made objects whose presence is juxtaposed with the natural surroundings. Relieved he's home in one piece, Anne Marie meets Eric at the door and kisses him.  Carrying a brown-paper-wrapped package, Eric follows her into the kitchen, where she's preparing dinner.",

CACHE, ALASKA - (MOVING SHOT) - NIGHT Viking Bob approaches in his station wagon on a narrow dirt road.  The huge night sky all but smothers the weak light from the town up ahead. Cache seems a mistake -- a jumble of unpainted buildings in the middle of a big nothing, twenty miles north of the Arctic Circle.  Still, it's more animated than Devil's Cauldron.  There are a hundred permanent residents, several taverns and a three-store, fly-in shopping center. (CONTINUED) 54   CONTINUED: Even though it's the middle of the night, people roam the streets, drinking and socializing.  With only a couple feet of snow on the ground, this is still summertime.  Under storefront awnings, drunken INDIANS sleep on the concrete. Viking Bob cruises the main drag, looking for the other trappers.  He spots their jeep in front of a dangerous-looking saloon called the \"Bear Sign Inn.\" ANGLE WITH VIKING BOB as he parks and gets out of his station wagon.  He hears a familiar VOICE around the side of the building.",

PUMPING STATION Mitchell runs out in front of them and BLASTS the front of the Scout with his .45 Peacemaker.  Steam HISSES out of the radiator.  Eric floors it and races past Mitchell, almost hitting him. (CONTINUED) 66   CONTINUED: Mitchell and LeMalle SHOOT at the retreating vehicle.  One of the Scout's back tires gets blown out. 67   INT.  SCOUT - (MOVING SHOT) Eric slows, shifts into four-wheel drive and continues, driving on the rim. 68   EXT.  PUMPING STATION Chewing an unlit cheroot, Viking Bob pulls up next to Mitchell and LeMalle in the trappers' jeep.  They pile in. 69   EXT.  HAUL ROAD Eric backtracks as fast as possible in the crippled vehicle. 70   INT.  TRAPPERS' JEEP - THROUGH WINDSHIELD - (MOVING SHOT) As the Scout heads for the Feldspar Creek bridge, it disappears from sight over a hill. 71   EXT.  HAUL ROAD & FELDSPAR CREEK Viking Bob zooms over Feldspar Creek.  They come over the rise, but the Scout still can't be seen ahead of them. REVERSE ANGLE The Scout sits idling in a depression near the creek bed, below the Haul Road.  Above, the trappers speed past without noticing. After giving the trappers time to get around the next bend, Eric drives the Scout up the embankment and crosses back over the bridge. 72   INT.  SCOUT Eric stops the vehicle.  He grabs a five-gallon gas can and a piece of cloth from the back. 73   EXT.  HAUL ROAD & FELDSPAR CREEK The prefab bridge is the transportable type used by the Army Corps of Engineers, left over from the building of the pipeline.  Eric stuffs the gas can between the abutment and the honeycombed underside of the bridge.  He puts the rag inside the spout of the can, lights it with a match and runs like hell back to the Scout. 74   EXT.  HAUL ROAD The trappers realize their quarry is missing.  Viking Bob slams on the brakes and looks around. 75   INT.  SCOUT - (MOVING SHOT) Eric speeds away.",

They turn around and head toward it. 78   EXT.  PUMPING STATION - HANGAR Eric parks the Scout sideways to block the way to the airstrip. With the magnum at the ready, Eric cuts Corbett's handcuffs loose from the seat and hurries him toward the hangar. The leeward side of the structure is a huge metal door on rollers.  Eric unlocks it and rolls it back.  Inside is a Cessna 182, dusted with snow and ice blown through the cracks by crosswinds.  Eric brushes the windshield with his sleeve. 79   EXT.  HAUL ROAD & FELDSPAR CREEK The trappers pull up and find the far side of the bridge burning and disconnected from the creek bank. 80   INT.  HANGAR - CESSNA Eric helps Corbett into the cockpit, then secures his handcuffs to the frame of the seat with more nylon rope. 81   EXT.  HAUL ROAD & FELDSPAR CREEK Viking Bob assesses the damage to the bridge.  Loose from the abutments, it wobbles like a diving board.  Below, the water is too deep and fast-moving to be traversable. 82   INT.  HANGAR - CESSNA Eric tries to turn the ENGINE over.  The starter is sluggish from cold and lack of use. 83   EXT.

Eric pushes the Cessna's nose down.  The plateau comes up fast. The plane drops lower and lower, pitching and yawing in the wind. It CRASH LANDS, its metal underbelly SCREECHING as it hits the jagged granite under the snow.  It stops suddenly, flipping tail over nose. 93   INT.  CESSNA It rests upside down in the snow.  The men are dazed. Behind Eric, one of the extra fuel cans, now hanging upside down, leaks gas.  In front of him, the engine is ON FIRE. Eric undoes his seat belt and rights himself, but his leg gets caught in the tangled belt.  He pulls out a Swiss Army knife and cuts the rope binding Corbett's handcuffs to the seat.  Corbett pushes the passenger door open.  Panicking, Eric tries to pull loose of his seat belt, painfully wrenching his ankle. 94   EXT.  CESSNA Corbett rolls out into the snow.  With no time to grab his supplies, Eric clambers from the wreckage.  He and Corbett crawl/roll down the incline of the plateau, away from the plane. A moment later the leaking gas reaches the burning engine and the Cessna EXPLODES. WIDER Eric tries to stand.  He cries out and falls into the powdery snow, clutching at his ankle. (CONTINUED) 94   CONTINUED: Corbett realizes Eric is at a disadvantage.  But before he can bolt, Eric grabs for the .357 magnum under his coat.  He lies on the snow, gasping, pointing the gun at Corbett's midsection.",

They wouldn't be farther from the rest of humanity on another planet.  Smelling fear on Eric, Corbett enjoys the view.  And waits. 95   EXT.

Squinting in the glare of the snow, Eric and Corbett trek through the grandiose Gates of the Arctic area.  The smoldering plane wreckage is a hard-won, snow-covered mile behind them. Intricate patterns of fragmented rock, strips of scruffy tundra and bedrock outcrops produce lonely, foreboding mosaics upon the landscape.  The air is still.  The silence is itself a disconcerting presence.  Ten miles ahead and two thousand feet lower, the forest begins.

ANGLE - GRANITE SHEER Eric and Corbett are tied, belt to belt, with the nylon rope.  Corbett inches down first, feet spread for maximum footing, gloveless hands grasping at anything. Eric mimics Corbett's moves and follows the same path. Unable to grasp the rocks effectively, he stops and takes his gloves off.  Continuing, he winces -- the rock is cold and sharp.  His hands are soon numb and bloody.  Even in the dry, below-freezing air, Eric is sweating. He looks down and hangs on more tightly.  Sliding to level ground two hundred feet below would pummel him to hamburger. Corbett pauses and rests his cheek against the rocks.  Eric is right above him. (CONTINUED) 106  CONTINUED: Suddenly, Corbett's foot slips.  His right hand instinctively goes for a hold.  The dangling handcuffs snare on a protuberance, knocking him off balance. The fulcrum of Corbett's body leans out into the empty air. Eric moves down a little, braces himself and extends his leg, giving Corbett something to grab.  Corbett takes hold of Eric's shoe and tries to teeter back against the rock wall.  Adrenaline screams through Eric's system. Corbett looks up at Eric.  A careless move will send them both tumbling.  Eric clutches harder at the rocks and waits for the worst. After a long moment, Corbett regains his balance and lets go of Eric's foot.  He continues his descent.  Eric lets out his breath and tries to swallow.  His mouth is as dry as the granite.",

Mr. Byers had a toothache and attempted to remove the tooth himself with a pair of pliers... Suddenly, a BUMP rocks the Turtle.  Someone is outside. Startled, Anne Marie turns the lights off and looks out the window. No sign of a vehicle or a person.  As she pulls on her parka, she glances at the big rifle leaning against the wall, but doesn't touch it. 115  EXT.  THE TURTLE Her visitor, whoever it is, is behind the Turtle.  Anne Marie cautiously rounds the corner and stops dead. NEW ANGLE A foraging GRIZZLY sniffs around, attracted by the smell of fresh carrion -- Wilder.  Eight feet tall and eleven-hundred pounds, it's used to having its way.  Right now, it's hungry. With a casual swipe of its paw, its massive claws puncture the Turtle's aluminum skin, popping open the door of the utility compartment.  The bear pokes its head inside, and Wilder's body slumps out into the snow.  The bear pushes at the corpse with its snout.  Salivating, it prepares to dig in. Anne Marie looks around, wondering what the hell to do nEXT. Wilder's snowmobile is a few yards behind her, parked against the side of the Turtle.  She inches toward it. Testily, the bear looks up, SNIFFING loudly. Keeping her eyes on the bear, Anne Marie feels for the snowmobile ignition keys.  They're not there.  She feels around inside the saddlebags and finds three emergency road flares. Anne Marie IGNITES the flares.  They illuminate the area with an eerie reddish glow.  She YELLS at the bear, wields the flares like Excalibur and moves forward. The bear, reluctant to leave so hearty a pre-hibernation meal, GROWLS and cocks its head back and forth to assess the threat.  As Anne Marie inches ahead, the bear stands on hind legs to its full height to meet the challenge. (CONTINUED) 115  CONTINUED: Anne Marie tosses a flare toward the bear.  It grunts when the flare hits it, and shuffles backwards.  Anne Marie throws another flare.  With a ROAR from hell, the bear charges.  Anne Marie falls back.  Still holding the last flare, she's forced into a crawl space under the Turtle. ANGLE - UNDER THE TURTLE Anne Marie tries to squeeze out the other side, but she's pinned in by the unevenness of the hard ground.  The bear swipes at her, its huge paw inches away.  Anne Marie jabs at the paw with the flare, but that only makes the bear more quarrelsome. She twists around, looking for a defense.  Above her is the cabling from the generator to the circuit box for the Turtle's electrical system.  She tugs at it, but it won't budge.  The bear SNIFFS at Anne Marie with its big wet snout.  Anne Marie notices warning a sign on a control valve: ?  DANGER!! ?  BLACK WATER ?  UNTREATED SEWAGE Grimacing, she tries to turn the valve.  After much effort, it SNAPS and opens, releasing a stream of fetid sewage. WIDER The bear gets a muzzle full of the stuff.  HOWLING unhappily, it backs away, GRUNTING and SNEEZING.  Greatly offended, its appetite gone, it lopes into the forest. Anne Marie squirms out from under the Turtle and, gagging from the horrible smell, pulls off her wet parka.",

He bolts the door and blocks the windows, opening one enough to let sound in from outside.  He extinguishes the Benman lantern and douses the fire in the heat stove so no smoke will emit from the chimney.  Anne Marie slumps into the corner next to the dumb waiter.",

Before he can say anything, Eric shoots him a cold look.  Corbett stays quiet. 169  EXT. / INT.  DEVIL'S CAULDRON - VARIOUS ANGLES - DAY A pall hangs over the town.  People know to stay inside. Time crawls by. In his house, Neff, for once, has his TV turned off.  He tries to read and listens for sounds outside. In the spa, water DRIPS somewhere.  All the stalls are empty. In his sod house, Kenai looks out his one tiny window at the curtain of snow.  Dixie comes up behind him and puts her hands on his shoulders.  He looks up at her, glum. In Wilder's empty cabin, his belongings are scattered about as if expecting his imminent return. In the rental cabin, Eric checks his watch.  10:45 AM. 170  EXT.  DEVIL'S CAULDRON - NEAR WILDER'S CABIN - DAY The sound of a MOTOR grows in volume, then abruptly ceases. The trappers' jeep APPEARS in the snowfall on the road into town.  It coasts quietly in and stops behind the cover of a woodpile across from Wilder's cabin. The trappers get out of the jeep.  LeMalle has Eric's Remington, Mitchell has his Peacemaker, and Viking Bob carries LeMalle's old carbine.  Mitchell spits.  It's so cold outside that the spittle freezes and CRACKS before it hits the ground. They fan out and approach Wilder's cabin. ANGLE WITH TRAPPERS The cabin comes more clearly into view as the trappers move closer.  There is no sign of life.  Viking Bob gestures for the others, now positioned on either side of the cabin, to crouch down for cover.",

DEVIL'S CAULDRON - ANTENNA TOWER With a camera bag slung over her shoulder, Anne Marie climbs up the metal antenna tower behind Neff's house on the edge of town. She grits her teeth and fights back a wave of vertigo. The ground disappears from sight, hidden by the snow and fog. Fifty feet up, she attaches her infrared video camera to the tower crossbars and, using a length of coaxial cable, hooks its RF output to the feedline of the community TV antenna. 182  INT.  RENTAL CABIN Eric looks at his watch.  10:55 AM. 183  EXT.  DEVIL'S CAULDRON - NEAR MAQI A CRACKING twig behind the cabins gets the trappers' attention.  Clutching his rifle, LeMalle goes to investigate. WITH LEMALLE as he probes through the snow, listening.  He reaches the edge of the woods and, finding nothing, returns to the others. NEW ANGLE Anne Marie crouches behind a tree, twenty feet behind LeMalle.  After a moment, she tiptoes back toward the rental cabin. 184  INT.  RENTAL CABIN Eric and Corbett turn as Anne Marie's camera bag suddenly drops from the dumb waiter shaft.  Anne Marie wriggles back inside.  Before Eric can say anything, she puts her fingers over his mouth.  She turns on the TV set and tunes it to channel 3. ANGLE ON TV A fuzzy IMAGE comes into view.  It's Devil's Cauldron from the vantage of Anne Marie's infrared video camera.  The falling snow shows up as a translucent yellow wash over the scene.  Buildings are distinguishable as bluish silhouettes. Heat-producing objects -- warm walls, chimney smoke, etc. -- are pink and red.  And there are three clearly-definable human figures standing near the Maqi.  The trappers. BACK TO SCENE Corbett is amazed.  Eric smiles at Anne Marie. (CONTINUED) 184  CONTINUED:",

DANCE HALL Anne Marie zips up her parka and cautiously goes outside. 197  EXT.  HOT SPRINGS SPA LeMalle follows the footprints to the door Eric left ajar. He peers inside. 198  INT.  HOT SPRINGS SPA It's tomb-quiet except for water DRIPPING and pipes CREAKING.  LeMalle looks around.  The sound of a small DING against metal above him gets his attention. He sees a fleeting shadow cut across the catwalk above him. He finds a metal ladder, slings his rifle over his shoulder and climbs up.  Hearing another SOUND on the far side of the catwalk, he hurries across, holding onto the pipes for balance. LeMalle is directly above the huge central pool.  He ducks to go under a long piece of twine running from the ceiling to a dark corner below.  Suddenly, the twine snaps tight, pulling open a heavy trap door on the ceiling.  The door swings down and knocks LeMalle off the catwalk.  With a yelp, he splashes into the water below. NEW ANGLE Hidden in the shadows, Eric drops the end of the twine and rushes toward the front door with Corbett in tow.",

He lights it, tosses it toward Mitchell and covers his eyes.  It EXPLODES with a muffled pop and a bright flash of white light. Mitchell stumbles backwards and blinks his eyes.  The flash has temporarily clouded his vision. Eric moves Corbett to another approach to the depot and waits for Mitchell to move on. 207  EXT.  REAR WALL OF AIRSTRIP DEPOT Mitchell is about to do just that when a hand on his shoulder stops him.  It's LeMalle, oblivious to the profuse bleeding from his right shoulder.

In his left hand, impossibly, he still clutches the massive Remington. He hoists it to his hip and grits his teeth as he BOLTS a round into the chamber with his injured right arm.  Bracing himself, he levels the rifle at Eric. Hearing the ACTION of the rifle, Eric turns. Corbett reaches down, grabs a rusty Eskimo spear in both his handcuffed hands, and hurls it. There is a deafening ROAR as LeMalle's rifle discharges. LeMalle flies back from the recoil -- and from the spear stuck clear through his chest. Some packing material above Eric's head smolders, ignited by the muzzle blast. NEW ANGLE There is a moment of silence.  Corbett looks at the other weapons near him, and then at Meyerling.  Threatened, Meyerling pulls out a .380 automatic.  Before Eric can do anything, Meyerling FIRES. The IMPACT of the bullet throws Corbett against some boxes. (CONTINUED) 212  CONTINUED:  (2) With a YELL, Eric jumps Meyerling and rips the gun from his grasp.  Enraged, he pummels Meyerling with it until Kenai and Neff pull them apart.
