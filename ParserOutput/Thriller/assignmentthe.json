We CUT back and forth between Ramirez and then as Ramirez strains to look harder, unbelievingly, we PUSH IN tighter on the picture from his POV and to our amazement, the man in the picture looking back up at us is Ramirez! Then suddenly the man in the picture moves and his finger comes up to his lips and he looks at us and says, \"SHHHHH.\" Just then, a street vendor in the same scene pulls out a gun and shoots Ramirez in the picture in the head. Ramirez falls and the picture goes back to a still shot of Ramirez lying face down in the black and white photo, oozing black blood onto the white sidewalk of beautiful downtown Tripoli. He looks out the window at the bluish sky as we shift focus between him and his background. He looks down at the bowl of porridge.",

Ramirez turns in a fury and starts walking away as the snowmobiles bear down from four different directions, coming straight towards Jack. Jack says absolutely nothing. Ramirez turns and sees Jack is making absolutely no attempt to toss the transmitter. Jack simply locks eyes with Ramirez. Jack is not going to budge. Ramirez turns his back and is about to continue walking away but the noise of the snowmobiles bearing on the unrelenting Jack grows louder. Ramirez can take it no more. He turns, pulls out the gun and must run right to where Jack is in order to get shots off at each snowmobile. He fires through the dummy rounds until he takes out all four snowmobiles, the last of which comes to rest only a few feet away from them both. Ramirez is exhausted. When Jack speaks it is quietly and with contempt.",

He stands outside the house looking at it like an adult who has come back to his boyhood home and finds it suddenly so small. Just then the door opens. There is Maura holding the baby and next to her, Joey. Ramirez runs toward them and they to him and we SEE them in tableaux, embracing. An idyllic family reunited.",

Frank starts to drop but before he can, Ramirez grabs his ears and brings his head down into his own swiftly rising knee. The result is devastating and Frank's nose is now all across his face. Blood is everywhere and Ramirez does it again. Now the object is Frank's teeth, so that when his head comes off of Ramirez's knee, his mouth is a mass of blood as well. In slow motion, Ramirez turns and sees his son who stares in horror at what his father has just done. At the same time, maura is up and grabbing onto Ramirez. Ramirez however is not done. Frank is completely defenseless now and Ramirez leans him back across his knee, pulls him by the hair exposing his throat like that of a sacrificial lamb about to be slaughtered. This time instead of a knife, it will be a karate chop from Ramirez which will crush Frank's windpipe and kill him. But before he can deliver the blow, Maura grabs his arm. He turns to her, almost about to hit her or throw her off and the two of them are face to face as Ramirez looks from her to his son and realizes how deep into the abyss he has plunged.",
