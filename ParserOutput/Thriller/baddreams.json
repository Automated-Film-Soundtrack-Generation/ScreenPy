Not violent, but slow, passionate, dreamlike. They are completely enjoying each other. The satisfaction seems spiritual. They stare into each other's eyes the entire time. They are lost. Gradually Victor's rhythm builds. As his momentum increases, as the ecstasy nears, Cynthia accelerates too. Heaving, gasping, they are approaching a beautiful climax. But just when it seems Victor is on the verge, the very threshold, he stops and JUMPS violently out of bed.",
