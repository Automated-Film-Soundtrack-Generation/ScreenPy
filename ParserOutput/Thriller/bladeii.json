Some kind of noodle factory filled with steam and equipment and YAMMERING FOREIGNERS and -- -- here comes Blade, hot on the vampires' heels, shouldering workers aside and -- EXT. NOODLE FACTORY - NIGHT -- Rush and the remaining vamps spill out onto the street where a number of motorcycles are waiting for them -- two BMW R1200 motorbikes and a tricked-out Panhead Harley chopper with ape-hanger handlebars. Rush and Segura leap atop their BMWs.  Jigsaw rolls into a puddle of water, dousing himself, then jumps onto his chopper.  As the vamps peel out -- BLADE Bursts from the factory.  Segura revs his BMW, trying to run him down.  At the last second, Blade pivots aside like a matador.  Segura circles around for another try. Blade leaps, somersaulting through the air, then lands on the back of the bike behind Segura.  SHINGGG!  Blade pulls a retractable garrotte wire from the sleeve of his jacket and wraps it around Segura's throat. With a violent twist, Blade decapitates Segura.  As the vampire's headless body turns to ash before him, Blade leans forward and takes the controls of the speeding motorcycle.",

Rounding out the bunch is CHUPA, a blunt featured Puerto Rican, and VERLAINE, a familiar-looking curvaceous beauty with bee-stung lips that exudes a predatory sexuality. (NOTE: Verlaine looks familiar because she is the twin sister of Raquel, the bodacious vamp played by Traci Lords that Blade killed in the opening scene of the first film.)",

Priest pumps his shotgun repeatedly.  Two projectiles fire out, chained together by a length of titanium cable.  The cable catches the Reaper in the mid-section, cutting it clean in half! The upper half of the Reaper falls, then rights itself, landing on its clawed hands. Impossibly, the she-Reaper keeps coming!  She skitters towards Priest on his hands like the half-man from Todd Browning's \"FREAKS\". The half-Reaper launches itself at Priest, hitting him in the chest, knocking him back to the floor.  Priest panics as he struggles with the thing, trying to fend off its claws and fangs as it locks its mouth into his arm.  He SCREAMS.",

The man is super-charged and ready for war. Blade tears into the vampires, unleashing a blizzard of martial arts moves.  He powers a right hook into the first vampire's face, then pivots, launching a devastating spinning back-fist into the face of a second.  At the same time, he rips the second guard's security belt from his waist, twirling it around nanchadku-style to blind a third guard and capture the wrist of a fourth.

Blade avoids Nomak, but third time's the charm and Nomak lands one squarely in Blade's gut. Blade falls beneath a flurry of blows, unable to defend himself any longer.  Blood stains his eyes, obscuring his vision.  He strikes out blindly, but Nomak has forced him to the ground, pinning him there.  As Blade struggles to free himself -- NOMAK lowers his head towards Blade's face.  The scar/seam in Nomak's chin splits open and Nomak's lower jaw flares apart, distending and widening to reveal the awful, glistening hell maw -- the hollow inner fangs and striated cartilage which are closing about Blade's face.  Blade twists his head violently to the right, then glimpses the broken tip of his sword resting a few feet away.  He reaches for it in desperation, plunging it up into Nomak's chest.  Nomak HOWLS. Because the hilt has been broken off, Blade is forced to grip the cutting edge of the weapon with his bare hands.  It slices into his fingers -- but Blade just grips the broken sword tighter, ignoring the pain, driving it deeper and deeper -- until, suddenly, it penetrates the cartilaginous shell around Nomak's heart and -- NOMAK (in vampire dialect) Blood brother. Nomak smiles, covering Blade's hands with his own.  He looks blade in the eye, then drives the broken sword home. Nomak's body stiffens, his eyes grow unseeing, an oddly serene look spreading across his tortured face.  A patch of",
