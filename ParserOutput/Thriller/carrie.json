Among other things, we will see: A) THE GYM  as last-minute arrangements are made  more crepe paper hung, party favors put on tables, etc.; B) CARRIE  in a town store as she shops for makeup; C) NORMA WATSON  under a hair dryer, her mouth going a mile a minute as a manicurist does her nails and looks utterly exhausted; D) TOMMY  picking out Carrie's corsage at the florist; E) CARRIE  at the sewing machine, finishing her dress (which we still don't see), a happy look on her face; F) THE GYM  as a bank of lights suddenly illuminate the mural on the stage wall; G) SUE  having dinner with her parents H) THE TWINS  in front of their dressing tables; both of them putting on enormous fake eyelashes simultaneously; I) ERNEST  the class president  making sure the microphone on the stage works; J) THE BAND  among them, The Beak, setting up; K) SANDRA STENCHFELD, practicing her fabulous twirling baton act; L) A DOOR  which opens to reveal the twins in their high heels, both of them several inches taller than their depressed-looking dates; M) GEORGE AND FRIEDA  he in his tuxedo, she in her prom dress; a flash as Freida's parents take a Polaroid of this night to remember; N) THE GYM  with the adult chaperones  teachers, administrators  standing around, looking for something to do. 83 It is now the night of the Prom  just minutes before it officially begins, we end this montage and: DISSOLVE TO: 171 INT.
