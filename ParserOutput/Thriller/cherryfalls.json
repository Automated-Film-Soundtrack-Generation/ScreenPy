HOUSE - MONTAGE THE HOUSE is under siege and Jody is trapped in it. She runs from room to room, turning the lights out but windows break wherever she goes. It's terrifying. INT.  FOYER Suddenly there is a silence. Jody stops running. She realizes that the killer must be climbing in somewhere. Jody isn't sure what to do. She hears something in the family room. INT.  FAMILY ROOM Jody enters. She sees the killer's shadow cross the window. She runs out. INT.  HALLWAY Jody creeps through the dark house, unsure where to go. INT.  DEN Jody creeps back into the den. The killer doesn't seem to be there either. The window is broken. The curtains flap in the breeze. She moves toward it, wondering whether it's safe to climb out. She looks in the mirror. In the mirror, Jody can see the killer's shoes peeking out from under the drapes. The killer's in the room. The drapes start to move. Jody turns around and swings the bat, hitting the killer squarely in the head, sending her to the ground, pulling the drapes down. INT.  HOUSE Jody tears for the front door. INT.  FRONT HALL Jody's too nervous to unlock the front door. She hears the killer coming so she tears up the stairs. INT.  STAIRCASE Jody scampers up the staircase but she's not fast enough. The killer grabs her leg through the wooden slatted banister starts pulling her off the staircase, breaking the wooden slats. Jody grabs one of the jagged slats and rams the sharp end into the killer's hand, freeing herself. INT.  STAIRS Jody charges up the stairs and into the bathroom. INT.  BATHROOM Jody closes the bathroom door and locks it. The killer starts kicking it in. INT.  BATHROOM Jody opens the small bathroom window to climb out on the roof. The door starts to splinter. Jody tries to wriggle her way out but it's tight. Behind her she hears the door splintering open. EXT.  ROOF Jody squeezes through and grabs hold of the chimney, using it to pull herself out. INT.  BATHROOM The killer's hand grabs Jody's leg just as Jody's pulling herself free. The killer closes the window on Jody's leg, trapping it inside. Out comes the razor. EXT.  ROOF Jody fights for her freedom, tugging at the chimney, kicking and screaming: All of a sudden she feels a surge of pain. She screams and kicks with all her might, freeing herself, her momentum sending her rolling down the roof. She rolls off the roof, barely grabbing hold of the gutter, hanging from it. The gutter starts to break. Above her she can hear the killer coming out onto the roof. The killer's silhouette hovers above, ready to grab her. Jody knows she has no choice. Jody lets go of the gutter. EXT. BACKYARD Jody falls twenty feet to the ground below.",

Rock n' Roll blares from all directions. Everyone's excited. CUT TO: EXT. STREET Jody rides down the street, just pedaling fast, as fast as she can. She's in her own world, very upset. A car comes toward the intersection on the other street but doesn't slow down, knowing the light is about to change. A boy in a passing car whistles at Jody, waking her out of her stupor. Jody looks up just as the light turns red. She hits her brakes and skids into the tail of the oncoming car. She glances off it and goes sliding off the road, into a few garbage cans. The car nicks another car and pulls over. Across the street, we see that the Killer's IMPERIAL is stopped at the red light. Jody gets up, shaken. He knees and elbows are badly scratched. The OWNER of the car comes running over to Jody.",

Jody gets up and starts backing away from him but he gets up quickly. He's not letting her get away. Jody bolts for the door but she doesn't have time to open it. Leonard grabs her and throws her across the room. Jody smashes into a  table. He bends down to pick her up, but she pulls a book case over on him, narrowly escaping. She runs for the back door. INT.  BACK DOOR Jody opens the back door and gets halfway out when Leonard runs up to her, pulls her away from the door, and slugs her in the face, sending her sprawling to the ground. He picks her up and punches her a second time, breaking her nose, knocking her half out. He picks her up by the waist and carries her to the basement stairs. INT.  BASEMENT STAIRS Leonard throws Jody down into the dark basement. She tumbles down the stairs, hitting her head on the cold stone floor. He comes charging down after her, closing the door behind them. CUT TO: INT.  PARTY HOUSE The CD is now skipping. Kids are in every corner, bed , and closet, making out. Every square inch of the house is being taken as the party shifts into higher gear. It's a sea of sheets and blankets rippling with bodies under them. Giggles and moans are heard every second. INT.  A CLOSET Sandy and Mark are gently kissing in the closet, still standing up. Mark studies Sandy's face for a second, then slowly lifts her dress, sliding his hand on to her thighs.",
