He knocks at a door with a window and a grating and a sign that says beware of the dog. The dog starts barking. Bill knocks again. He tries to look through the door window. The dog keeps on barking. Bill comes back the way he came toward the office. He stops in front of a window and bends to try to see something inside. He knocks on the window. He turns around, and we catch a quick glimpse of someone behind the window. Bill comes back to the parking lot toward a pickup that two men are unloading.",

They move together, and Bill tries to bring the red car as close to the curb as possible. Get the... You... Ohh! Get the fuck... The red car is so close to the curb that it snatches away the open door of a parked car, and then knocks down the shopping caddie of a woman. Fortunately, the woman is able to move away, but all her shopping items are scattered on the pavement. The two car bump again into each other and arrive into a main road. When the red car wants to hit Bill's car again, Bill stands on the brake and the red car hits a big truck carrying cars. The truck honks and start zigzagging in the traffic. The last car on the upper bridge of the truck gets loose and falls on the road. Bill barely avoids it. Another car gets loose from the truck and causes a pile-up on the road. Bill zigzag out of the pile-up, and comes to a crossing with a railway. A train is approaching. The red car is still behind Bill. Bill brakes suddenly just after he has crossed the railway, then starts moving backwards. He hits the front of the red car, and keeps on moving backwards until he brings the red car on the railway itself. The train keeps on honking to move the cars away. Hey! You wanna die ! Huh ? You wanna die ? We see the driver of the train working madly on his brake, and looking to the red car with terror in his eyes. Just before the train reaches the crossing, Bill jumps his car forward and the red car quickly moves backward. Bill stops a few feet after the crossing to get his breath back. We see the train moving behind him.",
