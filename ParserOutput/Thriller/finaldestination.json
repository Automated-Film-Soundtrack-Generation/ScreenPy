In the split-second strobe of lightning flash, the bolt abstractly appears as if it were a hand pointing directly at Alex. ALEX horrified, lurches away from the window, considering what he has seen.

ALEX studies the photograph, then notices the rose she gave him. Succumbing to guilt, feeling like the freak all teenagers believe they are, Alex sets the paper back on the desk. He grabs the Penthouse and turns, opening the desk drawer in order to return the magazine, however... A LOUD BANG turns Alex's head to the window! ALEX'S POV - WINDOW An OWL has apparently smashed into the window, awkwardly flapping its large wings, then turns its head toward Alex, large yellow eyes shining like an alien creature. WIDER Startled, Alex reflexively throws the Penthouse across the room, pages tearing as it hits the sill. The giant bird flies off. THE TABLE FAN swivels, a page catching in the whirling blades. A PIECE OF PAPER torn form the magazine flits across the room. ALEX CAMERA INCHES IN ON HIM as the piece of paper ENTERS FRAME, floating and flitting until landing on his knee. He picks it up and turns it over... ALEX'S POV - PIECE OF PAPER is torn in such a manner that the only lettlers remaining from the centerfold's caption are \"...Tod...\"",

CABIN - DAY - A SMALL TABLE A final piece of duct tape is applied to the corner of the table, dulling any sharp edges. Even though it is sunny outside, all the shades are pulled. The room sits in dark shadows broken by occasional bright shafts of light. CAMERA FOLLOWS a hand as it carefully picks up a Coleman lantern and sets it atop an empty can placed in the center and above the water line of a large metal tub; a fire protection moat. ALEX finds his way to a chair in the center of the room, away from everything except a nearby table holding a fire extinguisher and a first aid kit, both at less than arm's reach. Unshaven, a week and a half's growth, and unkept, Alex looks horrible. An anxious zombie, especially in the dim glow of the lantern. Dark circles, from lack of sleep. Thin, from lack of food. Pale, from lack of sunlight. He places workman's gloves on his hands before picking up a can of Underwood chicken spread. With some degree of difficulty, he works the gloves beneath the tab and pulls. Careful not to cut himself, he reaches out and drops the lid into a small trash can. Alex removes the gloves and, with a plastic spoon, begins to eat.
