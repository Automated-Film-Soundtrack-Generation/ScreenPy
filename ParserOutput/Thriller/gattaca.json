The Director briskly departs, Irene in tow.  At a nearby work station, a painfully thin programmer, NAPOLEON, perks up at the mention of the test. Jerome merely shrugs and pretends to reach down and scratch his ankle.  However he surreptitiously produced one of Eugene's transparent specimen bags from his sock.  An EXTREME CLOSE UP reveals the bag's contents - flakes of skin, hair follicles, eyelashes, a fingernail.  Cupping the bag in his hand to avoid detection, Jerome sprinkles the fraudulent body matter over his keyboard, desk surfaces and the floor around his work station. He opens his desk drawer and casually scatters the remainder of the bag.  Finally he inspects a comb already laced with two hair follicles.

He and Jerome exchange a nod.  When the man has exited the restroom, Jerome enters the man's vacated stall. INT.  GATTACA - TOILET STALL.  DAY. JEROME immediately feels around the back of the toilet bowl and detaches a secreted stainless steel container. With surprising swiftness and dexterity, Jerome removes an extremely fine contact lens from each eye and drops the pair into the toilet bowl.  He inserts two replacement lenses from the container and reattaches it in its hiding place. Jerome flushes the toilet and exits the stall.  He checks in the mirror that his new contact lenses are properly inserted. INT.  GATTACA - CORRIDOR.  DAY. Walking back along one of the long, glass-walled corridors, JEROME becomes aware of a peculiar noise in the complex - or to be more precise, a lack of noise.  The incessant tapping of computer keys has stilled. As Jerome gazes through the glass walled corridor, we see the reflection of his face, deep in thought. JEROME (VO) The most unremarkable of events.  Jerome Morrow, Navigator First class, is only days away from a one-year manned mission to 951 Gaspra in the Outer Asteroid Belt.  Nothing so unique in that.  Last year over one thousand citizens from every walk of life embarked on some space mission or other.  Besides, selection for Jerome was virtually guaranteed at birth.  He is blessed with all the physical and intellectual gifts required for such an arduous undertaking, a genetic quotient second to none. Jerome's gaze drifts to the sky. JEROME (VO) No, there is truly nothing remarkable about the progress of Jerome Morrow, except that I am not Jerome Morrow. EXT.  BEACH.  DUSK - THIRTY-ODD YEARS EARILER A starry sky.  The camera tilts down to find palm trees swaying against a setting sun. JEROME (VO) I was conceived in the Riviera.  Not the French Riviera. The camera tilts down further to find a Buick Riviera parked in a deserted beachfront parking lot on a polluted stretch of beach. JEROME (VO) The Detroit variety. Through the car's steamed windows we see Jerome's mother and father, MARIA and ANTONIO, early twenties, making love. JEROME (VO) They used to say that a child conceived in love, has a greater chance of happiness.  They don't say that any more. INT.  FAMILY PLANNING CLINIC.  DAY.

MARIA and ANTONIO drop off dark-haired 2-YEAR-OLD VINCENT at a Day Care Center. JEROME (VO) And my parents soon realized that wherever I went, my genetic prophecy preceded me. While HEALTHY CHILDREN play outside on tricycles, clamber over jungle-gyms and finger-paint, the PRE-SCHOOL TEACHER shows Vincent into a room where CHILDREN WITH OBVIOUS DISABILITIES sleep on mats. Maria wheels around and marches out of the center with Vincent in her arms.  Antonio follows close behind, pleading with his wife to see sense.

The child moves away and the name, \"ANTON 11\" is written beside the mark by proud father, ANTONIO. JEROME (VO) That's how my brother, Anton, came into the world - a son my father considered worthy of his name. There is little physical similarity between 11-YEAR-OLD ANTON and 13-YEAR-OLD VINCENT standing beside him, apart from their height.  In fact Vincent is mortified to see that his younger brother's mark is a fraction of an inch higher than the mark beside his own name, \"VINCENT 13\" .  Vincent runs from the room. EXT.  BEACH.  DAY. 13-YEAR-OLD VINCENT and 11-YEAR-OLD ANTON sit together on a windswept beach. Anton picks up a broken shell and deliberately slices the tip of his thumb with the sharp edge.  He hands the shell to Vincent who hesitantly follows suit. JEROME (VO) By the time we were playing at blood brothers I understood that there was something very different flowing through my veins. The two brothers press their thumbs together, merging the blood. JEROME (VO) And I'd need an awful lot more than a drop if I was going to get anywhere. EXT.  BEACH.  LATER IN THE DAY. While ANTONIO and MARIA doze under a beach umbrella, ANTON and VINCENT enter the water, diving through the waves.  From above we watch their two young bodies swimming beside each other beyond the breakers. JEROME (VO) Our favorite game was \"chicken\".  When our parents weren't watching, we used to swim outside the flags, as far out as we dared.  It was about who would get scared and turn back first. Suddenly VINCENT stops swimming, pulling up sharply in the water, exhausted and fearful.  He watches ANTON swim on into the distance. JEROME (VO) Of course, it was always me.  Anton was by far the stronger swimmer and he had no excuse to fail. INT.  SCHOOL - CLASSROOM.  DAY. A TEACHER gives a physics lesson.  The bespectacled 13-YEAR-OLD VINCENT has his arm energetically raised at each opportunity but is never called upon.  Eventually he lowers his arm in defeat.

Of course, it's illegal to discriminate - \"genoism\" it's called - but no one takes the laws seriously. As Jerome enters the office, we focus on the doorhandle he has just touched. JEROME (VO) If you refuse to disclose, they can always take a sample from a doorhandle... Vincent hesitates before shaking the PERSONNEL OFFICER's outstretched hand. JEROME (VO) ...or a handshake... We focus on Jerome's envelope attached to his application form sitting on the Manager's desk. JEROME (VO) ...even the saliva off your application form. Sitting opposite the manager, Jerome's face falls.  The manager puts a clear, plastic cup in front of Jerome. JEROME (VO) But for the most part we know who we are. And if all else fails, a legal drug test can just as easily become an illegal peek at your future in the company. Vincent saves the Manager the trouble and exits the office, leaving the cup where it sits. EXT.  BEACH.  DAY. 17-YEAR-OLD JEROME walks up the beach to find 15-YEAR-OLD ANTON sitting with the YOUNG WOMAN Vincent had previously dated. JEROME (VO) I didn't blame Anton for his free ride.  You can't blame someone for winning the lottery. The Young Woman hastily departs. LATER the two brothers face each other on the sand.  Anton is the more statuesque of the two.",

Out into the open sea, like always, knowing each stroke towards the horizon was one we had to make back to the shore.  Like always, the unspoken contest. We watch the two young men swimming stroke for stroke.  They swim far out, beyond the point.  Suddenly ANTON starts to slow, his strokes becoming labored until he becomes motionless in the water.  He begins to sink like a stone.  VINCENT, realizing Anton is no longer beside him, turns back to lend support. Vincent takes him in a lifeguard hold and begins to nurse him back to shore.  Finally the two boys are coughed up onto the shallows.  They collapse, just beyond the waterline, exhausted, gasping for air.  ANTONIO and MARIA arrive on the scene.  ANTON is the first to recover while VINCENT clutches his side, his face screwed up in pain.

He gazes at a framed family portrait - Vincent's face has been torn out of it.  He suddenly spies VINCENT exiting the front gate, carrying a suitcase.  Anton goes to shout Vincent's name but the words don't get out. EXT.  GATTACA.  DAWN. A pick-up truck, packed with a CLEANING CREW, pulls into the rear of the building.  They are no longer strictly the migrant workers we have come to expect but rather a mixture of ethnicities - all members of a genetic underclass that does not discriminate by race. As VINCENT exits the truck and turns towards the camera, we discover that he has now matured into the man we have come to know as JEROME.  The only visible differences are the glasses he wears and his hair, still naturally dark. JEROME (VO) Like many others in my situation, I moved around a lot in the next few years, getting work where I could.  I must have cleaned half the toilets in the state. We follow VINCENT through the course of a day.  Cleaning restrooms, toilets, picking up litter, sweeping, washing windows - gazing at the AEROSPACE WORKERS below.  The building is part of the Gattaca facility, located near a shuttle launch site.  Throughout the day, with the regularity of 747's, Vincent spies rocket ships in the distance, launching into the sky. Jerome's is the only head that turns and looks up.  Long after the sun has set, Vincent is still working.  Another rocket ship lights up the darkness.  Vincent gazes forlornly into the heavens. EXT. GATTACA - GLASS WALL.  DAY. VINCENT cleans a window from the outside, staring in at the arrogant GATTACA EMPLOYEES entering the security channels - a smaple taken from their fingertips.  Jerome, in a trance, constantly cleans the same spot of glass.  He fails to notice an Older Janitor, CAESAR, appear beside him.",

The SURGEON switches on a surgical saw and lines it up with handdrawn incision marks. Metal struts are ready to elongate his legs. INT.  IN-VALID HOUSING PROJECT - APARTMENT.  DAY. GERMAN wheels the dazed EUGENE into the apartment, cluttered with space paraphenalia.  One wheel of his rusting wheelchair is flimsily held on with wire.  VINCENT follows behind on crutches, both lower legs in casts and cross-braces.  Vincent signs the contract German puts in front of him. EXT.  STREET OUTSIDE A BAR.  DAY. EUGENE, glassy-eyed, strides out of a bar, past camera and into the street.  We hear a squeal of brakes and a sickening thud. INT.  HOUSING PROJECT - APARTMENT.  DAY. EUGENE awakens with a scream, bathed in sweat, arms bound to a bed - the only real piece of furniture in the room.  VINCENT, sitting on a crate beside him, soaking a towel in a bowl of water, is taken by surprise.  Eugene continues to scream and thrash, fighting against his bindings.  Vincent stuffs the towel into Eugene's mouth and holds onto his arms. JEROME (VO) I confess, at first I wondered if I had rescued a man who was already dead. INT.  HOUSING PROJECT - APARTMENT - BATHROOM.  NIGHT. VINCENT holds EUGENE's head over the toilet bowl as he vomits violently.  Eugene's paralysis and Vincent's broken legs make the operation doubly difficult. Finally Eugene has nothing left in his stomach to vomit.  He drops to the floor in exhaustion.  Vincent, also exhausted from the effort of holding Eugene over the bowl, joins him on the broken linoleum.  Both men stare up at the ceiling that carries a map of the constellation.",

JEROME wheels EUGENE out of their housing project.  He takes in the neighborhood for the last time.  We focus on a POOR COUPLE cradling an INFANT. JEROME (VO) Those parents who, for moral or, more likely economic reasons, refrain from tampering with their offspring's genetic makeup or who fail to abort a deprived fetus condemn their children to a life of routine discrimination. We glimpse other PEOPLE in the neighborhood.  They appear poor but, for the most part, physically normal.  However a pall of gloom hangs over them. JEROME (VO) Officially they are called \"In-Valids\"*.  Also known as \"godchildren\", \"men-of-god\", \"faith births\", \"blackjack births\", \"deficients\", \"defectives\", \"genojunk\", \"ge-gnomes\", \"the fucked-up people\". [* \"IN-VALID\" pronounced as in \"an invalid license\"] JEROME (VO) They are the \"healthy ill\".  They don't actually have anything yet - they may never. But since few of the pre-conditions can be cured or reversed, it is easier to treat them as if they were already sick. As they enter a car, driven by GERMAN, Jerome spies a beautiful young GIRL, 11, sitting on the steps of the housing project, staring forlornly into space.  While there is no outward sign of any deficiency, she is somehow aware that she is damaged goods. Jerome glances in the rearview mirror. JEROME (VO) By means of a donor I have cheated the system for the last four years to open doors that would otherwise be closed to me. Jerome wheels Eugene into the palatial condominium complex where the two men now reside. INT.  GATTACA.  PRESENT DAY. We return to JEROME's reflection in the glass.  Other GATTACA EMPLOYEES are gradually gathering behind him. JEROME (VO) In the guise of Jerome Morror I have risen quickly through the ranks of Gattaca.  Only one of the Mission Directors has ever come close to discovering my true identity. We now see what Jerome has been gazing at through the window the whole time - the sight that has brought a hush to the complex.  Through an open office door lies the body of a large man - the MURDERED DIRECTOR, lying where he has just been discovered, in a pool of his own blood. JEROME (VO) Strange to think, he may have more success exposing me in death than he did in life. Jerome wipes his eye and also goes to investigate.  We focus on an extreme close up of his EYELASH.  Loosened by Jerome's hand, it breaks free and floats gently down to the floor where it comes to rest. INT.  GATTACA AEROSPACE CORPORATION.  MORNING. DETECTIVE HUGO, late-forties, wearing a crime-scene hygenic suit and gloves and a full clear mask - looking more like a surgeon or a toxic waste worker than a detective - places a blood- spattered computer keyboard alongside the Director's shattered skull.  The indentations match the blunt corner of the keyboard. Hugo detaches the dangling keyboard from its parent computer and seals the likely murder weapon in a marked, transparent plastic bag. A CREW of similarly-suited homicide detectives systematically vacuum the surrounding office area with metallic, industrial- looking mini-vacs.  Once each work space has been vacuumed, the transparent plastic vacuum bag is detached, sealed and labelled. OTHER DETECTIVES video the scene with camcorders.  Video prints spit out of the cameras for instant inspection. EXT.  GATTACA - LANDSCAPED GARDENS.  DAY. A silicon police tape cordons off the crime scene.  From the landscaped garden, a crowd of GATTACA EMPLOYEES view the proceedings through the glass walls.",

Without thinking, he breathes on the glass and rubs the smear away with his elbow.  Nearby, elderly janitor, CAESAR notices Jerome's fastidious act and reads the panic in Jerome's eyes.

The lead homicide detective, DETECTIVE HUGO, finishes interviewing a GATTACA SECURITY GUARD and approaches the Investigator. A large telescope in the background. Although Hugo is deferential to his more youthful superior, his body language betrays his displeasure.  Hugo clearly does not relish the Investigator's involvement in his case.",
