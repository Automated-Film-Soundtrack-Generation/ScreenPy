The speeding Ford avoids a halting car, then suddenly spins out of control, jumps across the sidewalk, splinters a wood bench, and finally slides in a complete circle across the grass of a small park.

Suddenly a gun appears in his right hand, aimed at Jackson. The pistol roars bucks, roars, bucks again. Jackson is shot through the head twice. THE FORD IS SEVERAL BLOCKS BEHIND RUDY. DOC DOWNSHIFTS avoiding stalled cars. Carol grasps at both the seat and the dashboard handholds to maintain her balance. THE BUICK EMERGES THROUGH DENSE PLUMES OF SMOKE. Fire licks along the one edge of the sidewalk. RUDY IN THE BUICK HAS NOW ALMOST CLEARED THE TOWN. He tears along the highway... sweating a little but becoming cool. He is a pro. His watch cap is now removed. ON THE CURVE - Jackson's body is kicked out of the automobile and bounces across the pavement. DOC IN THE FORD POWERS ALONG. He approaches the flaming building, then hits the brakes as ... A BIG DIESEL TRUCK AND TRAILER is coming in the opposite direct ion,, jack-knifes across the road, desperately trying to avoid the cars stopped in the middle of the street . DOC, AS THE TRUCK AND TRAILER SUDDENLY APPEAR THROUGH the smoke in front of him, throws the car broadside into a four wheel drift. Now sideways, then straight, he bumps across the sidewalk, over a patio of a house, knocking down two pillars, through a parking lot, taking with it a large cleaners sign, then bores back onto the road. RUDY IN THE BUICK STROKING ALONG THE OPEN HIGHWAY. Looks in the rear view mirror. RUDY'S POV - THROUGH THE BUICK'S REAR WINDOW, BLACK smoke is visible billowing skyward. DOC AND CAROL IN THE FORD NOW DRIVING CALMLY THROUGH the countryside. A police car with light turning and siren wailing passes them, heading for the conflagration in Beacon City. Doc's eyes follow the Patrol Car until it disappears from sight. THE BUICK - SERIES OF ANGLES - IT pulls off the highway and bumps down a dirt road. Rudy strains to hold the big car on the rutted pathway. (CONTINUED) 37. CONTINUED: The dirt road becomes a lane. A farm house and barn appear at a clearing. Rudy powers the car up a fairly steep hill, the crest of which is occupied by a seemingly abandoned and dilapidated house barn. RUDY JUMPS OUT OF THE BUICK, trots to the front of the barn and pulls the double-doors open. A station wagon with wooden- panel or the usual painted panel sides can be seen within... THE FORD SWEEPS OFF THE HIGHWAY and onto the dirt road. WITHIN THE FORD - DOC IS DRIVING. Carol peels off her sweater. She has worn a faded blouse underneath... She pulls a ribbon; her hair falls changing her appearance. RUDY - IN THE BARN - The Buick is now parked near the Station Wagon. Standing in the shadows, he intently reloads his gun, then moves towards the large doors of the barn. CAROL - IN THE PASSENGER SEAT OF THE FORD - she watches as Doc drives up the lane... RUDY stands outside the barn as the car approaches. DOC STUDIES RUDY THROUGH THE WINDSHIELD, watching him wipe his face with a soiled rag as the car pulls closer... INT. BARN DOC PULLS THE FORD TO A STOP just within the double doors. He passes Rudy, leaving a clear exit pathway for the getaway station wagon. DOC JUMPS OUT OF THE FORD AS SOON AS the ignition switch is cut; Carol a beat behind him on the opposite side. Rudy moves into the archway created by the barn's open doors. He stands almost in silhouette as the bright sunlight breaks around him. Doc snaps open the door of the car, his back turned to Rudy. He reaches into the back seat and grasps the black suitcase, not by the middle handle but by each end, as if it contained a great weight.",

Closing and re-locking the door, the Woman quickly moves away.

Doc is faster and more agile than the thief, but the station is unfamiliar territory to him. Both Doc and the Thief move carefully, they must not arouse enough attention to make themselves conspicuous, thus risking police interference. THE THIEF HURRIES ALONG THE MAIN CONCOURSE weaving between the incoming and departing passengers that dot the long corridor. DOC IN PURSUIT DOWN THE CONCOURSE, he passes several sealed off departure/arrival gates. THE THIEF STEPS OFF THE CONCOURSE INTO GATE THREE, an open stairway winding downward. DOC FOLLOWS HIS QUARRY DOWN THE STAIRWAY to the train area where he immediately skips over the winding ramp and onto the loading platform. Emerging from the short tunnel, Doc isn't surprised that the Thief is again nowhere in sight. Doc steps behind a pillar -- he waits watchfully... After a moment or two, the Thief edges out from behind another column and starts back up the platform towards the concourse. (CONTINUED)",

THE FLYER STANDS GLEAMING AT TRACKSIDE, perpendicular to the boarding gate. Two doors to the train stand open, one in the pullman section, the other entrance admitting day coach passengers. CAROL - ON THE MAIN CONCOURSE - MOVING ALONG WITH THE FLOW of about-to-depart passengers... the Flyer comes into sight, visible on the next level below. THE CONDUCTOR - AT TRACKSIDE - STANDS SMILING BROADLY by the coach entrance. He grins at the boarding PASSENGERS as he speaks to a nearby BRAKEMAN. The Thief skirts around a baggage-laden elderly COUPLE and moves up the two-step and into the rail car passageway. DOC MOVING QUICKLY AGAIN. He sees the Thief slip past the conductor and into the train. THE THIEF IS NOW INSIDE THE DAY COACH. He heads toward the forward compartments. DOC EXPERTLY SQUIRMS THROUGH THE BOARDING THRONG and disappears past the conductor up into the passenger car vestibule. ON THE CONCOURSE CAROL WATCHES AS A BLONDISH MAN in a grey suit skips aboard the Flyer standing below. She is unable to get a clear look at the man, and is unsure as to whether or not it was Doc. She hesitates, then moves forward to Gate Three which will take her down to trackside... Carol stands at the edge of the gate -- the last of the crowd having already passed through. She hesitates again, staring down at the shining train. INT. FLYER - DAY COACH THE AISLE IS CLOGGED WITH PASSENGERS. People hesitate over their selection of seats, put baggage into overhead racks, clumsily remove their overcoats... The Thief continues to move forward, squirming around the passengers at a hurried but controlled pace. 61. AT THE END OF A PULLMAN DOC ENTERS, THREADING HIS WAY FORWARD, scanning faces. He is one car behind the Thief and losing ground, due to the fact that Doc must carefully note the occupants of each seat as he passes. Doc is further delayed by a WOMAN blocking the aisle. She struggles painfully, trying to fit a suitcase into an overhead carriage. Doc, with the most forced of smiles, reaches up to help her. 30? THE THIEF MOVES THROUGH ANOTHER VESTIBULE and into an 30? empty car -- now unobserved, he immediately breaks into a run. DOC LOOKING, MOVING NIMBLY INTO ANOTHER VESTIBULE AND CAR. The passengers have become fewer and fewer as he nears the front of the train. THE THIEF RUNS THROUGH ANOTHER VESTIBULE AND INTO A SMOKER. This car also deserted, he maintains his trotting pace, swinging the heavy suitcase as he goes... reaching the end of the smoker, he enters the next vestibule and attempts to move into the following car, but the Thief is brought to a halt by the sudden dead end of the passageway. The next car holds only baggage. He has reached furthest forward passenger car. The Thief desperately tries to open the vestibule door, hoping to escape by jumping off the train, but the doors are tightly locked. He begins to retrace his steps. DOC MOVES CAREFULLY INTO THE NEXT CAR FORWARD, still unknowingly two cars behind the Thief. THE THIEF PASSES BACK TO THE VESTIBULE AT THE REAR OF THE SMOKER, his eye suddenly catching the Men's Lounge. He tries the door -- locked. The Thief snaps out a pen knife, picks the lock with a deft movement. Passengers are visible behind him as he works, filtering into the pullman car following the smoker. None of them notes his activity. The restroom door swings open. INT. MEN'S LOUNGE The Thief immediately snaps the bolt-lock shut behind him, crosses the small, murky room and tries to lift the window. He strains mightily but the glass remains hopelessly jammed... DOC ENTERS THE FINAL PASSENGER CAR, notes the half 313 dozen travelers and continues moving forward, going next into the smoker. (CONTINUED) 62. CONTINUED: THE SMOKING CAR IS EMPTY, although several Passengers and a PORTER enter it moments after Doc leads the way. Doc passes through the length of the car, moves into the vestibule and, like the Thief a few moments before, finds his passage blocked by the baggage car. Doc hesitates, then turns and begins going back in the opposite direction. DOC STOPS AT THE MEN'S LOUNGE -- staring hard at the door for a moment. He tries the handle. The door remains firmly shut.",

Swain and Hayhoe, limping, and Cannon and Max start for the stairwell in direct pursuit of Doc and Carol. All the men, save the Accountant, now have guns in their hands. SWAIN AND HAYHOE CAUTIOUSLY GOING UPWARD. Still below the first level landing, their eyes search overhead. The SOUND of Doc and Carol's pounding feet can be heard. HAYHOE LEANS OUT OVER THE BANISTER, points his gun directly up and fires. DOC AND CAROL BETWEEN THE FIRST AND SECOND FLOOR landings as Hayhoe's bullet tears by, ripping through the wooden banister supports. INSIDE THE ELEVATOR THE ACCOUNTANT AND CULLY WATCH the arrow indicator pass \"Two.\" DOC AIMING HIS .45 RESTING IT ON THE BANISTER He fires two shots back down the stairwell. SWAIN AND HAYHOE MOVING UP THE STEPS TWO AT A TIME Suddenly Hayhoe's leg buckles as a .45 slug tears through his hip, the other bullet ripping the plaster wall near his shoulder. SWAIN IS NOW BESIDE THE BANISTER, he points his 54l revolver straight up... empties it. DOC AND CAROL AS SWAIN'S BULLETS BREAK AROUND THEM. Doc pulls Carol down, lifts the riot gun and fires down the stairwell with a huge roar. THE STAIRCASE TEN FEET IN FRONT OF SWAIN IS SMASHED by Doc's blast. Swain has to climb over the uprooted planking to continue moving upward. Cannon following. THE ELEVATOR INDICATOR STOPPING AT \"THREE\" CULLY PULLS OPEN THE DOOR, MOVES OUT INTO THE corridor. The Accountant remains within the elevator. SWAIN ON THE STAIRWAY FIRES HIS PISTOL UPWARD CAROL, ON THE STAIRWAY ABOVE, AS THE SHOTS SMASH PAST, runs ahead of Doc by three steps. They pass the second landing, keep moving upwards towards the third. (CONTINUED) 103. CONTINUED: Doc's focus of attention is downward. He knows that he and Carol are being pursued up the stairwell, but he isn't aware of the fact that the gunsels have split their forces. RUDY ON THE THIRD FLOOR AGAIN RISES LIKE LAZARUS FROM THE DEAD. His head bloodied from Doc's heavy pistol, he slowly wobbles to his feet. Rudy looks down at Fran... she sobs violently, her back leaning against the wall. Rudy picks up his .44 then stumbles into the open door of Doc and Carol's room. He unsteadily crosses to the bathroom, closes the door. CAROL FRANTICALLY MOVING UPWARD, DOC HAS NOW FALLEN five steps behind. DOC FIRES THE .45 DOWN THE STAIRWELL AT SWAIN ON THE THIRD FLOOR Cully walks cautiously down the corridor, pistol raised. He moves toward the landing, having covered one quarter of the distance from the elevator. The Accountant is still within the elevator. Carol comes up the stairwell and looks back for Doc. The SOUND of Swain's pistol and Doc's answering .45. Carol senses a movement; she turns and sees Cully's gun leveled at her. As Carol screams: Doc dives onto the landing facing the corridor... his plane of movement knee high.,, the riot gun in his left hand, .45 in his right. CULLY IS HIT IN THE CHEST BY BUCKSHOT. The killing wounds fling him upward as he fires his own gun... his aim destroyed by the death blows,, the bullets stray above Carol, high of their mark. DOC FIRES THREE TIMES MORE AT THE ELEVATOR CABLE THE CORRIDOR WALL NEAR THE ELEVATOR IS SMASHED BY ONE OF the riot gun's jumbo shots, as is the top of the elevator. The plaster flies away revealing further damage. The cables are smashed, the elevator breaks loose and plummets downward. THE EMERGENCY CABLE, INSIDE THE SHAFT THE MECHANISM TRANSFERS OVER, line catching within the pulley housing. The line snaps taut - halting the speeding car. WITHIN THE LOBBY 104. AS THE ELEVATOR SLAMS TO A WRENCHING STOP FIVE FEET ABOVE the floor level. The Accountant bounces from the floor of the car to the ceiling, then back to the floor. Laughlin leans across the reception desk in great pain. He sees the suspended car through the iron grill door. The Accountant lies completely still on the floor of the elevator. His head and neck twisted at an oblique angle. DOC ON THE THIRD FLOOR LANDING HE JAMS SEVERAL SHELLS INTO HIS RIOT GUN WHILE HOLDING his .45 ready for an appearance by Swain. Reloading completed, he stands, with Carol. He again begins to move upward. SWAIN FIRES FROM THE STAIRWELL DOC STOPS, SETS BOTH THE RIOT GUN AND THE .45 on 562 the banister... He waits... on the winding staircase below him there is a dark movement. DOC FIRES BOTH GUNS THE STAIRWELL AROUND SWAIN DISINTEGRATES. The thug is obliterated by the firepower. DOC CANNOT SEE THE EFFECT OF HIS SHOTS. He again resumes his flight upward. INT. DOC'S BATHROOM RUDY HOLDS HIS BLOODY HEAD IN THE SINK BOWL, DUMBLY splashing water over himself. Carol's underwear is still present. Rudy's pistol lies on the soap tray. THE LANDING AS DOC AND CAROL COME POUNDING INTO VIEW. No further avenues open, they turn down the corridor. Doc grabs Carol and pushes her into the room, past Fran; he kicks the door shut. INT. THE ROOM DOC GRABS THE SUITCASE, RUNS TO THE WINDOW, TEARS off the shade, lifts the frame, looks. The drop is too far. He grabs Carol and runs into the hallway. INT. CORRIDOR THEY RUN DOWN TWO DOORS AND BREAK IN. Over the door is the sign \"Fire Escape.\" 105. INT. FIRE ESCAPE ROOM DOC HELPS CAROL OUT ONTO THE FIRE ESCAPE. He aids her with his left hand, the riot gun now clutched tightly in his right. He motions, she hands him the suitcase and follows. EXT. FIRE ESCAPE THEY DESCEND THE FIRE ESCAPE. They reach the end. The fire escape stays rigid. Doc cautiously steps on to the tilted steps. He turns and with the suitcase crosses to the end. Throws the bag and the shotgun across the 6 foot gap to the retaining wall, preparing to jump. RUDY COMES OUT OF THE ROOM ONTO THE FIRE ESCAPE holding his .44. He looks down at Doc, then slowly raises his gun. Carol screams. DOC JUMPS. RUDY FIRES. DOC IS HIT IN THE SIDE (flesh wound). In the air he spins and lands. Rudy fires again and again as he runs down the fire escape. Doc rolls, picks up the shotgun and fires. RUDY'S TIME HAS COME. THE JUMBO CHARGES MASH HIM BACK against the wall and off the fire escape. CAROL RUNS ALMOST STAGGERING AND GETS READY TO JUMP the six feet. THE FIRE ESCAPE. BEGINS TO SINK. CAROL LOOKS AT DOC mutely, as she sinks beneath the retaining wall.",
