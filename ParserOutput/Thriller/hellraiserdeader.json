She freezes for a beat, then after determining that the Man is asleep, she slides her way off the mattress and rolls quietly onto the floor. S he's relieved when she finds that she's still dressed. She snatches a small TAPE RECORDER off the ground and clicks rewind -- satisfied. She snatches a half empty pack of smokes off the floor and she's gone. EXT. A BUILDING ON THE LOWER EAST SIDE OF LONDON - DAY A big sign identifies this old brick building as the home of \"The London Underground\" -- a weekly newspaper in the \"Village Voice\" mode, only scuzzier. INT. OFFICES OF THE UNDERGROUND - DAY MAIN TITLE SEQUENCE: A pair of elevator doors open. AMY KLEIN exits and walks towards camera. She's all in black, from her black sneakers and black stockings up to her tinted glasses and jet black hair. The only thing about her that isn't black is a complexion so translucently pale that it bespeaks only the most rare and grudging familiarity with daylight. She has a paper coffee cup and a cigarette in the same hand, and she alternates sips of coffee with puffs of her cigarette with a practiced proficiency. She ignores the unhappy looks of her fellow employees. She clearly has practice at this as well.

She descends the long, non- working escalator -- the only one on it at this time of night. She reaches the subway platform. It is virtually empty.

She scans the far end of the platform, past a lone FIGURE in a SHINY GREEN PLASTIC RAINCOAT who lies motionless on a bench. - a couple MIDDLE-AGED GUYS in security uniforms, maybe heading for some night shift somewhere, stand, not moving, hands thrust in pockets. She turns back to the bench but the FIGURE in the SHINY GREEN RAINCOAT is gone. She takes up a position at the far end of the platform. She waits. A moment later, a bit of a breeze starts moving her hair. A few seconds later, a train comes roaring into the station. Amy watches the car pass her, one by one, as the train slows. The train is virtually empty. One car after the next rolls by as the train slows. Finally, as the train moves slowly to a stop, a car different from the others comes in.

The various participants, some of whom we recognize from the videotape movie, are standing crowded around something on the floor.

She nervously puts a a finger into the hole and inspects the blood. The sound of the exhalations is coming from the unseen place. Then somebody in the circle moves, to get a better vantage point, and now Amy can see, clearly, what is going on. Winter is lying on top of the corpse of a YOUNG MAN, breathing into his mouth as he did with Katya. An almost sexual encounter yields the same results as the tape. He takes a final deep breath. And then, as before, the Young Man gasps. Winter pulls away. As he does, we can see the Young Man's face, smiling, despite the knife that is lodged into his chest.

He leans in close. WITH AMY Amy leans in close as well. WITH WINTER He draws in another breath -- he seems to be in agony as he does it -- presses his lips to Katya's dead ones, and exhales. The breath seems to go on forever -- longer than it should. And then, when it seems as if Winter can't breathe out another teaspoon of air, Katya's body abruptly twitches beneath him -- and then she sucks in a ragged breath. Her previously open and lifeless eyes, move. Her head raises up. WITH AMY She simply stares, breathing again for the first time in a moment, unable to quite take in what she's seeing. ON THE SCREEN Winter, exhausted, looks down at Katya, smiling. There's nervous laughter, sounds of relief from around the room. Winter slides off of her. Katya looks this way and that, presumably at the others, looking down at her. A hand reaches down and she takes it. The camera follows as Winter pulls her unsteadily up to standing. All this despite the fact that there is still an exceedingly large and obvious hole in her head... the size of a dime on one side, the size of a half-dollar on the other. The others move in, touching her, congratulating her. She's still a bit shaky, uncertain. Then she lifts one of her hands to the side of her head -- the side with the big exit wound. She touches it gingerly, confirming that it is really there. Then she slowly slides her fingers IN. They penetrate her skull, unobstructed, to the second knuckle. Katya takes her fingers from this ghastly wound and stares at them, bloody. Yet she's alive. Fine.",

Amy steps cautiously in. She looks toward one side, sees a closet with a double sliding door. She slides open one side, sees nothing that shouldn't be there -- a ragged winter jacket, a green plastic raincoat, a hangar festooned with scarfs, some other garments still obscured beneath cleaning bag plastic. She hesitates, then calmly slides the other side open. More of the same. She turns in the other direction. There's a little kitchen. Nothing dead there. She starts forward then turns back -- staring at the refrigerator. She goes quickly over and tugs it open. It's empty. Not so much as a ketchup bottle. Curious, she opens the freezer. The same. Empty. She heads through the living room and down a narrow corridor leading to another bedroom. At the end of the hallway is a bathroom. The door to the bathroom is open and the toilet, on the far wall, faces the door. Marla is there. Dressed only in bra and panties, she is sitting on the closed lid of the john, leaning forward in what seems, at first, to be an impossible angle. Her hands hang forward, almost touching the floor. Her head is cocked back, staring up. Her skin is gray, swollen. Amy takes a few steps forward, for a better look. As she approaches, she sees the reason for the odd position of the body. A long boot-lace has been tied around Marla's neck and tied to the wall pipe on the toilet. The flesh of her neck has swollen out, almost burying the boot-lace. She has hanged herself in this ghastly way. Amy takes another step forward. As she does, there's a sudden loud buzzing as the flies that crawl on Marla abruptly rise up, alarmed (or whatever it is flies are) at her approach. But they soon return to the corpse, crawling about the face, around the edges of the glazed, eyes, around the margins of the open mouth, rimmed with dry foam -- around the out-thrust tongue.",

IN THE BEDROOM Amy starts to search -- fast, thorough, -- she's done this sort of thing before. She finds a journal, opens it... no writing. She tosses it aside. Pulls open a drawer. She tugs out what looks like a blade-less knife handle. She presses a stud. A STILETTO BLADE SPRINGS OUT. She tosses it back in the drawer, tugs some other stuff into view. Some bills, some shoelaces, loose change. She goes drawer to drawer, looking for anything that might mean something. Socks, ragged underwear, cheap jewelry, tee shirts and short skirts and jeans. Amy stops, surveying the territory. Where to look next? Then, deciding, she goes to the bed. She reaches under it, sliding her hand around, tugs out a dust-encrusted skirt. Feels around some more, hesitates, pulls something else out. She brings it out into view. It's a desiccated mouse. She grimaces and tosses it back under the bed in disgust. She stops... then slides her hand between the mattress and the box spring. She feels around, then stops, finding something. She pulls out a little red paper folder -- the kind that photographs come from. She opens it. It appears to be a photographic record of another \"deader\" party. We see some of the same participants -- we also see Marla herself in some of the pictures. She's smiling. Amy flips the next photograph. It shows Marla next to Winter. He's holding something in his hand. Amy looks closer. THE PUZZLE BOX -- Amy turns another photograph and it shows somebody holding the box out in front of Marla. The picture is framed through a length of rope with a noose on one end. Marla is on the other side-- Almost a kind of \"joke\" photo. She has a kind of sickly smile on her face. Amy's eyes narrow. She holds the picture closer. There seems to be a figure lost in shadows, and the closer she looks the more reality merges with the grains of the photo. What is there? A man?",

Amy turns toward the door that leads to the hall and the unseen bathroom. She sits, silent, waiting. Then the sound of the scratching comes again. The sound of flies rising -- and again, more distinct -- something scratching. She keeps her position, still listening. Nothing. Just the slow steady, untroubled buzzing. She moves toward the bathroom. And again there's the tiny scratching, and the rush of sound, as if something has disturbed the flies. The sound stops. The flies are still except for the occasional buzz. She advances, until she can glimpse the edge of one of Marla's hanging, out-thrust hands, the tip of one finger just touching the floor. Marla's long fingernails are painted green. THE BATHROOM She comes around the edge of the bathroom door. Marla is motionless. She leans from the pipe by the shoelace. The shoelace is still buried in her throat. The flies buzz up again.   The glazed eyes remain fixed in their sockets. One of her hands is not visible from Amy's position.. We see scratches on the floor beneath her fingernails. Amy steels herself -- and then walks closer. On the corner of the sink, there's a thick manila envelope with something bulky inside -- something that looks just like a cassette tape. There's a name written on it, and the marker is right next to it. It reads \"AMY\" Amy must reach past the corpse in order to reach the envelope, horribly close to the body in doing so. She enters the cramped space and reaches toward the sink. She is about six inches shy of grabbing it. She notices that her hip is almost touching Marla's face as she leans. The flies stir. The stench rises. She stretches closer, and Marla's body is pushed aside a few inches. Closer and closer AMY reaches.",

As she pulls the envelope up, she notices something else in Marla's hidden hand. THE PUZZLE BOX. Amy reaches over and pries open Marla's hand. Her blackened fingers snap as they are pulled off the box. Amy grabs the box and envelope, stuffs them into her bag, and stands. As she stands next to Marla's body suddenly- MARLA'S HAND GRABS AMY'S LEG! Amy shrieks and swats the dead hand away, falling backward onto the floor as she does. She rolls over and, in a half- crawl, half-scramble, gets herself back up to her feet. Amy backs up against a wall, kicking Marla as she kicks the floor. We can't tell if Marla is moving from the kicks or if she is somehow alive. Either way, its to much for Amy. She stops moving. Marla's mouth emits a ghastly sound as a stream of liquid falls to the floor. Its almost as if she is trying to speak. Amy has seen enough. Up she goes as she tears down the hall, through the living room and SMACK INTO THE MANAGER! Which needless to say, scares the shit out of her. He's standing inside the now open door to the apartment.",

Amy is sitting on the floor in front of her couch, now dressed in only panties and a bra -- an image unpleasantly reminiscent of Marla -- especially with the spotting of bruises and roughly bandaged scrapes on her pale skin. She has a dripping ice pack in one hand, which she applies to this bruise and that -- and a bottle of gin in the other. She doesn't look happy. She takes a drink, then looks toward a TV and VCR in front of her. There's a tape half-inserted into the VCR. We can see the empty envelope with \"AMY\" written on it, lying on the floor.",

She flags down a cab and hops in. EXT. POTEILARI AND MINVARA - DAY A ragged, run-down place, looking bleak and ugly in the bright light of day. We see the street sign, identifying the place -- Poteilari and Minvara. A cab pulls up and Amy gets out. She crosses the street, passes one side door -- and then comes to a building that's been sealed up -- doors and windows cemented shut with cinder-blocks. Beyond a narrow railing is a stairway, pressed up sideways against the building, running down to a basement entrance. Amy looks down the stairway to it's narrow bottom. The stairs and the bottom are littered with trash. A filthy mattress lies at the very bottom. Amy heads down. EXT. THE BOTTOM OF THE STAIRS - DAY At the bottom of the stairs, there's a wooden door. A hole has been punched through it and a heavy padlocked chain has been threaded through it and through a heavy hasp that's been bolted to the door frame. Some official government notice of some kind has been tacked to the door -- long rendered unreadable by the effects of time. Amy inspects the padlock. It's heavy and uncompromising. She tugs on the door and it opens to the limits of the chain -- but that's only a few inches. Amy peers into the darkness beyond, but can't see a thing. She looks down at the mattress that she's standing on, steps to the side and shoves it up. Then, as if the light breaks, she reaches out, grabs the hasp and pulls. The bolts holding the hasp to the wall are loose. They slide out with it. She tugs the whole thing free and pulls the door open. There is a narrow corridor beyond, all in gloom. Amy enters. INT.   THE CORRIDOR - DAY Amy steps in, her way illuminated only by the indefinite light that leaks in from the street.",

Amy ponders the chances of getting through it, and decides to check out the rest of the hallway. She works her way through a series of ominous corridors. Amy senses that she is not alone, stops, and turns around. No one. She continues. There is only a single door left -- at the far end of the hallway. It hangs half-open, but we cannot see what's inside. She approaches it, reaches out and pushes the door open. It's a bathroom. As she enters we see a FIGURE beyond her in the hallways, buried in the shadows. INT. THE BATHROOM - DAY This is one of those nasty little makeshift places built into an available corner -- basically a toilet and a sink so close that there's hardly room to move. A mop and some other supplies, long forgotten, are propped up in a corner. Amy steps in, looks down the toilet. Nothing left but some nasty stains -- the water long dried up. Her face brushes against something hanging in the air. She pulls back. It's a pull string hanging from a naked light bulb. She tugs on it. Nothing. No power here. She stands in the dark, claustrophobic place, puzzled. She looks back down the hall. It seems as if she's come to another dead end. Then she stares at the bathroom door. Open now, it blocks a piece of the bathroom wall -- the only place she hasn't looked. Amy steps back, virtually straddling the toilet, and pushes the door closed. As she does, of course, what little light there is, vanishes completely. If there's something behind the door, she can't see it, or anything else. Abruptly, there's a sharp click as she lights her lighter, and the wavering light illuminates the tiny bathroom -- and the previously unseen space behind the door. The walls do not meet there. There is a narrow gap, leading to a passage, apparently \"between\" the walls, perhaps ten inches wide.",

She holds the lighter up ahead of her, but its dim flickering light does not reach to the end of the passage. She moves forward cautiously -- the floor is littered with dried chunks of plaster, rotting insulation -- seventy-five years of stuff crumbled from the insides of the walls. As she disappears into the tunnel, the door slowly opens behind her. Passing across the rusty doorknob, a menacing blade appears. Inside the tunnel, Amy reaches a vertical pipe up against one side of the wall - - only a few inches thick, but it reduces the available room to under eight inches. She hesitates. Meanwhile, the lighter in her hand is getting hot. She lets it click off. In some dim half-light we can see her slipping a handkerchief carefully around it, for insulation. She flicks the flint. The lighter lights. And, abruptly, around a million roaches , which had returned from their hiding places in the absence of the light, go skittering every which way. Amy lets out a squeak as the roaches vanish in an instant.",

Finally, she reaches her hand up, over her head, passing the lighter from one hand to the other directly over her head. As she does, the lighter almost slips. She grabs for it, but it goes out. Again she is lost in virtual darkness. She strikes the flint. It flickers but doesn't light. As she strikes it again, IT LIGHTS SOMETHING IN THERE WITH HER! Amy doesn't see it, we do...

Her head facing away from her progress backward, trying to squeeze through. She holds up the lighter, it lights the area \"ahead\" which she cannot see.

Abruptly, there's the sound of a wettish \"thud\" and Amy seems to bounce a little. Her eyes open, but she isn't alarmed. Still lying on her back, she flicks her eyes this way and that, but, seeing nothing, she closes them again. A few seconds later, we see some black liquid trickle across her shoulder, coming from the unseen center of her back . It follows a course down her backbone, then swerves and finds a path along the inner edge of one of her shoulder blades, finally trickling down her neck. It continues to flow, staining the pillow by her face. She stirs slightly, clearly feeling the trickle. She puts her hand to her shoulder, smearing the black liquid. Still half- asleep, she tries to \"brush\" it off... but it continues to flow. Finally, her eyes open. She sits up painfully and looks at her hands -- stained with this sticky black stuff. She stares at it, not quite awake enough to figure it out. She reaches over her shoulder, pulls her hand back, stained with the black stuff. She looks down at her pillow, also stained. Confused, she rises, painfully awkward, and heads toward the bathroom. We can see that her feet leave blackish wet footprints across the floor as she moves toward the bathroom. INT. HOTEL BATHROOM - NIGHT She moves in, stares in the mirror -- sees the side of her face and her shoulder, smeared with black. She fumbles for the light, flips it on. In the sudden, shocking glare of returning light, COLOR abruptly re-enters the world... And the black of the liquid that's stained Amy's face and hands, that track the floor of the white-tiled bathroom, that smear the wall where she flipped on the light switch turns instantly to its true color -- The color of blood. Amy gasps at the sight -- she looks like she's just crawled out of a slaughterhouse. She reaches behind her, feeling her back, trying to find the source of the blood that seems to be pouring out of her, dripping to the floor, pouring down the small of her back, staining the back of her panties a vivid, ghastly red.",

The water drips to the floor, commingling with the blood, turning it a nasty pink. She reaches behind her back, feeling again -- her hand comes back as vividly red as before. Again she washes them. She stops dead, seeing something in the mirror. Something is glinting between her breasts. She touches her finger to it. It looks like a tiny bit of gleaming metal, poking out from inside of her, almost like a tiny steel splinter. It appears to have just barely broken through the skin from \"inside\" -- barely a drop of blood. She stands staring down at it, breathing fast. What the hell is it? Then, slowly, almost against her will, she turns her back to the mirror and looks over her shoulder. She sees -- and we see for the first time -- the center of her back where her questing hands couldn't reach. There is a knife there, literally thrust through the middle of her back. The gleaming splinter between her breasts is the tip of the knife that has literally transfixed her -- and clearly transfixed the center of her chest -- her heart. She strains her hands back, trying to reach this impossible thing, but her grasping fingers can't touch it. She turns back toward the mirror, staring into her own eyes.",

Hands trembling, she lays it across a wide strip of duct tape that she's unwound from a roll and laid down on the table, sticky side up. She presses the towel down so that it sticks, then picks up the tape, with towel attached. She slides the towel down the center of her back until it covers the wound, and then tugs the tape tight across her chest, compressing the towel against the wound. She takes the tape and awkwardly loops it around the towel and herself a couple more times, finally biting through the tape and tossing the roll away. She yanks yesterday's clothes up, discards the skirt in favor of a pair of black jeans. She tugs them up over her bloody legs, pulls a black shirt on over her top, thrusts her bloody feet into a pair of heavy shoes and finally tugs on a black leather jacket. She goes to the mirror, turns, trying to see how her profile looks with the towel stuffed in her back. She turns, about to leave... then realizes that her hands are red with her own blood. She hurries to the sink, rinses them off, and rinses the blood off of her face and neck, then grabs her bag and heads out the door. EXT. AMY'S HOTEL - NIGHT Amy comes unsteadily down out of her Hotel. EXT. DARK STREET - NIGHT More shadows than light. She comes around a corner and onto a narrow street, moving fast, her feet making loud echoey clip-clops on the street. There's a bum, dressed in rags, leaning up against the wall of a building. As she approaches him, he stirs slightly. Then she looks more closely. The man is eating something very crunchy. He stares at her blankly as he picks crickets off the wall and devours them, one by one. He offers her one, and smiles.",

It's coming up from a subway grate. She throws herself down on it. Down below she can hear the roar of a subway train passing below. Indirect, flickering light shines up from below. She looks up. There's a subway entrance. She hurries toward it. INT. TOKEN BOOTH - NIGHT Amy comes down the stairs. No sign of life. The fluorescent lights flicker - some dead. Amy fumbles for her metro card. This is one of those unattended entrances with entry through the top-to-bottom turnstiles. She starts through the turnstile. Then with a squeak, it sticks and she finds herself stuck half-way through, unable to move forward or backward. She tries to back out, but the thing won't turn in that direction. She heaves forward. It finally gives way. She looks this way and that, back through the turnstile, she sees her bloody footprints leading all the way through. Amy hears footsteps echoing towards her. Through a large mirror at an intersection, she sees the source of the footsteps. A cop on the beat. Amy looks down and sees she is standing in a pool of her own blood. The footsteps get louder. She sees a stack of newspapers next to her on a stand. She grabs one and throws it down in front of herself to cover the blood. It soaks threw in no time. The Cop is nearing the corner. She grabs another, then another, and throws them down. The pool of her blood leaks from under them all. The cop rounds the corner, he has a baton he taps against his leg. Amy grabs the whole stand and tips it over. With a loud SMASH, it spills the newspaper everywhere. As the cop walks in front of Amy, the blood is hidden beneath the pile of newspapers. Amy bends down to attend to the mess. She makes eyes with the Cop and shrugs her shoulders at her \"mistake\". The Cop smiles and nods, and keeps on walking. The sound of his footsteps vanish down the corridors.",
