We now get our first full unobstructed view of the gigantic creature, SPINOSAURUS AEGYPTICUS. Over forty feet long and twenty-five feet high, the dinosaur has a bony sail along its back. Its head is crocodilian with rows of long, curving teeth. Sinewy six foot arms terminate in three fingers hands with fourteen inch claws. Nowhere else to run, the group scatters into the brush as the two behemoth predators rush forward, their ROARS thunderous. Paul and Amanda scramble into one direction, Billy and Udesky in the other. But Grant can't go anywhere - his foot is stuck between two branches. He manages to free himself as the two dinosaurs approach. They'll have to deal with each other before eating the humans. Grant dives down between two fallen trees as the Spinosaurus and T- Rex circle one another like gladiators, each searching for the other's weakness. Laying flat on his back, Grant lets out a terrified GASP as the giant foot of Spinosaurus lands across the two trunks mere inches from his face. Spinosaurus lunges forward, powerful jaw open wide. T-Rex sidesteps the assault, its tail knocking down small trees as it spins out of the way. In the tress, Paul and Amanda scurry again for cover. Between the fallen trunks, Grant attempts to get away on his hands and knees. T-Rex presses the attack, slamming its tail into the flank of its adversary. Spinosaurus is knocked back, and Grant is again forced to duck for cover. As Spinosaurus struggles to regain its balance, T-Rex dives forward. Spinosaurus is driven backwards as T-Rex tries to grip its throat. Amanda yanks Paul out of their path. They Scramble over to Billy. Now on its side, Spinosaurus fights back ferociously. It slashes at T-Rex with its long arms and razor sharp claws, then finally kicks the animal with one mammoth foot. Tyrannosaurus staggers back, wounded. Down below, Grant is splashed by the blood pouring from the dinosaur, as he slowly makes his way towards his fellow humans. Spinosaurus lunges for the T-rex with gaping jaws and manages to topple T-Rex off its feet and sends the falling dinosaur to the ground. With an earth-shuttering CRASH, the dinosaur lands between Grant and the rest of the group. The companions scurry out of the way, but as they do so, the head of the T-Rex now lands almost directly on top of them. Plastered against an immense tree, the group watches in horror as T-Rex starts to rise but is thrown back down as Spinosaurus latches onto its throat. Spinosaurus crushes the life out of its adversary, and T-Rex opens and closes its jaw a mere inches from our terrified friends. Finally, Grant reaches the others.",

It's the resonation chamber model. A beat before he decides: It may not be the best choice, but it's the only choice. He blows through it, the same EERIE PITCH we heard before. On the third try, he's able to approximate the \"egg\" cry he heard the raptors give. He keeps it up, repeating over and over. Spinosaurus stops for a beat, confused How this sound could be coming from a non-raptor. But then keeps SMASHING. We can hear the mounting bolts STRAIN. Soon the whole crane will tip. But not before a MATCHING CRY is heard in the jungle. Grant stops, not certain he heard it. But there it is AGAIN. He keeps blowing. The crane is close to tipping when a single RAPTOR appears from the darkness, CHIRP-BARKING at the Spinosaur, who simply bats away. But then MORE RAPTORS come. And even MORE. Soon there are dozens gathering, circling. Grant stops signaling. All three survivors watch with horrified fascination, knowing their fate is perilous no matter which side wins. Looking at his adversaries, Spinosaurus ROARS. And suddenly the raptors attack. Spinosaurus easily handles the first few, but like ants they just keep coming. They climb up his back, slicing, into him with their razor-sharp claws.",
