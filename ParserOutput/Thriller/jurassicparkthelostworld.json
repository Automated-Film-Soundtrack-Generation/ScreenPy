Kelly puts a finger on the map, crossing westward, through the Pacific Ocean.  Thegre are dozen s of islands out here, but in the highlighted region, there is a semi-circle of five. Matanceros.  Muerte.  Tacano.  Pena.  And Sorna.  Underneath the whole island chain, there is a bold legend. \"The Five Deaths,\" it says.

The card wriggles against the lock and, with a soft CLICK, the door pops open.  KELLY herself tumbles out, wrapped in several blankets and carrying a mason jar half full of a yellowish liquid.  We can guess. She leaps to her feet, blinks the light out of her eyes, and bolts to the back of the trailer as fast as she possibly can. She races through a narrow door and SLAMS it shut.

It's no tree, it's a DINOSAUR'S LEG, a massive one, six feet across, God knows how many feet high.

Two APATOSAURS are startled from the bush and lumber out across the middle of the plain. The herd doesn't even break stride, but keeps running, scampering after the giants and stampeding right between their massive legs. One smaller pachycephalosaur bolts loose, but the motorcycle cuts it off and herds it back into the middle, which now takes the motorcycle right through the rising and falling legs of the apotosaurs. The bike chases the pachy out the other side, and as the apatosaurs disappear into the distance, the cycle isolates the juvenile. Another truck, a \"scissor rig,\" spots the isolated animal. High in the back of the truck, a HUNTER mans a tranquilizer cannon, drawing a bead on the pachy as the cycle runs it down. He FIRES and the tranquilizer dart hits the animal in the neck.  Its pace slows and another HUNTER from the truck tosses a lasso around its neck. They crank a winch, reeling in the animal. As the truck gain on it, two six-foot padded arms with what look like heavy airbags on the insides open up on the front of the truck. As the animal is pulled in, the scissors close with a hydraulic WHIR, trapping the animal between its airbags. Now a pick-up rig ROARS up and drops its back gate.  The scissor rig rolls forward, depositing the squirming pachy in this dino-contaiment vehicle. Two HUNTERS throw levers on the side of the scissor bars and the scissor rig backs away, leaving the animal, still pinched between the bars, imprisoned in the back of the pick-up rig. The Hunters quickly fit new scissor bars onto the scissor rig and it takes off, back into the hunt.",

The motor pool area is now a soggy lake of spilled gasoline. The saboteurs walk casually across the camp, unnoticed in the drunken revelry.  They pass several tents, the shadows of the partiers visible as they move inside. They continue across the camp and arrive at the other side -- -- to face the caged animals.  The carinthosaur that was tranquilized earlier stands there dully, eyes heavy and glassy, still under the effects.  They pass a stegosaur, its row of fine bristling. And finally they reach the largest cage, which houses a triceratops the size of a pickup truck, Nick pulls out his trusty bolt cutters.  He looks at them, a glint in his eye.",

Ludlow follows Roland. As they near a bend in the stream, Roland looks down, at the surface of the water.  A pattern of ripples moves toward them, washing over their ankles.  Roland follows the ripples with his eyes.  From up head, around the bend, he can hear the sound of an animal eating and drinking.  A very large animal. He reaches into his pocket and pulls out a  pinch of the ashes from the cooking fire that he scooped up earlier and releases that on the wind.  They float there for a second, suspended, then blow back at him.",

It's stooped over the stream bed, drinking.  Like a bird, it dips its head in the water and then straightens up, to let the water fall down its throat.  A dozen COMPYS are at the water as well, drinking. Roland gently FLICKS the safety on his gun to \"off.\" Ludlow edges toward the cover of a low-hanging branch.  As he puts his weight on one knee, it presses down hard on the middle of a small stick, which CRACKS in half.  Roland turns, eyes blazing. Out in the open, the tyrannosaur snaps its head sharply as well, staring in the direction of the sound.  But since Roland's own head is turned, he doesn't see the dinosaur's reaction.

They close around Ludlow's body, lift his straight up into the air, and toss him once, readjusting their grip so it is firmly around his midsection. The whole combination of movements takes but half a second. By the time Roland turns around, the animal has pivoted and darted back into the jungle, carrying Ludlow, still SCREAMING and writhing in its mouth.

She hurls herself over the seat and into the front as the animal penetrates even further into the car, but its torso will not fit through the window opening.  It pulls away. In the front seat, Sarah gets some very bad news. There's no windshield. The raptor springs up onto the hood, its claws CLATTERING on the sheet metal, and tosses its body through the opening -- -- just as Sarah hurls herself out the door.

The weight of the animal CRUSHES him into the floor, but the gun barrel now stands between them.  The raptor CHOMPS down hard on the barrel, its teeth GRINDING on the metal, and SNAPS its head, to tear it from Malcolm's hands. Malcolm pulls the trigger. The raptor's eyes pop wide as the dart SLAMS into the back of its throat.  It makes a GURGLING sound, then convulses violently and rolls off of Malcolm, yanking the gun from his hands as it falls and dies. Nick scrambles out from under the door.  Malcolm tries to wrench the gun from the raptor's clenched jaws, but it won't budge.",

She looks over her shoulder, down -- -- and sees ANOTHER RAPTOR, waiting for her on the roof of the building below. Sarah quickly rolls off the sliding section of roof, which keeps sliding, falling.  The raptor below jumps up, just in time to get WHACKED in the head by the falling roof section. Sarah tries to cling to the Spanish tile roof, fingers and nails slipping on the slick ceramic surface.  She slides all the way to the edge, grabs hold of the gutter, and dangles there, suspended above one raptor and trapped below another. The raptor above works its way down.  The one below leaps up, at her dangling legs.  She has left them in time with its jumps, to avoid losing her feet.  This can't go on for long. Desperate, she pulls one of the Spanish tiles up from the roof and hurls it at the raptor below.  It hits the animal in the head, for all the good that does. But Sarah keeps on, pulling and throwing more tiles.  She edges to the right, toward a fresh supply. The raptor above edges even closer, claws CLICKING on the slick roof. Something interesting is happening.  As Sarah pulls the loose tiles free, the ones above slide down, to take their place. Sarah sees this and pulls more free, knocking them out of the way as fast as she can. Suddenly an avalanche of loose tiles breaks loose and the footing underneath the raptor above disintegrates.  The animal's feet flail and grasp, it slides towards the edge amid the tumbling tiles. Sarah, seeing it coming, swings in close to the building, hugging it as closely as she can.  The raptor falls off the roof, right past her -- -- and CRUNCHES into the raptor below.  Both animals SNARK and attack one another. Now Sarah, her grip exhausted, falls too, landing right next to the enraged animals.  They fight and roll, RIGHT OVER HER. She GROANS and hugs the wood below her, the raptors continue to thrash and bite, they roll back, toward her, she rolls out of their way -- -- and plunges through a hole in the roof.",

Dizzy, bleeding, the breath knocked out of him, he opens his eyes and sees a sloping bank of dried mud. From behind him, he hears a CHIRPING sound.  He turns. He's in the tyrannosaur nest. The BABY TYRANNOSAUR faces him, still with a strange aluminum-foil cast on its leg.  The baby SQUEAKS with excitement as it toddles toward him. Ludlow scrambles to his feet, unsure what to do.  Both ADULT TYRANNOSAURS stand outside the nest, staring down at him. The baby runs toward Ludlow, so he turns and runs away. But in an instant, the male brings its head down, knocking Ludlow to the ground.  Then it raises its head again. Watching.  Waiting. Ludlow gets up again and tries to run, but now the female rex strikes, knocking him over again. Ludlow tries to crawl away, on all fours.  The male bends down and closes its jaws around one of his legs, holding it tightly.  Ludlow SCREAMS -- -- and the rex bits down decisively.  The bone breaks with a dry SNAP.  Ludlow HOWLS in pain, unable to move, and the baby toddles forward eagerly.  Ludlow can only stare as it leaps up, onto his chest, and opens its jaws wide. Peter Ludlow SCREAMS.",
