She throws off the bloody blankets, whips her legs off    the side of the bed, and tries to stand - THEN QUICKLY FALLS    OUT OF FRAME. WE HEAR THE CRASH BELOW FRAME. The Bride is flat on the floor. Her legs and feet don't work. Which means she's stuck on the floor with only a functioning top half, and a completely useless bottom half. What's a girl to do? INT.

She sees Gerald has a Trucker's knife in a holster attached to his belt. Her hands removes it. The Orderly swaggers down the hall to The Bride's room, red Reeboks slapping against the smooth floor. CU The BRIDE She SNAPS the knife's BLADE OPEN in her CU. The Orderly pushes open The Bride's door, stopping in shock.

Every time The Bride comes face to face with a tormenter, this Theme will play on the soundtrack. By mid movie this music should drive the audience wild with orgasmic anticipation of the carnage to come... ...and With the door in her hand and one mighty slam, this Longview Texas boy is sent to the Promised Land. She searches the dead man's    pockets,    coming up with a brown wallet that says on it, \"BIG    EL PASO    PIMPIN,\" loaded with lettuce. She also pulls out    a set of    car keys on a pickup truck key chain that has the    words,    \"Pussy Wagon\" on it written in a pimpy font. She    gathers    up all these items, and Gerald's knife, then begins    to strip    Buck of his orderly uniform. INT.

She wheels out of the elevator fast into the parking lot. Her arms spinning the wheels as she goes down the line of cars, looking for a pickup truck that Buck would own...she stops. What made The Bride stop. The ass end of a big, yellow 4x4 hard-body pickup truck, with flames painted along the side, and the words, \"PUSSY WAGON,\" written along the flat-bed hatch door. Pimpy font. The Bride looks at Buck's key chain in her hand. EX CU CAR KEY in truck door lock, it turns. EX CU TRUCK DOOR LOCK POPS UP OPEN. INT. BACKSEAT OF BUCK'S TRUCK - NIGHT The Bride pulls herself up into the backseat of Buck's pickup truck. Once in the backseat, she shoves the wheelchair away. It rolls out of control down the parking ramp, and CRASHES. Now The Bride's lying vertically in    Buck's truck's backseat. Seemingly out of danger - at least    out of sight - but she's still stuck hiding in the hospital.    And until she regains full use of her legs and feet, this    little Bride ain't goin anywhere or doin anything. Lying flat, with the back of her head propped up against the door, her long, lifeless legs stretched out in front of her, her two bare feet at the end of them, pointing to the sky, the Bride focusses her eyes, her stare, her thoughts, her strength, and all her concentration....on her big toe.

CU The BRIDE dressed in a kimono on the other side of the private dining room's paper wall.

When the Yubari sisters go back inside, the Bride climbs off her barstool and goes through the restaurant...into the parking area...and up to her rental car. She opens the door. Takes off her Japanese kimono, underneath is a one-piece yellow track suit with a black stripe going down both sides, like the one Bruce Lee wears in \"Game of Death.\" She tosses the kimono in the trunk, then removes the sheathed Hanzo sword. With the sword of vengeance in her hand, we follow her back inside the restaurant. She looks upstairs to the O-Ren dining room. We see Yuki Yubari and Sofie Fatale, slide open the door, and walk down the stairs together. When they get to the bottom, they give each other a kiss goodbye, and Yuki leaves the restaurant, while Sofie makes her way to the bathroom...only to have The Bride, now dressed in her Bruce Lee yellow outfit and samurai sword in her hand, bar her way.",

                    "raw_text": "...Trix Are for kids. This is something they used to say back when they fought alongside of each other as \"Vipers.\" The seventeen Crazy 88 reinforcements come running into the restaurant and with drawn swords surround The Bride. As a HEAVY METAL COMBAT BEAT begins to PULSATE ON THE SOUNDTRACK, The Boys and The Bride have a Spaghetti Western Stand-off. We do a 360 INSIDE the CIRCLE of The Crazy 88, who surround the yellow-haired warrior. Not all have Samurai swords; one JUGGLES TWO HATCHETS, another TWIRLS A THREE-STAFF TRIPLE IRON over his head. As the Heavy Metal music builds...We Cut to various Shots of The Two Opposing Forces Preparing to Strike....Hands on Sword Handles...Feet finding Combat Stance...etc... ....Until Heavy Metal reaches its Breaking Point... ...At that point, the Metal EXPLODES OVER THE SOUNDTRACK...IN TIME WITH The BRIDE EXPLODING INTO A VIOLENT KILLING MACHINE ON SCREEN. As she matches skill with the army of black-suited boys, arms flailing, silver blade Clashing and Slashing, long blonde hair whipping like a whirling dervish.... ...She's a Goddess of War Venus. Not only is the FIGHT CUT TO THE HEAVY METAL MUSIC, but The Bride seems to be somewhat dancing to it as she fights. This explosion of furious violence is punctuated CINEMATICALLY BY THE COLOR IN THE FILM POPPING OFF, and the fight being filmed in HIGH CONTRAST BLACK AND WHITE, turning the squirting, spewing geysers of BLOOD FROM CRIMSON RED TO OIL BLACK. Many members of The Crazy 88 are Sliced, Slashed, and liberated from the limbs they were born with at The Bride's blade. Some SPECIFIC MOMENTS While Clashing swords, The Bride whips the silver Boomerang out of its holster, and Throws it... ....It Twirls Through the Air... ...Embedding itself longways in one of the boy's faces. The Bride does a Mid-Air Somersault over the head of an Attacker, landing solid on her feet behind him...Slash, he's Out. The Bride is knocked to the floor, her Attacker stands over her to Spear the young blonde, Her Legs Spring Up In The Air, Ankles Lock Around The Boy's Neck. She throws him down to the ground. With his neck still in the vise-like grip of her ankles, She removes The SOG Knife from its sheath and Plunges it Deep Into The Boy's Chest. While still on the ground, an Attacker Charges at her. Yanking the Boomerang out of the Dead Boy's Face, She Sends It Flying in the Charging Man's path... ...Boomerang Twirling Through the Air Close to the Ground... ...Chopping Off the Charging Attacker's Foot in Mid Step, he falls flat. The Bride jumps up onto an attacker's shoulders. She locks her legs around him so he's helpless at shaking her off. ...she swings down with her sword, and cuts the man's hands off. So while the helpless man with no hands screams, the now nine foot tall Bride fights with the others. When she's through she brings the blade across the man she's perched on's throat. He falls to his knees, bringing the Bride back to the floor like an alevator. As soon as her soles touch ground, she's off his shoulders, somersaulting on the floor, bringing her blade up between an attacker's legs into his groin. He lets out a scream, as she yanks her blade free. ONE ATTACKER steps out from the rest, \"The Best One.\" He Twirls his sword expertly, challenging the young woman to, \"Come get a piece.\" The Bride does a screaming charge towards him.... ...Sword raised, The Attacker stands his ground, calm - steady, waiting for the blonde-haired locomotive to collide.....They meet..... SWING - CLASH - DANCE - SEPARATE - SWING - CLASH - SPIN - CLASH - LOCK - TWIRL - SEPARATE - They match each other blow for blow, till one makes a mistake. It's the male. The Bride's swing, that's neither clashed or blocked, slices off his right arm. ...The arm, still gripping the samurai sword, drops to the floor. The Bride pushes the Hanzo Sword right through the middle of his chest. Only half of the Crazy 88s that started the fight remain alive, or intact...They start to approach...The Bride, still holding the sword that's still impaling the skilled Attacker, backs up, keeping his body between her and the remaining killers. Like a boxer, The Bride uses the momentary break in the action, to rest on her feet.....THEN...yanks the blade from his chest cavity....The Body Twitches - Spasms - Grunts and Crashes to the floor. The Attackers start to close in...The Bride readies herself for their attack....THEN (in perfect time with the Heavy Metal)...Drops to the floor on her back, Spinning like a top. She Swings and Slashes and Cuts down below at their legs and feet, like some hellish samurai sword-weilding turtle flipped over on its shell.... Many black-suited, mask-wearing boys drop to the ground. ...Still Spinning like a break dancer, she spins up on top of her head, and Pops back up on her feet. And then there were seven. The seven remaining sword-weilding, black-suited boys moved out of range of the Bride's blade when she dropped to the floor. Now spread out, they make a large half-circle. The Bride, slowly points the tip of her blade to the floor, lowers herself to one knee and slightly bows her head. In repose. EX CU The Bride's eyes pointed up, watch them move closer, COLOR COMES BACK INTO THE FILM. We see her face is splashed with blood. O-REN WHIPS OPEN a red fan. GO GO stands by the restaurant's junction box, she flips the switch. The room goes dark. The Crazy 7 make a wide circle around the blonde who's still on the floor.... ...Looking down on her breathing hard in the shadows. As she breathes in and out, The FACE OF A LIONESS IS SUPERIMPOSED OVER HER FACE. Breathe in (Bride) - Breathe out (Lioness) - Breathe in (Bride) - Breathe out (Lioness) ..... The Bride rises to her feet... The Crazy 7 move in a circle around The Bride, she moves in a circle inside of their circle, all eight of them move in rhythm with the Metal... The Heavy Metal Music builds....to a big finish...THEN both Music and The Bride Explode! WIDE SHOT - FRAMED LIKE A KABUKI STAGE With the lights off, The White paper wall the eight killers fight in front of turns a Psychedelic Bright Blue. The snow falling outside is reflected against the paper wall like black snow falling on a blue shadow puppet stage. The eight samurais are Black Silhouettes against the blue backdrop. They begin to combat in a dance of blood, steel and death. The Bride does a sword-weilding dosey-doe with all sword-weilding partners. She CLISH-CLASH-CLISH-CLASHES with all of them - They seperate - stalk each other for a moment to the beat - then CLISH-CLASH-CLISH-CLASH again, with The Bride killing or hacking the limbs of one unlucky dance partner at each encounter - Sometimes during the separation, The Bride crouches down low in repose while the others continue to circle stalk...THEN...She Strikes again. We Cut in closer whenever we need to. Finally the last of O-Ren's soldiers falls to the Bride's sword. GO GO Standing by the junction box, flips a switch turning the lights back on. The electricity shines light on... The BRIDE Splashed all over with blood. Blood painting the floor, walls and ceiling. Dead bodies, several limbs, and horribly wounded men who have yet to die, litter the ground. With a big \"Whoosh\" in the air, the blood of O-Ren's subordinates fly off the blonde avenger's blade. Then saying to the foes who litter the ground.",

The wounded men, crawl out of the restaurant. The yellow-haired crimson-covered woman, looks to the last remaining combatants...Mr. Barrel, Go Go Yubari, and O-Ren Ishii. Go Go steps forward and removes her weapon, it's not a samurai sword. It's a heavy metal ball at the end of a long chain. She begins TWIRLING it above her head. Each rotation makes a WHOOSH sound in the air. BALL AND CHAIN in a 3-D-like effect, the metal ball comes right at us. The BRIDE ducks out of the way, the heavy ball destroying a large chunk of wood post behind her. Go Go eyes focused on her enemy...WHOOSH....WHOOSH....WHOOSH...she lets fly... The ball and chains wrap around the blade of the Hanzo sword... ...Go Go yanks... ...the Hanzo sword FLIES out of her grip. GO GO smiles...then...WHOOSH...WHOOSH... The BRIDE removes her boomerang and THROWS it at Go Go. The BOOMERANG TWIRLS through the air heading right for Go Go. BAM The young bodyguard    swats it out of the air with her ball and chain. She lifts up    her chain and the boomerang lies bent, on the floor. She looks    across at her opponent...WHOOSH... WHOOSH...WHOOSH..she    LETS FLY. It Strikes the Bride in the chest, knocking her    on her back... ...Go Go twirls it over her head and sends it towards the Bride on the floor. The Bride rolls out of the way, the metal ball PUNCHES a hole in an overturned table instead. The weaponless Bride wrestles a table leg loose from its purpose. She hops up on a table, table leg in hand, ready to fight. Go Go hops up on a table... As they fight they hop from table to table... Go Go throws her ball and chain... ...The Bride - QUICK AS A WHIP... BATS it away with the table leg. Go Go lets loose with the balls and chain...it wraps around the Bride's ankle...Go Go YANKS... ...The Bride's leg is yanked out from under her, she FALL CRASHING through another table. Go Go jumps on top of the Bride, attacking her with a samurai short sword. The Bride uses the table leg to block it. The women fight fiercely, locked in grapple, each face ugly with struggle. Go Go lets her left earlobe get too close to the Bride's mouth...the Bride BITES DOWN on it. Go Go screams as the lower part of the appendage is bitten off, and she rolls off the Bride. The Bride comes at her, bringing the table leg -- WHOOPS UPSIDE HER HEAD -- WHOOP-WHOOP-SIDES-HER HEAD. The girl in the schoolgirl uniform falls on her back, and delivers a powerful \"C.K.\" to the Bride from below, dropping her to her knees. O-Ren is UP, and wraps the chain around the Bride's neck and begins to strangle. The chain digs into the Bride's throat. The Bride brings the table    leg, which    has a couple of    nasty looking nails in it, hard    against the    Japanese girl's    thigh. The nails cut through the    plaid school    uniform skirt    into her flesh...the Bride rips out    the nails,    taking some leg    meat with them. Go Go lets out a horrific scream. The Bride brings the table leg down on the toe of the young girl's white tennis shoe. The nails stick in, the white shoe becomes stained with red. Go Go SCREAMS letting loose of the chain...falling on the floor. The Bride unwraps the chain around her neck, and begins breathing air into her lungs. Go Go tries to escape, dragging her fucked-up leg with her... The Bride rises from the floor and begins, twirling Go Go's weapon above her head. Go Go, fast as she can, climbs up the stairs to the second floor... The Bride stands at the bottom of the stairs, twirling the ball and chain over her head. Go Go frantically, and in great pain, climbs the stairs... She gets to the top. The Bride lets loose with the ball and chain... It HITS the female bodyguard and one half of the Yubari sisters, smack DAB in the back of the head. CU GO GO We see her face as she's delivered a death blow right behind it. We see behind her eyes and features, her life and spirit shatter like a teapot. Like a discarded rag doll, Go Go Yubari TUMBLES down the staircase landing in a pile at the Bride's feet. Dead before the tumble began. The Bride throws the ball and chain to the floor. Her eyes go to the last two remaining combatants... ...Mr. Barrel and O-Ren Ishii.",

We HEAR a CAR DOOR OPEN OFFSCREEN, then The Bride's bare foot comes from above FRAME, stepping down INTO The SHOT. She walks around to the driver's side and climbs in. She sticks Buck's ignition key in its slot and turns. The truck's engine RUMBLES to life. She spies a pair of Elvis T.C.B. SUNGLASSES lying on the dash. She puts them on. EXT. TEXAS STREETS/ INT. TEXAS STORES - DAY The Bride drives Buck's big, yellow pussy wagon all over El Paso buying supplies. WE FOLLOW Her bare feet into a clothing store. Her feet, legs, and ass slip into a new pair of LEVI'S. Her hands grab a pair of CHERRY BROWN COWBOY BOOTS. Then slips on the cowboy boots. Chooses another TOP. And finds a warm JACKET. She opens Buck's \"BIG EL PASO PIMPIN\" wallet, and pays for the items. She emerges from the store wearing her new outfit, and climbs back in the truck. She drives, stopping at a DEPARTMENT STORE, and walking inside. She picks up a SHOVEL, a HAND PICKAXE, a big CAMPING FLASHLIGHT, a MAP OF TEXAS, a writing NOTEBOOK, and a bunch of RED and BLACK FELT PENS. While the Bride is buying items in the department store we'll CROSSCUT.... ....with her driving the pussy wagon up to a low-rent motel called, \"The Texican\".... ...Her Registering with the OLD BASTARD of a desk clerk, getting the key, and paying him out of the \"BIG EL PASO PIMPIN\" wallet.... ...her drawing a bath in the bathroom of the motel room... Shampoo is taken off the shelf of the department store... ...conditioner... ...a bar of soap... ...hot water runs out of the bathtub faucet... ...steam rises off the hot bathwater... ...she pulls down a bunch of bath products, like bubble bath, salts, apricot this - kiwi that, we see her pour all the items in the bathwater... ...then we see her bare foot enter the bathwater... ...then Lower her whole body into the bathwater... ...now submerged in the warm bathwater, by herself, perfect MUSIC CUE ON SOUNDTRACK, she begins to cry...her poor heart has been shattered and five years of tears come flooding out of her. She cries for her baby... She cries for the motherhood robbed from her... She cries for all the innocent people at the wedding chapel, who died simply because they were unlucky enough to cross her path... She cries for the betrayal at the hands of her lover... She cries for the treachery at the hands of her comrades... She cries for the five years of life snatched from her... She cries for the countless violations she endured while incapacitated... And finally, she cries for all the misery she will cause the undeserving......enroute to Bill's retribution. Retribution that begins the minute she steps out of this bathtub. She curls up into a fetal position inside the tub of warm water...weeping. We DOLLY back...to give our heroine some privacy...WE DISSOLVE through the bathroom door...Till we're on the other side, filming a closed door with crying on the other side. When she's finished shedding tears, is when she'll begin shedding blood. When the bathroom door opens, the woman that emerges, has closed out all of her emotions...save from one...revenge. It's that woman, in her new outfit, that climbs into the yellow pussy wagon, puts the T.C.B. Sunglasses over her eyes, and starts the engine that sets into motion the gory story to follow. END OF MUSIC MONTAGE EXT./INT. BUCK'S TRUCK DRIVING IN DESERT (MOVING) - NIGHT POV THROUGH WINDSHIELD: The truck shines its headlight beams on an open patch of prairie wasteland. We see dirt, rocks, plants, and an oil derrick pumping up and down. The Bride STOPS the truck. Taking her flashlight with her, The Bride walks into the headlight beams towards one rock on the ground in particular. She lifts it off the ground, there's an X on it's underside. She    smiles.    If the X hadn't been there, she would have taken it    as a sign    that her vengeance quest was never meant to be. But    as it is    there, it would appear that fortune has smiled on    The Bride    and her bloody intentions. She walks back to the truck, takes the shovel and the hand pickaxe out from the flatbed, reaches into the truck cab and CHANGES THE MUSIC TO A POUNDING HEAVY METAL ANTHEM. CU The BRIDE'S COWBOY BOOTS next to the X ROCK IN TIME WITH The METAL, The Bride's cowboy boots count out ten paces from the rock. When the boots stop, the flashlight ENTERS THE SHOT illuminating the spot, THEN...the shovel ENTERS, striking deep in the unmarked earth. EXT. TEXAS DESERT - NIGHT Deep in the middle of Fuck-Knows Texas, lit by the headlights of Buck's 4x4, The Bride digs a hole in the ground......TILL... She HITS SOMETHING HARD. She gets down on her knees, hacking away at the dirt with the hand pickaxe, till a large box covered in plastic is revealed. She hoists it up out of the earth. She rips off the plastic, revealing a large, green Army footlocker, untouched by the condensation of being buried in the ground for over five years. Flipping the two locks open, she lifts the lid, placing the big camping flashlight on the rim. Unfolding a sleeping bag long-ways, she bought at the department store. The Bride begins collecting the contents of her buried treasure, and laying them on the sleeping bag. We see her remove them from the footlocker, one by one. The HEAVY METAL CONTINUES ON THE SOUNDTRACK. 2 9mm AUTOMATICS, w/ AMMO and HOLSTERS. 1 small HAND GUN, w/ AMMO and HOLSTER (which fits around the thigh). 1 SNUB NOSE .38 w/ ANKLE HOLSTER. 1 double-edged SOG KNIFE w/ HOLSTER 1 MOSSBERG PUMP ACTION SHOT GUN w/ AMMO 1 SILVER STEEL BOOMERANG, w/ a double-sided razor's edge w/ HOLSTER. 1 old fashioned STRAIGHT RAZOR 1 BLACK VERTICAL ATTACHE CASE. She flips it open, and inside broken down into four separate pieces is a HIGH-POWERED, SCOPE-SIGHT RIFLE. 1 MANILA ENVELOPE. She reaches in and pulls out a PHOTOCOPY OF HER SONOGRAM.

She paints her fingernails with bubble gum-colored nail polish. Yuki walks through LAX. Yuki standing next to a CAR SALESMAN on a California car lot. She points at a car in front of her. We see her cool convertible sports car and her finger pointing at it. We see Yuki behind the wheel of the sports car, driving as fast as she can through the twists and turns of the Hollywood Hills, laughing all the way.

The Bride shot up, pulls herself to the top of the stairs. She sees Yuki lying at the bottom, dead. Yuki's face, dead,    eyes closed...then they pop up open... Guess what...she's    not dead. Though she's bloody and her schoolgirl uniform    is filled with bullet holes she rises. Her head turns in the    direction of the Bride... The Bride sees this and can't believe it... They lock eyes... ...Yuki, who no longer has the machine gun, takes out a deadly looking knife and snaps it open with a smile that builds to a scream... She charges up the steps at the Bride. The startled Bride fires at her...the 9mm's empty... Yuki charging up the steps, yelling, knife raised high... The Bride, hurriedly removes the pistol she keeps in her ankle holster. Yuki chargin... The Bride cocks back the hammer... ...Yuki charging, getting closer... The Bride FIRES Bullet hits Yuki, stops her for a quarter of a second, but she keeps charging... The Bride fires again... Yuki jerks but keeps on charging... Bride fires... Yuki jerks, but keeps charging... Bride fires... Yuki jerks, keeps chargin, almost at her, knife raised high...

SHAW BROTHERS ZOOM into her eyes; VENGEANCE THEME plays on the soundtrack. Her hand removes her sog from its sheath. She moves through the crowd of Texas two-steppers, sog in hand, towards Budd sitting oblivious on his stool.... WHEN... Suddenly a BIG COWBOY stands up from his table -- spilling every bottle and glass on it -- and BARFS all over. Budd curses to himself, and heads over to the disaster area. The Bride...observes Him...CLEAN UP THE PUKE. EXT. TEXAS HIGHWAY - NIGHT As the music from above continues, we see Budd driving his pickup on an empty highway home from work. He passes by The Bride's    new red pussy wagon parked on the side of the road. After    he whizzes by, she starts up the motor, but doesn't turn    the lights on. She follows him, hanging way back in the    dark. Budd driving, not seeing the automobile cloaked in darkness, trailing him. EXT. BUDD'S TRAILER HOME - NIGHT Budd pulls his pickup truck in front of his small camper home. He walks inside, shutting the door behind him. The Bride rolls to a stop...Observing the lonely trailer out of her windshield... Texas tear-ass music begins coming out of the camper....We see his figure pass the camper window, once or twice. The Bride chooses her weapon -- Hattori Hanzo's samurai sword. She doesn't say anything, nor will an actress of Uma Thurman's caliber indicate her feelings, but the astute member of the audience will read the significance of her choice. His current status be damned, the Budd who owes The Bride satisfaction was a warrior. And it's that Budd she intends to send to his maker. She takes a black stocking cap, and slips it on top of her skull, tucking her blonde hair underneath... THEN... ...Rubs black make-up under both eyes, on top of both eyelids, and down the bridge of her nose... THEN... Disconnects the cab lights above her, opens the truck door, and slips out unseen into the Austin Texas night air. THEN... On her belly, Hattori Hanzo sword in sheath in hand, she crawls across the desert floor towards Budd's trailer. THEN... Somewhere in the vast outdoors a cat jumps on a rat. Their fight makes a LOUD racket. The Bride stops and buries her face in the dirt. From inside the trailer, we hear the needle being lifted off the phonograph. From a distance we see: The shadowy figure of Budd looking out the window of the camper. The Bride keeps her face in the dirt. The figure of Budd at the window, seems to dismiss the sound he heard for what it was -- a rat meeting its end at the claws of a cat. The curtain closes again. The needle is placed back on the phonograph. CU The BRIDE face in the dirt...One Mississippi...Two Mississippi...her eyes look up towards the trailer...All's clear...She begins crawling towards the trailer again. ...She's now right outside the trailer home...We can hear the sound of Budd sitting in a chair rocking back and forth. She hears the sound of a screw top unscrewed...The sound of pouring in a glass...The sound of a glass being laid heavy on a table. Crouched low on the balls of her feet, she, with great care, slowly and silently unsheathes her Hanzo sword. Through the bottom slit in the door, she sees the distorted image of Budd's feet on the floor. She slowly rises...removes her black stocking cap...blonde hair falls around her shoulders...sword in right hand...left hand grabs the front doorknob... QUICK as a Texas lizard on glass -- She brings the sword's handle down hard on the door lock -- EX CU Cheap Lock Busting. She flings the front door open... The BRIDE'S POV: Brother Budd sitting calmly in a rocking chair, moving back and forth to the Texas twang on his turntable, cradling a DOUBLE-BARREL SHOTGUN aimed right at The Bride. SERGIO LEONE CU: The Bride Blinks. Both barrels BLAST in our face. The BRIDE standing in the doorway is HIT SMACK DAB in the chest, and PROPELLED THROUGH the AIR BACKWARDS. Landing hard on her back in the dirt. Budd casually rises from his rocking chair and lifts the needle off the phonograph, cutting off the music. Then with shotgun in hand, stands in the doorway of the trailer looking down at The Bride. BUDD'S POV: The Bride laid out in the dirt below him -- Sword separated from her grasp -- Bloody mess down her front -- Groan from her throat. Budd steps down from the trailer onto the dirt, standing over The Bride.",

This could be the opening shot of a Texas zombie movie. We also see TWO MEN WITH SHOVELS (one which is Budd, the other which is ERNIE) digging up a grave. Budd's beat-to-shit pickup is in the shot too. Its headlight beams shining on the two men. And last but not least, The Bride, bound and gagged, lying in the flatbed of Budd's pickup. The BRIDE She begins to come to from the shot in her arm. Some dried blood lies caked around her wounds. Rope binds her wrists tightly together in front of her. A big leather cowboy belt is wrapped tight around her cherry brown cowboy boots. Her eyelids flutter open...and she sees stars. A giant, black Texas night sky full of them. She has no idea where she is. She turns her head to the left and sees, Back window and Cab of truck. She turns her head to the right and sees, Hatch Gate to flatbed. She listens...she hears, Crickets...The sound of Two Men Digging...One of the Men says something to the other in Spanish... THEN... She hears one of the Shovels HIT something buried... The Two Men speak to each other in Unsubtitled Spanish... THEN... We hear them Lifting something heavy, we might assume is a coffin. The Bride however knows not what to think. BOOM...They set it down. She hears boots approaching the flatbed, The crunching of leaves leading in her direction... TILL... With a CLANG and a SCRAPE the latches on the Gate of the flatbed are Yanked Out, and it lowers open with a CRASH. Revealing Budd, looking down on her.",

Was it the intention of the Shaolin monk to insult Pai Mei? Or, did he just fail to see the generous social gesture? The motives of the monk, remain, unknown. What is known, were the consequences. The next morning Pai Mei appeared at the Shaolin Temple, and demanded that the temple's head Abbot offer Pai Mei his neck, to repay the insult. The Abbot, at first, tried to console Pai Mei, only to find, Pai Mei was inconsolable.

We can hear the soft beat of her heart inside the pine box. Her composure is back. Taking the flashlight, she Shines the beam on the lid above her....Along the line of the coffin's rim and the lid where many nails meet....Then down to her Red Cowboy Boots, bound by a leather belt around her. Raising her knees, as much as the coffin will allow, and wiggling her feet, she slips her bare feet our of the boots and the belt's binding...Then, using her bare feet, then her bound-at-the-wrist hands, to pass one of the boots up to her...When the red boot is in her grasp, she turns it upside down....The STRAIGHT RAZOR falls out. Opening the razor, she slices through the ropes that tie her wrists, till both hands are free. She positions the flashlight so its Beam Shines on the coffin lid. The lid's about an inch and a half from the tip of her nose, about three inches from her hand. THEN... AS COMBAT DRUMS BEGIN TO BEAT ON THE SOUNDTRACK, she begins to concentrate. Her eyes focus on the wood above her, her left hand reaches out, touches the pine, passing her energy to it... ...Her long, white fingers, ball up into a FIST.... ...and that FIST begins STRIKING the coffin lid above her. With each Strike she lets out a KARATE SCREAM... AGAIN... And AGAIN... Her FIST SMASHES into the wood, leaving BLOOD on the lid... AGAIN... And AGAIN... A crack in the lid... AGAIN... Dirt begins to sift through the cracks onto the Bride... AGAIN... More dirt... AGAIN... Even more dirt... AGAIN... THE LID SMASHES and dirt pours into the coffin like water... THEN... Through six feet of dirt, we watch, the Bride - DIG - CLIMB - SWIM - SPROUT - BURROW - trough the earth like a sprouting plant and a burrowing mole combined, clawing for surface air. EXT. PAULA SCHULTZ'S GRAVE - NIGHT A SHOT straight out of an Italian horror film. We see the tombstone of \"PAULA SCHULTZ,\" and the mound of dirt over her grave. WHEN... The Bride's hand breaks the surface...then like one of Fulci's Zombies, Claws, Digs, and Pulls herself from mother earth's womb. Once extracted from her (almost) final resting place, she rolls over on her back, exhausted. She drinks in the night's air as if it were gulps of water. DIRT is in, on, and under every crack, crevice, and wrinkle on her body. SHE looks like a beautiful sculpture, made out of dirt. INT. DINER - NIGHT A Texas diner across the street from the graveyard. A YOUNG SODA JERK stands behind the counter, waiting for a customer, when he sees something approaching through the restaurant's big picture window that makes him look twice. SODA JERK'S POV: Through the picture window, we see the Bride, emerge from the Texas night, and walk towards the diner looking for all the world like a six-foot tall female version of the Peanuts character \"PIG PEN.\" With each of her footfalls, a smaller mushroom cloud of dust comes off her. The dirty blonde, walks into the diner, sits on a stool at the counter directly across from the Soda Jerk, and says;",

The two blonde warriors....swords in position...no longer circle each other....but instead move forward...closer and closer to each other....one baby step at a time... CU OF GIRLS. EX CU'S OF: Their separate GRIPS on the SWORD'S HANDLE. Their FEET moving closer. The Bride's eye. Elle's eye. The Tips of each other's Blade. Their Blonde Hair. As the Operatic Spaghetti Western Music Builds to a crescendo...we CUT BACK AND FORTH between CU's of the two women that get TIGHTER AND TIGHTER as we ZOOM in CLOSER and CLOSER....UNTIL...We reach the THEME'S CLIMAX.... Both women let loose with a    Samurai Grunt and Swing. EX CU: TWO SILVER BLADES CLASH. EX CU: BLONDE HAIR WHIPPING. EX CU: TWO SILVER BLADES CLASH AGAIN. TWO SHOT: The TWO WOMEN WARRIORS stand their ground, STRIKING and DEFENDING...When they stop, no one's been touched. The TWO WOMEN - Swords in attack position - stare across to the other one, as they prepare for their next attack... Now they begin to circle again. CU THEIR FEET making a circular walk. They ATTACK... EX CU BLADES MEET -- However this time we don't know who's on the left or the right. One Blade maneuvers around the other. EX EX CU: of TIP OF BLADE SLICING OPEN SKIN, about a quarter of an inch. It looks like a scalpel cut. No blood. Just skin separating. We don't know who's cut. The TWO WOMEN stand and face each other. Neither knows if it's them who has been struck. Neither woman bleeds. We feel a count of...One Mississippi... EX CU: ONE SILVER BLADE, clean as a whistle. EX CU: ONE SILVER BLADE with a smudge of CRIMSON BLOOD on its TIP. We feel a count of Two Mississippi... ELLE, BLOOD begins to PROJECTILE SPRAY out of a slice in Elle's neck only a quarter of an inch long. The Blood does not exit the neck as liquid but as a FINE RED MIST, like that of an aerosol can, we even HEAR the slight SPRAY WHISTLE. Elle feels nothing. She turns her eyes towards the sound of the spray, and sees the blood escaping her like air from a balloon. She lifts her hand and places it in the path of the spray, it's immediately BATHED IN RED. Elle drops the Bride's sword. As her blood continues to escape, both women look across each other. The effect is that Elle Driver is a balloon and her life is escaping before both their very eyes. And now looking across at each other, the two women see the other for the first time, not as adversaries, or opponents, or as rivals, or as bitches...but as sisters. Elle no longer has enough life in her to stand up...She falls to her knees in front of The Bride.... ...then as she dies, she leans the side of her head against The Bride's standing body. Her blood runs down The Bride's leg. As she passes on, Elle gently wraps her arms around the Bride's leg. The Bride's hands go down to Elle's long blonde hair, and begins gently stroking it, easing her pain as she expires. Only in death do they find the sisterhood that could have been theirs. WIDE SHOT The Bride standing, Elle on her knees, the desert surrounds them. The BRIDE putting a shovel down. WIDE SHOT The Bride has finished burying Elle. She sticks a jerry rigged wood cross in the ground as a marker. Then using her sog; WOODEN CROSS carves the name \"L. DRIVER\" on the cross. Then drives away in the big red pickup.
