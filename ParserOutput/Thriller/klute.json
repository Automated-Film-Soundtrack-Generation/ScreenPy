STAIRWELL OF BROWNSTONE - NIGHT We watch Bree as she mounts to the top floor, the door of her apartment, barren, isolated, frightened. INT. BREE'S APTARTMENT - NIGHT BREE unlocks the door, switches on a light, cases the apartment for a moment before entering, securing chain-lock, putting aside her things. There is a RECORD PLAYER near the first interior doorway. She switches it as she moves by. By time the first record has dropped, she has the shower turned on, is getting rid of her dress.

It is a late night gathering place of many who belong to the sexual underworld of the city. BREE and the OTHER GIRL advance to a pew. A MAN sitting there (the other girl's pimp) with a THIRD GIRL. BREE's companion greet him shyly, tenderly: she and BREE sit down, join in conversation. PULL BACK SLOWLY -- other pews, other girls and a few men, the sisterhood -- To -- BAR AREA IN BACK (WHAT ONCE MUST HAVE BEEN THE VESTIBULE OF THE CRURCH) Among the people around the bar, pimps, whores, and a sprinkling of hopeful Johns and curiosity seekers. The camera picks a familiar face: CABLE. He watches BREE with a mixture of amusement and contempt. A GIRL comes over to him and tries to proposition him. They appear to be discussing price. Just as she thinks it is set, he walks away. INT. KLUTE'S APARTMENT - NIGHT CLOSEUP photograph of TOM GRUNEMANN pinned to a large piece of beaverboard KLUTE has placed on a wall. CAMERA PANS over various pictures and pieces of evidence KLUTE has pinned up in an attempt to make some sense from the puzzle of TOM GRUNMIANN's disappearance. CAMERA PANS over to KLUTE sitting on cot looking up at the pieces of the puzzle. There is a heated TV dinner in front of him. The TAPE RECORDER reels start turning (sound powered), the recording light starts winding (as BREE, above, dials). KLUTE pays it scant attention - he can catch up with the news anytime. He sits manfully in front of the TV dinner, starts peeling back the foil -- INT. BREE'S APARTMENT: BREE - NIGHT She holds the phone, is answered.

He reaches for the headset of the taperecorder, holds it loosely against one ear. He exhibits a measure of new interest. The TAPE RECORDER stops running. He immediately rewinds, and starts listening through it again. We CUT TO -- EXT. GARMENT DISTRICT - NIGHT Large, dark buildings -- a DIM-LIGHTED WINDOW showing at an upper floor of one -- the street otherwise by and large deserted. A TAXI draws in, a FIGURE IN EVENING DRESS (Bree) gets out, approaches the building, glances around, either secretly or apprehensively -- presses a buzzer, waits, gets answering CLICKS, enters the dark hallway of the building, starts upstairs.

Klute gives chase -- over ridges, past water tanks, oddments of roof furniture -- EXT. SEVERAL ROOFTOPS BEYOND - NIGHT The FIGURE races to a roof door disappearing into abandoned building. INT. STAIRWELL - ABANDONED BUILDING CAMERA follows KLUTE as he cautiously makes his way down the stairwell of the boarded up old brownstone. He gets to the first floor. He can see no exit in the building. He opens door that leads to a narrow staircase into the cellar. INT. CELLAR - ABANDONED BROWNSTONE It is as black as a dungeon and as low. He lights a match, but sees no one. There is a sound of movement coming from the floor above, He runs up the steps to the floor above and sees a very faint light coming through one of the closed apartment doors. Carefully takes out a gun and then with one quick movement he breaks through the door. INT. ABANDONED APARTMENT The walls, ceiling, floors are entirely covered with crudely painted psychedelic signs and sayings. The room is lighted by some candies stuck in bottles. Sitting on a blanket on the floor are several teenaged boys and girls having a pot party. They have obviously made a clubhouse for themselves in the abandoned house. It is a MOOT POINT whether they or KLUTE is more stunned at the sight that faces them. He puts his gun away in embarrassment. Again he has been made to feel like an awkward peeping tom in this hidden world of the city. INT. CELLAR - ABANDONED BUILDING CAMERA wanders restlessly through the blackness and stops at a pinpoint of light coming through a low door. CAMERA goes through opening into long narrow furnace room with the ceiling so low that an ordinary man could not stand up. We hear the sound of breathing. CAMERA follows the sound through the darkness revealing a sweaty man huddled in the corner looking like some strange animal from a painting by Bosch. It is Cable. INT. BREE'S APARTMENT - NIGHT Bree has wrapped herself in the quilt -- standing up against a corner shivering, immobilized. We hear KLUTE'S FOOTSTEPS DESCENDING -- she flinches -- he enters.",

This night spot is totally black except for a series of huge slide projections on the wall in back of the tables. The slides, which change every few seconds are elegant representations of the beautiful people living the good life as seen in such magazines as VOGUE, TOWN & COUNTRY & HARPERS BAZAAR. The customers sitting in the darkness below provide a direct contrast to the pictures in back. The silhouette figures of BREE & KLUTE stop at a table seating three people, two call girls and a pimp.

SUBWAY TRAIN: REFLECTION IN WINDOW OF BREE AND KLUTE SITTING SIDE BY SIDE CAMERA moves in closer so we only see reflection of BREE looking at herself and at the world seeming to speed by at an inhuman pace as the lights of the tunnel zoom past her face. What she sees is the figure of a woman with life screaming past her out of control. INT. SUBWAY SUBWAY slows to a stop and a door opens. BREE sits with KLUTE staring at the open door and then without warning - gets up and runs off the train. The door closes, leaving KLUTE locked in the train. SUBWAY EXIT SHOT of BREE's feet rushing up the stairs in darkness and then quick cut to her face as she hits the sunlight. She pauses for a moment - relieved to be out of the darkness. EXT. ROOFTOP OF BREE'S BROWNSTONE - NIGHT CAMERA pans from night view of New York City to KLUTE sitting on the rooftop alone as if trying to comprehend all he has seen, the mystery of TOM GRUNEMANN's disappearance in this world and the mysteries of the behavior of BREE. SKYLIGHT INTO BREE'S APARTMENT - NIGHT Alongside of him the skylight of BREE's apartment lights up. He looks through the skylight and sees BREE enter her apartment. He can hear BREE talking to somebody, and then he sees that she is talking to FRANK LIGOURIN. KLUTE watches through the skylight and hears bits and pieces of the scene between BREE and FRANK. He sees the same kind of symbiosis, the same kind of parody of loving that he saw between ARLYN & BERGER. As the scene becomes more intimate he leaves. INT. CABLE'S (CITY) OFFICE: ON KLUTE - DAY The pristine, antiseptic, elegance off CABLE'S office is in its own way as unreal and dehumanized as the sexual underworld KLUTE has been exploring with BREE, and KLUTE looks as out of place in the one as he does in the other. TRASK sits beside KLUTE facing CABLE who is impeccably dressed. He is the total image of the executive in control.",

Lieutenant, thank you. KLUTE and TRASK depart. CABLE closes the door and returns to his desk. He pulls out a tape recorder from a drawer in his desk, rewinds it and turns it on. We hear a playback of the previous scene with KLUTE and TRASK. He stands at the window listening with some satisfaction; as if listening to what KLUTE revealed keeps him in control of the situation. EXT. WINDOW - CABLE'S OFFICE - DAY The CAMERA pulls back from a CU of CABLE standing at the window to a wide angle looking at CABLE through the window. The window is 30 or 40 stories high. The wide angle lens almost makes the building look like it is standing on point, and CABLE, a man suspended in space. EXT. WIDE SHOT: DOCKS - DAY A TUGBOAT has pulled in. The SOUND of its heavy ENGINES, IDLING, runs underneath this entire sequence. A POLICE VEHICLE or two has parked at the head of the dock. We see several figures on the rear deck of the tug, but it's not clear at this distance what they're doing. The POLICE CAR WITH KLUTE arrives. He dismounts and proceeds from dock to tug-deck. EXT. TUGBOAT DECK: GROUP - DAY TRASK glances toward Klute as he arrives, but doesn't greet him. His attention, like the others, is directed downward and off-scene (to the surface of the water actually, just outboard of the tug). We see beside Trask TWO Uniformed Cops (SUGARMAN and SPENCE) and DECKHANDS. And we hear, along with the throbbing of the engines, a stirring about of the water and a peculiar third noise -- rather commingled with the engines -- which we can't at first identify. Klute joins the group, watches. SPENCE brings into view, and shakes out, a giant neoprene body bag. INSTRUCTIONS among the group AD LIB, UNDER -- TRASK (toward Klute) They were bringing a freighter down through Kill Van Kull; propellers washed it up on top. SUGARMAN brings into view a METAL BASKET attached with short ropes. He complains -- SUGARMAN Why didn't you bring it up on deck?",

Groups of cheerful tourists are admiring the civilized monuments to man's search for culture. CAMERA pans to ugly street across the way revealing Klute approaching and entering a dingy warehouse topped by an absurdly placed copy of the Statue of Liberty. This is the municipal storehouse. INT. MUNICIPAL STOREHOUSE - DAY The abrupt cut from the bright sunlight leaves us in almost total darkness as we follow KLUTE. We are in a huge storeroom. As we grow accustomed to the darkness we see bits and pieces of incongruous objects scattered along Klute's path - old pieces of furniture, lamps, piggy banks, etc. - the remnants of the lives of the plundered, the destroyed and the dispossessed. Some is stolen property, some evidence for homicide cases, and some the unclaimed possessions of the unclaimed dead. A CUSTODIAN -- an ancient retainer sort, a civil servant, leads KLUTE into an old elevator cage. INT. ELEVATOR Klute and Custodian as elevator ascends; looking up the elevator shaft through the open cage we see a series of doors hanging over space seeming to lead nowhere. The whole sequence has the feeling of a dream of being lost in a black limbo. Klute and Custodian leave elevator on higher floor and walk down the long very low corridor past rows of locked vault doors. The Custodian stops at one and opens it. We are in a small dungeon-like room filled with banks of files from floor to ceiling. The Custodian counts to himself -- CUSTODIAN",
