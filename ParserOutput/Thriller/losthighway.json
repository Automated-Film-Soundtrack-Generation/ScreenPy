The camera comes slowly down at him from the ceiling, like a weight pressing on his head.  Fred's pain is demonstrably overwhelming him now.  He moans and rolls from side to side in the dimness, making grotesque, otherworldly sounds.  As the camera moves into a CLOSE UP, the last image of Fred's head shows the discolored swelling has increased.  Fred looks up, sensing something. CUT TO: EXT. THE MADIS0N HOUSE - NIGHT There is a \"For Sale\" sign posted in front.  The camera pans slowly as in the videotape across the front of the house. The interior of the house is dark, but fleetingly we are aware of movement, shadows inside. CUT TO: INT. ANDY'S HOUSE - NIGHT Marian and Raquel are in the living room, attired in the undergarments they purchased at the lingerie store.  HOT MUSIC is BLARING from a stereo.  Marian and Raquel are dancing, as sexy and wild as it is possible for them to be. Andy is lying on his back on the rug, dressed only in undershorts and socks, the girls stomping feet stepping furiously around his head and body.  His eyes are closed at first, but when he opens them, he sees their feet in a blur. He tries to get up, but he is too strung out, and he collapses again.  Marian and Raquel take him by his hands and feet and begin pulling him around the room as they dance. Andy is blitzed, smiling moronically.  The girls' breasts tumble out of their teddies.  Raquel drops her end of Andy, turns up the music even louder, and dances into a frenzy. Marian drops to her knees, Andy's feet on either side of her, shaking her shoulders and whipping her hair around.  Andy makes another attempt to sit up - he looks at Marian, reaches for her but falls back, dead to the world.  Raquel and Marian don't quit. CUT TO: INT. PRISON - FRED'S CELL - NIGHT Fred is still curled on the floor, but spasms begin to rock his body.  He goes into convulsions, blood gushes from his nostrils.  His head is badly swollen.  Fred vomits repeatedly, and drags around in his mess.  Fred turns, straining upwards as we've seen him do before.  His face and head are hideously deformed. Fred brings his shaking, tortured hand to his forehead.  He pulls his hand down across his face squeezing it as it goes. As his hand passes over his face, Fred's features are removed leaving a blank, white mass with eye sockets. We move into the eye sockets and beyond. DISSOLVE TO: EXT. TWO-LANE HIGHWAY - NIGHT We see a clean moving POV illuminated by headlights.  We are floating down an old two-lane highway through a desolate, desert landscape.  This gliding, eerie POV continues until the headlights illuminate a figure standing at the side of the road.  This figure is a man, PETE DAYTON.  Pete turns, unsettled, as he looks directly at us as we move closer to him.  The ghost image of a house appears behind Pete.  There is a girl, SHEILA, standing on the lawn in front of the house.  She is afraid and is trying to communicate with Pete. Pete doesn't seem to hear her and continues to stare directly at us.  Now Pete seems to move toward us as we move toward him.  His head fills the screen. DISSOLVE TO: INT. PRISON - FRED'S CELL - NIGHT Fred's blank face begins to contort and take on the appearance, feature by feature, of Pete Dayton. Fred Madison is becoming Pete Dayton. FADE OUT: FADE IN: EXT. PRISON - DAWN We watch the sun rise outside the prison, ascending over the strands of barbed-wire above the wall. CUT TO: INT. PRISON - DEATH ROW - MORNING A GUARD is making his early morning rounds.  He stops at each cell and looks in, making a mark with a pencil on a piece of paper on a clipboard. when he comes to Fred's cell, he is about to make a check-mark, but looks in again and appears confused.

Pete's reaction to these sounds is one of petrified confusion.  Underlying these sounds is a kind of unearthly, steady DRONE. Pete gets up off the bed, unsteadily.  He moves toward his bedroom door.  As he moves the amplified SOUNDS shift. He can hear laughter.  The laughter seems to be LOUD, but at the same time coming from people who are trying to contain the laughter - to hide it. Pete opens his door and peers out. Pete's POV down the hall toward the living room - his mother and father have stopped laughing and are turned with guilty smiles in his direction.  They are smoking a joint, passing it back and forth.  They are not looking directly at him. They seem to be looking, but not seeing. Pete's parents POV down the hall toward Pete's room.  There is no one there - just an empty hallway. Pete's parents continue to stare, but then turn away toward each other - they start to laugh quietly again.

At first we hear nothing, then the sound of Al's piss streaming into an empty coffee cup.  The camera stays on the top of Al's head until he has completed the last few spurts of his micturition.  Al's head comes up and he opens the passenger side door and dumps the urine into the street.  He closes the door and zips up his trousers. CUT TO: INT.

He slams his fist into the man's nose - almost snapping the man's neck in the process.  The man goes down bleeding. Pete attacks the other man who is turning toward him ready for a fight.

Pete stands and turns - pulsating with anger.  Sheila is there beside him.",

Suddenly, there are two knocks on the other side of the closed door.  The Slickster moves off the door and opens it a crack.  He talks quietly to someone Alice can't see, then he turns, opens the door and gestures for Alice to go through. Alice puts out her cigarette - her hand is shaking. She walks over past the Slickster and enters a much larger room.  There are about FIFTEEN MEN in the room - all leaning comfortably at different points on the walls.  There is only one chair in the room - Mr. Eddy is sitting in it. No one says anything to her, but one man nods his head and from this nod, Alice feels she should walk to the center of the room.  She does, and she instinctively turns to the man sitting in the chair. They all just stare at her silently.  She looks around nervously - her eyes return to Mr. Eddy's. Suddenly, a man steps quickly up to her - draws a pistol and cocks it against her head. Alice goes weak in the knees.  Her eyes fill with fear. The men continue to stare. Mr. Eddy gives Alice a small gesture as if to say \"well?\". Somehow she knows what they want, even though they haven't asked for it with words. Alice starts to undress - slowly - in as sexy a way as she knows how. The men just stare without expression. When she is completely naked, Mr. Eddy gestures her over to him.  Soon she is on her knees in front of him - making herself available for whatever he wants. Mr. Eddy's POV - Alice looks in his eyes.  She reaches her hand up to stroke his cheek...",

DEEP DELL PLACE - NIGHT We see a street sign saying \"Deep Dell Place\".  Pete walks up the street looking at numbers. He finds 2224 Deep Dell Place - Andy's House. He stares at the house from the sidewalk. Lights are on upstairs and down.  The hot wind moves big shadows of trees over the front of the house. Pete looks at his watch.  It reads: 11:05 p.m. He walks down the driveway, crosses through some bushes and comes to a fence separating the front yard from the back. He stops and listens.  He pulls himself up and over the fence, but crashes on something on the other side. He freezes - listening. He hears the wind blowing through the trees, and distant music from inside - a slow jazz piece. He hears echoing sounds of love making. He makes his way around back - goes up the stairs and tries the back door.  It opens. CUT TO: INT. ANDY'S HOUSE - NIGHT Pete sneaks through the kitchen and comes into the living room.  Pete stops short and stares.  A movie projector is running in the living room.  A porno film is being projected on a huge screen at the far end.  Alice is in the porno film. A man is fucking her from behind - with LOUD SLAPPING SOUNDS of flesh banging flesh.  Her face is in the foreground.  Her eyes look out directly at Pete.  She is loving every minute of it.  Inside Pete, jealousy starts to rage out of control. He looks around.  He sees clothes scattered about.  He picks up a girl's sweater and smells it.  He looks up the stairs. Feet appear at the top of the stairs.  They start down. Pete runs for the bar. Along the way, he grabs a heavy, bronze figurine of a well- stacked woman off a rectangular glass-topped coffee table, and ducks behind the bar. He can hear Andy approaching.  He can hear Andy gather two glasses.  He can hear Alice being fucked harder in the porno film.  He clenches his teeth with rage. Suddenly, Andy moves right in front of him.  They see each other.  Andy's eyes widen - Pete leaps up, and thwacks the bronze figurine down on the top of Andy's head.  Andy falls. The breasts of the figurine have made two bloody holes in his forehead. Pete turns. Alice is coming quickly down the stairway - naked, except for a pair of panties.  Lipstick is smeared around her mouth. She is carrying a half-filled pillowcase.  Her porno film is playing on the wall behind her. These images jump and spin in Pete's mind.  He moves unsteadily toward her.",

Renee leaves the room, closing the door as quietly as possible behind her. As the door CLICKS, Mr. Eddy/Laurent wakes up.  He sits up and gets a pack of cigarettes from the bedside table, shakes one out, lights it with a book of \"Lost Highway Hotel\" matches, and smokes it while seated on the edge of the bed. CUT TO: INT. LOST HIGHWAY HOTEL - ROOM 25 - PRE-DAWN Fred, still fully dressed, is waking up, AS IF IN A TRANCE - the same attitude he had on the videotape.  He strains upwards and looks eerily around the room.  He gets up and crosses slowly to a window.  He takes the edge of the window curtain and pulls it back. The view is of the gravel parking lot of the hotel. Fred's POV: He sees Renee, down below, walk over to a car, get in and drive away. Fred walks back to his bed, picks up his revolver from under the pillow, crosses the room to the door and walks out. CUT TO: INT.

Still watching out the window, the camera sees Fred knock Mr. Eddy/Laurent over the head with the gun butt and put him into the trunk of a car.  Fred slams the trunk lid and climbs into the driver's side of what is obviously Mr. Eddy/Laurent's car - the Mercedes 600 Pullman. As Fred drives away, a HAND appears in our window foreground.
