Greek Mythology. Bishop reaches forward, types \"Nemesis.\" Hits ENTER. A moment... and then our minds are blown. The entire wall of the room in front of Bishop glows to life. It's a one large high-resolution monitor. On it, glows an infinitely detailed work-up on Bishop. A photograph on him glows at the center of the screen, changing every three or four seconds to another. This is Bishop's method, brought into the 21st century. Accounts, Medical charts, psych profile, associates, residence... Bishop approaches... takes it in. Touches \"Accounts\" and the window SPREADS OUT across the whole wall. Multiple windows, all of Bishop's money, displayed in real time, the numbers subtly changing with the flow of foreign markets. Another window above is labeled \"Associates.\" Bishop touches this one and the financial windows are replaced with a collage of FACES. Not too many. We recognize the Store Owner and his Daughter. Steve himself. An older man \"Gerald Bishop,\" Bishop's father. And a photo of the Woman. Bishop touches the woman and multiple images propagate out from the single. Many stills, but several are in motion, looping: Childhood movies. A commercial done as a teen. A blue movie when she was 20. Bishop's eyes settle on a video image: He and the woman, caught just an hour ago in the middle of the dancing party. The woman leaning to him, kissing him. Bishop stares at the image, then touches another image labeled \"Residence.\" INSTANTLY, the images are replaced with images of the interior and exterior of Bishop's home. Bishop stares at them, confused. SQUINTS... realizing that in one of the images, the trees lightly sway in the breeze.",
