We are a world away from the Hollywood cliches of neatly laid out, immaculate cadavers. Here, some of the corpses have reached a state of advanced decomposition and others are still frozen in contorted positions, expressing their ultimate agony before dying. From the homeless man fished out of the river, to the woman killed by gun shots, each corpse tells his own story... Amidst the group of doctors 35-year-old AMY, deeply immersed in an autopsy, is interrupted by her cell phone. Amy checks the display for the incoming call- BEN. She hesitates for a moment and doesn't answer the call. Amy goes back to the postmortem analysis on her tape recorder. 11   EXT.

DAY - MAYFLOWER DEPARTMENT STORE                          13 On 38th Street, just off of Broadway, the Mayflower has withstood the passage of time and the huge fire that forced it to shut down- The damage from the fire is still noticeable on the facade of the building- The fire appears to have started on the ground floor and seems to have spread all the way up to the top. Some of the windows are shattered, while others are boarded up. What was once an impressive ornate building, a fine example of 1920's architecture standing on one of Manhattan's most dynamic streets, now gives off a feeling of devastation and desolation. What is left of it is a mere ruin, a sort of neglected ghost ship, abandoned in the heart of the city.",

He stops for a moment, facing his reflection in the mirror. He fixes his collar and looks at himself in his new clothes- Not quite an NYPD uniform... Suddenly, his eyes freeze. Intrigued, he comes closer to the mirror and leans forward- A HANDPRINT, BARELY VISIBLE, ON THE ICE COLD SURFACE. He touches it with the tip of his fingers and tries to rub it off, unsuccessfully. He picks up a rag from the ground, spits on the mirror, and rubs the mark fervently. The print remains. This confirms his hunch- THE HANDPRINT IS INSIDE THE MIRROR... By angling the flashlight, another handprint is revealed. Another. And yet another- THE ENTIRE MIRROR IS COVERED WITH HANDPRINTS, JUST AS IF A CROWD OF PEOPLE ON THE OTHER SIDE HAD PRESSED ITSELF AGAINST THE GLASS TO GET OUT... As he looks back up in the mirror he sees- THE ACCESS DOOR TO THE BASEMENT OPENING... Ben turns around. His gaze freezes- THE ACCESS DOOR TO THE BASEMENT IS CLOSED! YET, IN THE MIRROR, IT CONTINUES TO SLOWLY SCREECH OPEN! Ben swings his head back and forth, between the shut door in reality and the opened door in the mirror. What is happening? Is he dreaming or hallucinating? Ben walks backwards towards the basement door, keeping his eyes fixed on the mirror. As he goes to reach for the handle, he sees his reflection reaching for the handle of an invisible door! Ben opens it- THE SYNCHRONICITY BETWEEN THE REAL WORLD AND THE ONE REFLECTED IN THE MIRROR HAS BEEN RESTORED. Ben tries to reenact the phenomenon. He opens and closes the door over and over, while observing his reflection, but the mirror is no longer deceitful. The staircase leading to the basement vanishes into the dark. Ben hesitates. 16. 24    OMITTED                                                         24 25    OMITTED                                                         25 26    OMITTED                                                         26 27    OMITTED                                                         27 28    OMITTED                                                         28 29    OMITTED                                                         29 30    OMITTED                                                         30 31    OMITTED                                                         31 31A   OMITTED                                                         31A 32    OMITTED                                                         32 33    OMITTED                                                         33 34    OMITTED                                                         34 35    OMITTED                                                         35 36    INT.

He finds some instant coffee next to the bottle of Jack Daniels. He briefly hesitates between the coffee and the whisky... He grabs a cup and pours the boiling water into the instant coffee. In the reflection of the clock, we see Ben watching TV. It is past midnight. Ben gets up and grabs his flashlight- It's time for his rounds. 45   INT. NIGHT - MAYFLOWER CENTRAL HALL                            45 Through the shattered panes of the central dome, we see Ben walking through the store. Since the mysterious occurrences of the night before, his attitude has changed. He avoids, as much as possible, looking into the mirrors. He is on guard, fearing another supernatural manifestation. The shadows, the mannequins, and the shapes in the mirrors are all disturbing and unsettling. Even what remains of the sculptures on the top of the marble columns seems alive in the dark. As he crosses the entrance hall, a glint of light catches his attention. Despite himself, he stops and gazes into the mirror- AT THE FAR END OF THE STORE, ONE OF THE DEPARTMENTS IS IN FULL SWING AND BATHED IN DAYLIGHT! EVERYTHING IS SPOTLESS, AS IF THE FIRE HAD NEVER TAKEN PLACE. CUSTOMERS COME AND GO AS IF NOTHING HAPPENED. How is this possible? Ben turns around to see the same spot in the real world- ONLY IT'S IN RUINS... Ben glances back at the reflection in the mirror- The vision of the past prevails. Unable to ignore it, Ben decides to check it out for himself... Ben wanders off towards the far end of the store, a landscape of dust and desolation. HIS REFLECTION IN THE MIRROR, ON THE OTHER HAND, HEADS IN THE DIRECTION OF THE \"FLASHBACK\"- We follow him in the mirror- Ben has left the night behind and enters the \"daytime\" department. Everything is in perfect order and unspoiled. Ben continues his journey into the past.

Women fight over articles of clothing. Ben stops dead in his tracks when he notices, around his shoes, a transparent liquid spilling out on the floor- He bends down and dips his fingertips into the liquid- GASOLINE. Gallons of flowing gasoline gradually spreading over the floor of the department store. Ben turns around and sees, under the shelving, A HAND LIGHTING A ZIPPO- The lighter falls to the floor in slow motion. The liquid bursts into flame instantly. THE CHEERFUL VISION OF A DAY IN THE DEPARTMENT STORE QUICKLY TURNS INTO A NIGHTMARE- EVERYTHING IS ENGULFED IN FLAMES. THE CLOTHES, THE MANNEQUINS AND LAST BUT NOT LEAST, THE CROWD! THE AGONIZING SHRIEKS OF PAIN AND PANIC ARE DEAFENING. Frightened, Ben steps back- The flames spread quickly to the escalators where the crowd has rushed to escape death-",

The leather is worn-out but the absence of dust establishes that the wallet has landed there recently. Ben examines the object with the experienced touch of a professional accustomed to handling evidence. Between the collection of cards and scraps of paper, Ben finds a driver's license belonging to- GARY LEWIS, 55 years old, a sturdily built African American man.

A name is embroidered on the shoulder- AGAIN THE SAME NAME: GARY LEWIS, BEN'S PREDECESSOR, THE MISSING NIGHT WATCHMAN. The wallet rests on the table and piques Ben's curiosity. He cannot hold back his police instincts. He finally empties out the contents on the table- A Blockbuster card, restaurant receipts, a driver's license, Phillips' business card from Mayflower, cash and a sheet of paper folded in four- Ben unfolds the sheet of paper and sees, written in ink- ESSEKER Ben chews over these seven letters. Is it somebody's name? A place? A code? Initials? He folds it up again and puts everything back, neatly, in the wallet that he stows away in one of the drawers.

Ben stares at himself in the mirror, behind the bottle display shelves. It is not his mirror image that he is observing.

In the basement, the water level continues to rise. With a flashlight in hand, and his feet submerged in the water, Ben moves deeper into the tunnel. He is searching for the source of the leak. The beam of light sweeps across the walls and the piping. Ben crosses an intersection. In the corner, on the tiled wall, he barely discerns an old inscription ingrained with decades of dust and dirt. He sinks his hand into the water and wipes it off, revealing an arrow pointing to, ST JOHN'S DEPARTMENT OF PSYCHIATRY. He continues his exploration of the subterranean passageways. Suddenly, he notices a darker area on the wall. He comes closer and discovers a brownish damp-spot, covered with mold. The humidity has pearled into droplets. He has found the source of the leak. His hand brushes the wall, causing it to crumble instantly. Ben digs into the plaster as if it were butter, bringing a cracked water pipe to light. The leakage has damaged the wall in which the tubing was embedded. Ben hears the echoing sound of streaming water, as if there were another room on the other side of the wall. He pushes against the saturated wall, and pierces through it with his arm. He removes his arm. For a moment, he observes the gaping black hole that he has just left behind. Ben peeks through the hole with his flashlight, but he cannot make out what is on the other side. He makes the hole bigger, until the passage is large enough for him to crawl through- ON THE OTHER SIDE, HE DISCOVERS A LARGE BRICK ROOM AND IN THE MIDDLE OF IT ANOTHER ROOM- AN OCTAGONAL ONE WHOSE EACH AND EVERY WALL, INCLUDING THE CEILING, IS MADE OF GIGANTIC TWO WAYS MIRRORS. One of the mirrors is opened, ajar- It's a door. He enters.

Ben moves towards the center of the room- ALTHOUGH THE ROOM SEEMED EMPTY BEFORE, SOMEBODY IS NOW STANDING IN THE CORNER. It's a well-built man. He too is wearing the blue security guard's uniform. From where he stands, Ben can only see the back of the man's head. As he moves in closer, he can make out the name embroidered on the man's shoulder- IT'S GARY LEWIS, THE FORMER NIGHT WATCHMAN!",

IN THE MIRROR, HER EVIL DOUBLE CONTINUES TO PULL OPEN ITS MOUTH, SUDDENLY RIPPING ITS JAW OFF WITH THE SOUND OF CRACKING BONES AND CARTILAGE- AT THE SAME INSTANT, IN THE BATHTUB, ANGELA HAS NO TIME TO REACT BEFORE SHE UNDERGOES THE SAME AGONIZING TORTURE! The mirror cracks by itself. The bathtub overflows with red water spilling out on the white tiled bathroom floor. FADE TO BLACK 66   INT. DAY -   APARTMENT QUEENS - THE NEXT MORNING                   66 The camera flashes illuminate the crime scene. Angela's body lies afloat in the bathtub. The apartment is entirely flooded. Two men in police uniforms close off a security zone, to keep the intrusive neighbors away. A detective is interrogating an old Puerto Rican couple- the downstairs neighbors. They were the ones who alerted the police, after having noticed the water leakage. The old woman explains how \"it was raining blood into her living room\"... Amongst the police officers and the legal medical squad, we find Larry. He is in charge of the case. Leaning over the bathtub, Larry examines the visible parts of the corpse. Angela's face is concealed by her own long black hair, floating in the murky water. Larry slips on an examination glove, pulls up his sleeve and sinks his arm into the blood-red bath. He feels around for the chain of the plug in order to drain the bathtub. The water level begins to recede, gradually revealing Angela's naked corpse. With the tip of his fingers, Larry lifts away the few strands of hair covering Angela's face- (CONTINUED) 48. 66   CONTINUED:                                                      66 Taken by surprise, he steps back from the horrifying sight of this JAW-LESS FACE. Larry removes his glove, wipes off his bloodied arm and starts to leave the bathroom when something else catches his attention- He comes closer to the spiderweb cracked medicine cabinet mirror. A TINY DROP OF BLOOD is dripping from one of the cracks. Strange. A DARK SILHOUETTE PASSES BEHIND HIM IN THE REFLECTION. He turns immediately- The bloodied bathroom is still and silent. Angela's destroyed body lies in the empty bathtub. A police inspector in the next room, calls out to him-",

He glances back at the rear view mirror and sees ANGELA'S CORPSE, SITTING ON THE BACK SEAT! Startled, he loses control of the vehicle. A truck approaches at full speed in the opposite lane. He barely avoids the collision. Two other cars appear. Ben zigzags in and out, just barely avoiding a fatal crash. He stops along the edge of the road. Ben closes his eyes and rests his head against the steering wheel in an attempt to clear his mind. He looks up into the rear- view mirror again- ANGELA'S REFLECTION IS STILL THERE. Behind her long black hair, she fixes him with a milky gaze. Ben flies into a rage. HE SMASHES THE REAR-VIEW MIRROR WITH HIS BARE FIST, REDUCING IT TO SCRAPS... Ben is alone and lost.",

He turns the lamp back at the file and sits down to study it. WHY ARE THE MIRRORS ASKING FOR ANNA IF SHE'S ALREADY DEAD? WHY? IT DOESN'T MAKE ANY SENSE... On an index card filled in by Anna's parents in September 1952, Ben finds a Pennsylvania home address.

His eye lands on several photographs of Anna taken at the time she was admitted to the hospital- She is just a child, yet, six male nurses were needed to restrain and immobilize her in front of the photographer. Her face is hardly discernible as she struggles like a wild animal. A high-pitched sound of cracking glass is heard from behind. Ben turns around- Another loud crack - It comes from one of the covered mirrors in the apartment. Ben rises slowly to his feet and comes closer. He removes the sheet hanging on the frame- A crack has appeared in the upper corner of the mirror. Ben casts his eyes over the reflection. His glance comes to rest on Anna's file laying on the desk- He goes to fetch the photograph of the little girl and presents it to the mirror- KRAAAAACK - the crack in the mirror spreads, as if some kind of pressure were applied on the other side of the mirror as a reaction to the photograph...",

Ben smashes into the wall separating the mirror room from the underground passageways. On the other side, he lands on the ground, in the dark. He strives to regain consciousness...

She lifts Ben up and throws him across the room. He rams into the wall. With the absence of light in the basement, Ben is defenseless. He cannot see his assailant... Ben is caught by the leg and dragged backwards. His hand struggles to catch on to anything that could hold him back. Suddenly, under the water, his hand lands on the gun.
