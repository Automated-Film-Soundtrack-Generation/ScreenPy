The two Detectives are leaving the Living Room and entering the HALL toward the bedrooms. The ceiling is low here and it feels very claustrophobic. Ahead is a Door painted red. But before they get to it, there's a Room on the right. Snyder shines his light in. It's a BATHROOM. The shower curtain is open. Nobody in the tub. The Door ahead is waiting, but there's another Door on the right. Snyder shines his light in. This one is a Treatment Room with a Therapy table and shelves of oils and unguents. They've come to the red Door. Atwood will open this one. She turns the knob and pushes. The Door is stuck. She and Snyder exchange a look. Snyder shuffles back half a step and flattens himself against the wall. He shuts off his flashlight. Atwood takes a deep breath, levers her weight against the door and pushes. There's a sudden Snap! Then the door swings freely open. The beam of Atwood's flashlight reveals a large room containing a bed, a dresser, a... CREEEKKK!!! The sound is coming from up in the rafters. Atwood whips her flashlight in that direction. For an instant the beam catches a piece of a large shape falling fast right at her. (CONTINUED)",
