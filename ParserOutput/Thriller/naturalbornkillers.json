He has a thick and wide leather belt around his waist with a metal ring built into each side. Long sturdy chains with handcuffs on each end are wrapped across his body and through the rings, binding his arms to his sides. His hands and feet are double cuffed. The Deputies both have their guns drawn, ready to blow Mickey in half at the slightest provocation. For a man wrapped and bound in chains, Mickey seems strangely in control of his environment. Even restrained as he is by the symbols of society (the chains, jail, guards, guns, jump-suit), he remains a dangerous, intimidating, and fascinating figure. Wayne takes in the image of Mickey.",

And I'm tellin' ya, Mickey, he looks bad. The two psychologists they used for their psychiatric kangaroo court won't talk to us, which always looks bad. I have an interview with both the judge of your trial, Bert Steinsma, and the psychologist and author, Emil Reinghold, both of which discount the notion that you're insane. You put that all together, and what the state is doing becomes obvious. But the network isn't satisfied. They feel the show needs another element. It needs you. In order to put the show on the air, I need to get an interview with you. You haven't talked to the press since your trial. Now, a few days before you get transferred to an asylum, you grant an interview on television with Wayne Gayle. We're talkin' a media event here. Every son of a bitch out the with a TV set's gonna tune in to see that. We'll make their motives so blatant, we'll shame 'em into dropping the whole thing.

But it's the country's youth who have turned the couple into the ultimate anti-heroes. Basically, the very thing that makes them most lethal is the exact same thing that captures the public's hearts and minds -- Mickey and Mallory's operatic devotion to each other. In a world where people can't seem to make the simplest relationships work and the slightest emotional commitment is considered devastating, Mick and Mallory have a do-or-die romance of a Shakespearean magnitude. To the country's youth, 75 percent of which are coming from broken homes, that's appealing. They have an 'us against the world' posture which always appeals to youth. And they've taken that posture seventeen steps beyond. It's not 'us against the world,' it's 'we're gonna kill the world.' They're exciting. I read their file and I find myself turning the page like it was a paperback. Why do disillusioned youths get into Mickey and Mallory? Why do disillusioned housewives read romance novels? Why are you filming this special? Because you know as well as I do, you say 'tonight at nine Charles Manson speaks,' everybody's going to tune in to hear what he says. Mickey and Mallory have shocked a country numb with violence. They've created a world where only two exist and anybody who inadvertently enters that world is murdered. EXT.

CU of Judge Steinsma as he shuffles paper on his bench. CU of Mickey's feet crossing the court floor. CU of Bisbing as her eyes follow Mickey across the court. Mickey enters the frame, with a pencil pressed to his lips in though. Mickey is looking straight into the CAMERA. Mickey's POV of Grace sitting on the witness stand, staring into her lap. ECU of Grace's finger rolling a large, male-style, High School class ring around her palm. CU of Mickey glancing to the ring. Mickey smiles. Mickey's POV of Grace as she pulls from a reserve of strength. Clenching the ring tight in her fist, her eyes come up and lock hatefully on Mickey. CU Mickey as he walks forward towards Grace.",

They have no more feelings about taking a person's life than squashing a tiny bug. It's all the same to them. Well, Mickey and Mallory were that 'kill 'em to watch their expression change' attitude personified. Except with each other. And, since they lived only for each other, I wanted to attack that, at its very root. So, in a nutshell, my sentence was double life for each without any possibility for parole. That would be fairly standard in their case. The twist I added was that the husband and wife would have no contact or correspondence with each other for the rest of their lives. And they would never receive any word or information about the other. So, basically once the cell door slams shut, Mickey and Mallory will completely disappear from each other's life. They'll never know when the other dies. But alas, the best laid plans of mice and men...",

The prison board is basically saying, 'We can't handle these guys.' They've moved 'em around twice since their sentence started. They were a handful everywhere they went. Now the prisons they're at now want them outta there. But no other prison's gonna be stupid enough to take 'em. So the prison board is left scratching their heads wondering what they're gonna do. Well, what they decided to do was to set up a kangaroo medical court that found them crazy. Then they get them transferred to Nystrom Medical Asylum or Lobotomy Bay as it's referred to in the psychiatric circle. Put 'em on a strict dope and electro shock diet, and Mickey and Mallory cease to be a problem to anybody except the orderlies who clean out the bedpans, which if you want to see them get theirs, that's all well and good. But there's something being said here. Forget the immorality for a second. Forget the corruption and the skulduggery involved. What the board is saying is 'we give up.' Mickey and Mallory ran amuck in polite society. They were put in an alternative society and they ran amuck there, too. All the powers that be, can't deal with these two kids.

Wayne, the boys, the deputies, even Scagnetti cracks a smile. As Mickey was telling the joke, he stopped in front of Deputy #4 during the punchline. While everybody's laughing, Mickey SLAMS his elbow in Deputy #4's face. Mickey grabs hold of the shotgun, rips it from Deputy #4's grasp, then BASHES him in the face three times with the butt. Deputy #4 drops, ugly and unconscious. Scott's CAMERA goes wild. BACK TO: COLOR 35mm. The other deputies react. Mickey pumps the shotgun slide and shoots, hitting Deputy #5 in the chest, BLOWING him off his feet. He lands on his back with a THUD. Deputy #3 raises his shotgun. Mickey drops to a crouching position and FIRES, BLASTING Deputy #3 in the groin. Deputy #3 crumples into the wall, FIRING his gun -- SLOW MOTION. The stray bullet THUNKS Scott right in the chest, BLOWING him out of FRAME. Deputy #3 drops to the floor, FIRING his shotgun straight up -- SLOW MOTION. CU of ceiling being BLASTED. Chunks of plaster and rock rain down on Sheriff #3. Scagnetti has whipped out his gun and is bringing it up to fire -- SLOW MOTION. Mickey, still crouched down, spins around toward Scagnetti -- SLOW MOTION. Scagnetti has his gun aimed at Mickey. Squatting, Mickey has the shotgun trained on Scagnetti. They're positioned across from each other on opposite sides of the room. Nobody fires. We DOLLY past the faces of both Wayne and Roger, who are flat on the ground, scared to death. CU on Scagnetti's face. CU on Mickey's face. CU on Scagnetti's finger putting pressure on the trigger, then CAMERA moves up to a CU profile of his face. OVERHEAD SHOT of Mickey. CAMERA moves down in front of him into a CU on his face.",
