He moves back on the board, trims out, slowing down. Maintains a fragile control. On pure adrenalized instinct, heart pounding, he falls in behind Bodhi, taking the same line along the roaring black face. Bodhi is like the Silver Surfer, ahead of him in the moonlight. Not wanting to drop too far behind, Johnny walks a little forward on the board.  The nose dips, picking up speed. Johnny starts letting the speed work for him, learning that he can make long floating turns up and down the glassy face. Feeling the water under his feet, the tons of water piling up behind him... feeling its awesome power and borrowing a little of it. The Silver Surfer and the quarterback rocket through the night. Utah has a big feral grin plastered on his face. Bodhi looks back.  Gives him a thumbs up. Then he cuts left and drops giddily down to the bottom, slashing back and climbing. Utah tries it, feels the drop like freefall... feels the speed. He makes his bottom turn, nearly falling. The grin dropping off his face. He falls in behind Bodhi again as the wave wraps over them like a great black wing. TYLER, paddling back out, watches them shoot past her. Utah raises his arms above his head and HOWLS like a gonzo wolf as they go by. She grins to herself, watching him. Knows he's gotten the ride that will make him a surfer for life. EXT.

Takes a chunk like a shark bite out of the doorframe by Johnny's head. Deafening in the confined space. Johnny flattens himself behind the doorframe. Tone just splits.  Down the hall like a greyhound. PAPPAS is on one knee, his piece drawn fast, holding Fiberglass in a neck-lock with one massive arm. Bunker, wild-eyed and bleeding, is on his knees in the bathroom doorway. He raises the Steyr.  Mistake. Angelo FIRES.  30 years in the field tends to show. Three rounds.  Chest.  Chest.  Head. Bunker is off the planet. MUNOZ KICKS THE BACKDOOR IN like they do in the movies. He and Cole charge into the rancid kitchen.  Badass FBI agents. JOHNNY, hotwired and hyperventilating, pops out for a shot around the doorframe.  He gets a glimpse of Warchild's back disappearing into the hallway.  FIRES.  His shot is wasted, punching plaster. Suddenly a pink freight-train hits him. He forgot about the girl in the shower. Naked except for her tattoos, she bodyslams him face-first into the wall. As he tries to turn she grabs his hair in both hands and hammers his head into the medicine-cabinet -- CRASH -- shattering the mirror. Then she knees him in the balls as he ricochets off the wall into her. She drives her elbow into his back as he drops. \"FREIGHT TRAIN\" lands knee-first on his gun hand, and viciously kicks the pistol away with one bloody foot.  It skitters under the bed. She's cut up from flying glass.  Demon-eyed and wired, her body lithe and muscular under white skin.  She sprints across the bedroom, leaving Utah slumped, heaving for breath. IN THE HALLWAY, Tone is hidden behind a doorway. White-knuckling the forty-five.  A wild-eyed kid with a big gun and not the slightest idea how to use it. He hears footsteps POUNDING behind him and spins. It's Warchild, running with the shot-gun.",

Munoz sandwiches him with the door and draws down on Warchild, who dives into a doorway. Cole drives past Munoz, who has Tone pinned, and pounds down the corridor. Cole reaches the doorway and goes for the shot on Warchild. \"Freight-train\" appears behind him from another door. She raises a pair of scissors and drives them into his back up to the hilt. Pulls them out, going for another stab, when-- Pappas spins her around and slams her face-first into the wall. UTAH, in the bedroom, sees Warchild blur across his field of vision. On pure instinct, he kicks into overdrive.  Johnny leaps the bed and goes ballistic.  His flying tackle catches Warchild at the window. EXT.  HOUSE The window EXPLODES OUTWARD in a spray of sunlit glass. Utah and Warchild crash to the ground. The razorhead, with 50 pounds on Johnny, rises like a bull. Bleeding from superficial lacerations, Warchild plows through the hedge. Johnny dives after him. The Polyester Neighbor stands paralyzed as the two crazed figures careen toward him.  He is knocked flying, and the ROARING LAWNMOWER is flipped onto its side. Utah and Warchild are locked together. The shotgun lies nearby, out of play. Warchild jerks a 6 INCH KNIFE free from its sheath, hanging from a thong around his neck.  He trusts straight at Johnny's throat. Johnny deflects the thrust -- INTO THE WHIRLING LAWNMOWER. KA-WHANGGG!!!  The knife is hammered out of Warchild's hand. Whistles away, spinning. Warchild grabs Johnny as they scramble, and heaves him bodily toward the spinning blade.  Utah catches the rim of the mower with both hands, stopping himself inches from the rotor. Warchild puts all his weight on Johnny. Pushing him face-first toward the blades. Johnny feels the wind on his face. The engine is roaring, full throttle. PAPPAS APPEARS BEHIND THEM. He aims the .38.  FIRES TWICE. The little Briggs & Stratton dies young, its casing shattered. The rotor spins to a stop. Warchild looks up into the black eye of Pappas' gun. Two inched from his face.",

The image drifts across faces, BODIES.  Surfers walking with boards. Talking, sitting with pubescent girls. The image settles on Johnny, astride his board, bobbing beyond the break. ON PAPPAS, scanning with powerful binoculars from his car. CLOSE ON UTAH, out among the flock of hardcore surfers. Ostensibly waiting for a wave, his eyes search the others around him, clicking methodically from face to face. Finally he swings his board around and awkwardly catches a ride. The modest wave carries him toward the beach as he balances, tense and style-less. He passes someone we've seen before.  The RAZORHEAD from the first day.  In concentration, Johnny doesn't see the guy. But Razorhead definitely sees him. JOHNNY reaches the beach and jogs up the sand.  He picks up a towel and talks into it as he dries his hair.  A glimpse of the walkie-talkie hidden beneath.",

So good, their boards slash past each other with inches to spare. There is an incredible sense of freedom and exhilaration. Bonding forged through mastery of this arcane art. For the first time we see the core group of Bodhi's tribe, by themselves.  It dawns on us... There are four of them. And at that moment Nathaniel drops in front of Bodhi, laughing at the near miss, and drops his pants in a nasty wig-wagging moon. TRACKING SLOWLY IN ON JOHNNY staring, mouth open. Watching the four horsemen of the Apocalypse ride toward him. IN SLOW MOTION, BODHI grins as he slashes past Nathaniel's shining white butt. ON JOHNNY, as he reacts to the dawning certainty.

They roll, skidding across the oily concrete. Spraying wild, the fire swirls around the pump island. Out of the black smoke, PAPPAS charges like an angry bull, his snubnose held high.  NIXON sees him and floors it. The Mustang smokes out of the gas station as Pappas' shots blow out the back window. Utah and Reagan roll away from the blaze.  Johnny's pants are burning.  He gets to his knees in time for Reagan's kick to take him square in the solar plexus.  He folds in half.  Drops to the cement. Reagan kicks him again and takes off running. The President is burning. His suit jacket is ablaze.  He shucks out of it as he runs. Gasping, Johnny rapidly slaps his jeans.  Puts himself out.  He comes up running, pulling his Beretta.  Sees the back of Reagan's head disappearing into an alley behind the gas station. EXT.  ALLEY A non-descript L.A. alley... commercial buildings on one side, walled suburb on the other.  Two men running all out. A recent President and a wild-eyed cop trailing smoke like a crashing jet fighter. Beyond the buildings behind them A FIREBALL EXPLODES SKYWARD.  We hear sirens and shouting, which recede as the two pelt along the alley.  It gets quieter.  Just the machine-gun slap of the shoes on pavement, and the hard breathing of the two men, each in overdrive, going all out in long blurring strides. REAGAN looks back.  Sees the demon cop behind him, gaining. Utah has become an engine, a running machine... juggernaut mode. AHEAD OF THEM a BLACK AND WHITE swings into the alley. Reagan hangs a hard left and blasts a wooden gate half off its hinges.  Utah whips through the gate a second later. Diving into suburbia. INT./ EXT.  NEIGHBORHOOD - FOOTCHASE SEQUENCE It becomes a blur.  Pure kinetic energy.  Two meteors rocketing through a low-rent suburb.  And God help anyone who gets in the way. Reagan crosses a cluttered backyard. Broken field run through toys, swing set, stacks of god- knows-what. He runs through a Mr. Turtle Pool in an explosion of spray. Crashes through a hedge. Through the narrow gap between houses. Utah powers into the tight space behind him. Blurring along between stucco walls. They emerge into the front yard. A WOMAN watering her lawn is so surprised she yelps and falls down. Reagan and Utah both hurdle her. AHEAD, KIDS ON BIKES, racing along the sidewalk. Reagan dodges the first, Utah slams into the next two. He crashes, rolling, tangled up in bikes and squawking teenagers. He comes out of a pile-up somehow still in high gear. Reagan flashes across the sunlit street. Dodges in front of a GARBAGE TRUCK which locks up the brakes. It stops so fast, one of the guys falls off the back. The GUY is getting up as Utah whips around the back of the truck. Knocks him sprawling. Utah doesn't stop.  Doesn't look back. Like he doesn't see anything in the real world but the figure running ahead of him.  Like it's some kind of hyperkinetic video game. Everything is a blur.  Suburbia smeared into staccato impressions. The house across the street is blocked by fence on both sides. A MAN is picking up his mail. Reagan pounds past him.  Right through the front door of the house. Utah follows. Panting as he sprints down a dark hallway. A WOMAN with a basket of washing SCREAMS as Reagan blasts past her, knocking her flying. Utah leaps over her sprawled legs. Cats blur underfoot.  Utah crunches down on a tail.  A CAT EXPLOSION.  Screeching merges with the woman's shrill shouts as Utah slams the back screen door off its hinges. Across the back yard.  Fence.  Over it.  Running on. REAGAN looks back. Sees Utah still behind him like in a bad dream. He enters the next house.  Sliding glass door. Utah sees Reagan pull it closed.  Locking it. Without breaking stride Johnny grabs a potted plant off a patio wall. Heaves it ahead of him. The glass BURST INTO A WALL OF DIAMONDS. Utah blasts through a microsecond later. Topples the kitchen table.  Furniture and crockery crashing everywhere. He sprints down a hallway after Reagan. A FIERCE WOMAN in a housecoat shouting at them as they pass, holding a vacuum cleaner like it's shot-gun.",

A single eyelid flutters.  Total silence, until... KABOOOOMMM!  The Pillow beside him EXPLODES into a blizzard of goosedown.  Johnny rears up, eyes wide, mouth agape.
