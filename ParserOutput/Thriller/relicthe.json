LOUISIANA BEACH - DAY The ocean is still, the air stifling and close.  A hot sun beats down on the deck of the SANTA LUCIA.  The boat lists at a crazy angle where it has been washed up on the shore.  At first glance, it appears to be deserted.  A barrel rolls back and forth as the boat is rocked by each successive wave.  We hear sirens approaching and the phalanx of squad cars pulls up.  Joining them now are TWO AMBULANCES. PENDERGAST gets out along with the others.  All of the cops immediately cover their faces, gagging violently at the smell.  Pendergast sniffs once and frowns.

They watch from a safe distance as Pendergast approaches the ghost ship.  His shiny laced wing-tips sink in the sand.  He leans down, pulls them off one at a time.  He balls both socks, puts them carefully into his shoes and proceeds barefoot towards the boat. Using a piece of driftwood as a plank, Pendergast leans it against the Santa Lucia.  With surprising agility, he leaps up the plank to the deck.  At the top he touches a rail.  It's covered in a DARK STICKY LIQUID. BLOOD.  Flies buzz loudly.  A LARGE MACHETE lies abandoned in the stern. Chairs are overturned.  A DEAD GOAT, eviscerated, lies in the bow.  A lifeboat hangs half off the stern.  Pendergast moves aft.  The COPS watch from the sand below, unwilling to get any closer.  Pendergast hears A DOOR slamming open and closed.  He follows the noise and sees... THE DOOR TO THE HOLD.  He approaches, pushes it open and looks down the stairwell.  Below deck are BODIES... stacks of them.  They've been TORN TO SHREDS. THE CAMERA MOVES down to one particular man who is nearest the top of the stairs.  It's CAPTAIN FRANCO.  His face is frozen in a howl of terror.  Flies congregate in the eye sockets.  With his foot, Pendergast nudges the body over.  The skull has been torn open. THERE IS NO BACK TO FRANCO'S HEAD . FADE TO BLACK: Silence then we begin hearing sounds of the city... horns, traffic, construction work. SUPER TITLE... NEW YORK CITY, FOUR MONTHS LATER as we...

ROOFTOP GARDEN - MARGO'S NEW YORK APARTMENT - MORNING And the woman wearing the necklace... MARGO GREEN.  She sips her morning coffee as she makes notes on several large FOSSILIZED TEETH.  Her hair is neatly combed.  No make-up.  She doesn't need it.  She has a natural, unselfconscious beauty and a mind like a steel trap. At Margo's elbow is a small T.V.  A CNN world news report plays. Margo's New York Times is open to the crossword puzzle, which she's been doing rapidly, in ink.  Clearly this is a woman who likes order, with a mind that can handle more than one thing at a time. An alarm on her watch beeps and she fills in the last two lines of the crossword puzzle, makes one final note on the fossil specimens, and shuts off the T.V.  She reaches for her back pack and looks out at CENTRAL PARK with remarkably clear eyes. EXT. CENTRAL PARK - MORNING HELICOPTER SHOT... Swooping over the fall foliage of the Park, a riot of color and botanical life... The camera picks out MARGO'S BICYCLE making its way along the winding roads, dodging taxi cabs.  Margo wears jeans, a work shirt, a fine blue gabardine jacket with a rhinestone DOUBLE HELIX PIN.  On her back is a LEATHER BACK PACK which holds her lap top computer.  She emerges from the park, catches the green light and rolls up to... EXT. MUSEUM OF NATURAL HISTORY - DAY As Margo arrives, the camera moves up and over the building, comes to rest on the imposing turrets, intersecting roof lines, and Gothic arches of the MUSEUM OF NATURAL HISTORY.  This is not an ordinary building; it's a 19th century monument to science and mankind.  The structure fills an entire city block. Happy visitors pour into the museum as Margo takes the imposing wide stone steps two at a time.  We hear SCREAMS of pleasure and release, the normal raucous noises of a large group of THIRD GRADE CHILDREN. Margo is amused to find herself surrounded by kids.  Their teacher, MRS. BEASLEY, a stern woman in glasses with a thick New York accent, calls after them as they all head inside.",

CORRIDORS/STAIRWELL - MUSEUM - DAY Margo charges through double doors leading into the southwest tower. She half runs down an elegant, Edwardian fifth-floor corridor, her footsteps lost in the thick carpet.  At the very end is a heavy oak door bearing a plate entwined with bronze leaves that reads simply \"Dr. Frock\". INT. FROCK'S OFFICE - DAY Margo bursts into the unique office, which is in startling contrast to the modernity of her own.  Two large bow windows look out over the park.  Upholstered Victorian chairs in a leaf motif sit on needlepoint carpets featuring large red roses.  Plant specimens and drawings of flora and fauna line the walls.  Cardboard boxes cover the floor. Seated in a wheelchair is a white-haired man in a tweed jacket and a loud floral tie.  Glasses slip down his nose. This is DR. FROCK, and he's in the middle of packing.

A skeleton in the center wears a headdress and tribal robes.  Gold rings encircle bony fingers.  Pendergast takes a moment to appreciate it, heads into the next hall. ON MARGO getting farther from pendergast, and ever deeper into the gloom.  The walls around her are lined with symbols of witchcraft.  There are shaman dancers, masks covered in grasses and shells.  From the New Guinea coast there is Kokpah, God of a secret male society, and Zoe- ba, an awesome mannequin in black costume with an angry pointed mask. Finally the walls open up into another gallery.  Beyond it is more of the shadowy hall.  Margo stops and for the first time she wavers.  This gallery is the most frightening yet.  It features images of THE DEVIL from different cultures around the world. In the dim light, Margo is dwarfed by abhorrent statues of SATAN, TORNARSUK (the Eskimo evil spirit), INCUBI from India, Tibet, New Guinea etc.  And there in the center of the gallery sitting on an altar and lit by a spot, is a small figurine.  Margo is instantly drawn to it.  As she gets close enough she sees the label in Gothic letters.",

But then, unmistakably... she hears it.  An odd rustling sound.  Slow. Deliberate.  Maddeningly soft on the thick carpet.  And another wave of THE SMELL.  Margo looks in the direction she came, down the long dark hall.  Her voice comes out a bit frightened as she calls... MARGO Pendergast? (no answer) Who's there? But now she freezes.  At last she's truly scared.  A shadow, black against black, is gliding stealthily towards her, moving over the display cases and grinning artifacts! Margo stands stock still, her eyes on the shadow.  She lets out a small gasp of shock.  She can't believe her eyes.  It defies reason.  Slowly, she backs up.  She slips quietly through the exhibit and out the other side.  In the next room she pauses again, listens... now hearing a distinctly animal, SNUFFLING SOUND! Something large is TRACKING HER!  There's no doubt. Overcome by a blind panic, Margo turns and runs.  She passes through a display on mythical creatures, disappears down another winding dark hall. Behind her comes... THE POUNDING OF SOMETHING IN A HEAVY, LOPING RUN!  Whatever it is, it's charging after her!  She turns another corner.  And another, tearing as fast as she can!  But now the walls up ahead are narrowing, leading to ... a DEAD END! Margo slams up against a locked door with a window of glass.  The hall features displays of terrifying totem poles.  All around the ghoulish carved faces seem to leap out!  She pounds on the door but it's useless.  She's trapped.  And the thing is coming behind her!  It's just around the last bend when it stops!  Silence again envelops her.  She's afraid to turn.  She can hear HEAVY BREATHING, and something like a low growl!  Reflected in the glass of the door in front of her is the long dark hall.  Margo starts as a face appears IN THE REFLECTION... The image is wavering and unclear.  It's a large, hulking form behind her!  TWO GLOWING SLIT GREEN EYES in the dark!  Margo SCREAMS as the thing leaps forward, hitting one of the totem poles.  Margo sinks to the ground, unconscious.  At last we hear Pendergast calling as darkness falls.",

Find Lieutenant D'Agosta.  Bring help. Jonathan doesn't have to be told twice.  He takes the dog and exits from the other side of the lab leaving Pendergast alone.  Pendergast waits a moment until Jonathan's safely out of sight.  He switches off his flashlight, backs up slowly, step by step.  He opens the door to the alcoholics storage.  As he slips inside a DARK SHAPE appears. INT. \"ALCOHOLICS\" STORAGE - NIGHT Slowly, making no sound, Pendergast lifts the .45 Anaconda, passes his finger over the cylinder, checking the loaded chambers.  Then he steadies the revolver and levels it at the door.  The hideous pickled specimens seem to hover all around him.  The smell is overwhelming and the snuffling is louder now. It's coming closer.  After a long moment there is a faint bump at the door.  This is followed by a low scratching noise... Pendergast watches frozen in horror, holding his breath. THE DOORKNOB BEGINS TO TURN!  Not knowing what else to do, Pendergast simply grabs it from the inside and holds on! OUTSIDE he hears an AMUSED SNORT, then a LOW GROWL.  There's ONE HARD HIT and the door shivers.  THE DOORKNOB FALLS OFF!  It's over now. Pendergast kneels down, bracing the gun in both hands.  From this position he can see right through the hole where the doorknob fell. His mouth literally drops in astonishment as he sees... a HUGE, red-rimmed, GREEN EYE! Involuntarily Pendergast LEAPS BACK, nearly falls and drops the gun! Beakers crash around him.  He scrambles in the darkness.  The flashlight falls and pops back on.  The beam streaks up crazily.  It's chaos. Pendergast is an easy target now.  He grabs for the light, the gun, steadies himself, breathing fast and low.  His heart pounds.  But nothing more happens.  The silence is heavy.  The eye is gone.  And suddenly Pendergast understands. In the distance he can hear HUMAN VOICES and a rolling wheelchair! Somewhere nearby are MARGO AND FROCK!  The monster has left him to get bigger game.  Fear for Margo and Frock lights Pendergast's eyes.  All panic and disorganization are gone.  He holds his revolver at 12 o'clock and KICKS the door open, leaps out as A HUGE DARK SHAPE DARTS FROM THE ROOM.  It's headed for the secure storage areas again!  Pendergast takes off.  Not knowing how else to address this thing he finds himself calling... PENDERGAST Halt! INT. SECURE STORAGE HALLWAY - BASEMENT - NIGHT Pendergast runs into the hallway but he's already too late.  The hulking shape of the quadruped is moving at incredible speed. ON PENDERGAST... as he levels his gun and shoots. THE CREATURE... stops, rears back on its haunches, looks once at Pendergast, pissed.  As the VOICES around the far corner fall silent, Pendergast FIRES.  The shot blasts off a piece of the wall. With astonishing speed and agility for its bulk, the beast turns and leaps around the corner, passing out of Pendergast's sight.",

MARGO Dr. Frock!  Quick! Frock, immobilized in his wheel chair, stares at the monster, like a trapped rabbit looking at a descending hawk.  Margo grabs his keys from him, fumbles desperately to open the door.  It swings wide at last.  She grabs the handles of the wheelchair, tugs with all her might.  The wheels bump into the door frame but somehow she wrestles the damn thing inside. INT. SECURE STORAGE AREA - NIGHT Margo shoves Frock behind her, slams the door shut.  Seconds later, the beast throws itself against the storage door.  They hear it outside, growling in fury, claws lashing out.  Margo and Frock press back in the darkness, terror in their eyes. INT. HALLWAY - NIGHT Pendergast runs forward in the echoing hallway, his gun drawn, his flashlight on.  A few more steps and he holds hard.  His eyes go wide in astonishment as his light illuminates the beast.  It's tearing at the steel door furiously with incredible force. As the flashlight beam hits it, MBWUN roars and looks up.  Now we see it clearly for the first time.  The monster is MASSIVE, putrid, rank. Slit reptilian green eyes are rimmed in red.  A ridge of stiff black hair rises on the creature's buffalo-like humped back.  The withers are muscled and covered with plates.  A forked TONGUE licks out as purple lips draw back exposing razor sharp teeth.  The claws raise up to fend off the light. PENDERGAST steadies himself with difficulty, takes a few seconds to aim with the greatest care.  Mbwun makes a move towards him and he squeezes the trigger hard.  The gun echoes in the hall.  A split second and a white streak moves right up the beast's cranium.  A direct hit. The shot echoes and Mbwun drops it's claws. The flashlight continues to shine like a high beam right into the beast's eyes.  Angry and blinded, the creature turns and in a moment, lopes off.  Pendergast watches, unimaginably relieved.  Realizing what just happened, his knees start to buckle.  He catches himself, wipes one hand across his eyes.  A voice comes from the storage room.",

The huge shape of MBWUN can barely be seen sliding out of the stairwell and into the Hall of the Asian Peoples.  Then DIM RED HALL LIGHTS come on in the corners of the ceiling.  The monster utters a low growl.  The emergency generators are beginning to come on.  The animal lopes to the spot where we last saw D'Agosta and his group, sniffs the ground.  It looks up and, with a curiously human gesture, cocks its massive head. The silence is broken by VOICES!  They're in the distance and muffled, but definitely there.  The monster crouches eagerly, lopes forward with great stealth.  The voices are getting louder.  We follow as it goes through the hall and down... A STAIRWELL... At the bottom, Mbwun quickly turns a corner... The voices have stopped.  Mbwun creeps forward, enters... INT. HALL OF MARINE ANIMALS - NIGHT A huge room several stories high.  A WHALE hangs suspended from the ceiling.  Dioramas of fish line all the walls.  Mbwun pauses next to a diorama of the gentle, vegetarian sea cow, THE MANATEE.  The two make a startling contrast. A pause and then the voices are heard again, much louder now.  The source is right around the edge of the Manatee display.  Mbwun LEAPS FORWARD, claws lashing out.  He turns the corner and crashes through a wall of GLASS as he grabs at the source of the voices... A display of small, extraordinarily life-like TALKING HOLOGRAMS! They've been re-activated with the emergency power system.  Each little talking figure is no more then five inches high.  They move around a small three dimensional display of marine animals, explaining the lung systems of fish. MBWUN... stands in the pile of broken glass, stares at the holograms, mesmerized.  He makes a noise that sounds astonishingly like a CHUCKLE! Then he reaches out one long claw and tries unsuccessfully to touch one of the holograms.  But the shadowy creatures can't be caught.  The beast seems to realize this, SNORTS and moves off.  As he goes he passes behind a LARGE GLASS ELEVATOR.  It stands in middle the open room.  The elevator is designed to carry people upstairs and down in the two story exhibit.  In the dim light, with his poor vision, the monster doesn't see D'Agosta, the Mayor, Kawakita, and their entire group SANDWICHED INSIDE.  The monster exits the exhibit and quietly D'Agosta slides the doors open.  Everyone, all thirty-five people in evening clothes, quickly get out and run across the exhibit to another stairwell at the far side of the hall. INT.

Two sets of claws curve around the bent edges of the door, then Mbwun simply LIFTS it out of the frame.  This leaves Pendergast face to face with the foul, enormous monster!  It regards him evenly, blinks once. Then the tongue slides out, licks its lips eagerly and... Pendergast FLICKS on his high powered FLASHLIGHT, shining it at close range right in the beast's eyes!  Then carefully, with total calm he FIRES ONCE, TWICE.  The beast howls more in anger than pain, REARS UP and swipes at Pendergast.  Pendergast dives to one side and, the claws miss again by inches as the beast is temporarily blinded by the light. Now Pendergast spins and runs for all he's worth.  Margo's been waiting, holding the door.",

THE CRATE!  The beast moves to it, clearly surprised.  It pokes at the crate carefully, inhales the fragrance and grunts.  The monster seems to be struggling with itself!  It sniffs the fibers, lifts a few out carefully, then SHOVES THE CRATE AWAY HARD.  Then it rises on its haunches and squints into the dark. On all sides are glowing displays of stuffed buffalo, gazelle, wild horses, wolves, giant elk, sabre tooth tigers.  Mbwun moves close to one after another.  Suddenly we notice, in the back of one of the dioramas... Margo and Pendergast!  They stand frozen, crouching behind mannequins of native Americans riding horses across the plains.  The beast sniffs RIGHT AT THEIR WINDOW, then turns away.  Confused, it heads back towards the Planetarium and slinks from the room. INSIDE THE DIORAMA...

He doesn't loosen his grip on Margo, but he leans down to look at her closer with one green, unblinking eye. She struggles not to turn away in revulsion.  His enormous jaws are right near her throat.  Everything is very still.  And then... A BARRAGE OF FIRE breaks out!  The S.W.A.T. team is in the doorway, laying down everything they've got.  The creature ROARS as if betrayed, leaves Margo and LEAPS UP.  It barrels down on the S.W.A.T. team, picks up Jennings and SPIKES HIM TO THE GROUND.  Jennings hits the floor with his neck at a crazy angle.  It snaps like a twig.  The other men drop back.  Mbwun follows, tearing through the men, cutting a deathly swath! Pendergast moves to help the S.W.A.T. team.  Margo struggles to her feet and her hand touches the wall.  Beside her is a FIRE HOSE in a cabinet!  In a split second Margo hauls it out, throws a switch and gets a BLAST OF WATER.  She turns it on the beast as it grabs for Pendergast.  The force of the water is enormous.  It pushes the monster out the end of the hall. Pendergast runs towards her, takes the hose and holds it.",

MEN'S ROOM - MUSEUM - NIGHT A row of mirrors and urinals line the wall.  It's a huge room, designed to handle crowds of visitors.  Margo ducks into one of the stalls as MBWUN crashes in.  Margo looks through a crack in the door to see... THE ANIMAL AT FULL STOP.  IT'S STARING AT ITSELF IN THE ROW OF MIRRORS! The sight appalls it and the beast lets out a hideous sound!  The claws lash out, breaking every mirror in the place, littering the floor with glass! Then the beast turns and backs up, groaning, as if cornered.  Margo sees now that one limb is dragging, leaving a trail of blood.  The mouth, too, appears to be bleeding.  The S.W.A.T. team's bullets had an affect. Margo presses back in the stall, bracing as the beast gets closer. It's just outside.  It sniffs the air once and suddenly turns, rears up, furious and crashes through the bathroom door.  Margo screams and the thing grabs her!  It holds Margo up before it and roars.  It closes its massive claws around her as if she is somehow responsible for everything.  The claws tighten!  She struggles and fights to no purpose ... but then the beast pauses... it's seen something! THE NECKLACE WITH TWO ARROWS AROUND HER NECK! It stops and its grip loosens!  A pained look flashes across its bestial face... And in that split moment Margo looks down... A NECKLACE OF SILVER gleams around the beast's throat too!  The necklace is the twin to her own! ON MARGO... Can it be possible?  She stares at the thing... MARGO John's necklace!  You killed him! Incredibly the beast shakes its head.  A noise comes from it... a sad noise, like a groan.  And now Margo gets it!  She can hardly believe it. Her eyes widen in astonishment.  She whispers... MARGO Oh Jesus.  John? The name is a knife through the monster's heart!",
