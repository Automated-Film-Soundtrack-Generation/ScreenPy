OUISHI HOUSEHOLD - DINING ROOM - NIGHT The lights are off, and there is no one in the room.  Tomoko pauses a moment, bathed in the garish LIGHT from the TV, which has been switched on.  Playing is the same baseball game they had on the TV upstairs; the same game that Tomokos parents are currently at.  The VOLUME is up quite high. A puzzled look on her face, Tomoko takes the REMOTE from the coffee table and flicks the TV off.  She walks back to the kitchen. INT. OUISHI HOUSEHOLD  KITCHEN - NIGHT A bottle of SODA that Tomoko had earlier taken from the fridge is on the kitchen table.  She picks the bottle up, pours herself a drink. Before she can take a sip, however, the air around her becomes suddenly charged, heavy.  Her body begins to shiver as somewhere out of sight comes a popping, crackling SOUND underscored by a kind of GROANING. Trembling now, Tomoko spins around to see what she has already felt lurking behind her.  She draws in her breath to scream.
