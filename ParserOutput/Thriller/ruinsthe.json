Jeff reaches for the belts, lying in the dirt beside the backboard. He quickly ties first one then another around Mathias's legs, twisting them into tourniquets, cutting off the flow of blood. Stacy and Eric stoop out through the tent's flap: they stand there staring, struggling to grasp what's happened. Stacy is in her underwear and T-shirt, blood still seeping down her leg. Amy turns to face them. Mathias is WEEPING now, his eyes shut. The hemorrhaging has stopped; blood lies in puddles across the backboard. Jeff is covered with it. And then there are the bones: so white, so wet-looking, from the knees down, nothing but bone. Suddenly, Stacy starts to SCREAM, pointing past Amy, at the dirt beyond her. They all turn to look. The vine is in motion, a long tendril slipping into the clearing, moving snakelike toward the puddle of vomit at Amy's feet. Amy backs quickly away. A second tendril emerges from the low wall of green around the clearing, then a third. They move rapidly, as if racing each other; both of them slipping alongside the first into the little pool of vomit. The tendrils absorb the puke, draining it, until all that's left is a damp shadow on the rocky soil. Then they withdraw back across the clearing, silently retreating into the larger mass of green. Stacy keeps SCREAMING.",

Jeff sets these in a row on the ground, open to the rain. Eric rushes to the orange tent, vanishes inside. Amy tilts back her head, tries to catch the rain in her open mouth. Stacy just sits there, hugging herself, shivering, still half- crying. They're all drenched, back-spattered with mud. And then, as abruptly as it had begun, the rain starts to slacken. Eric reemerges from the orange tent, carrying a thermos, a plastic cup. He sets them next to the other containers, but it's pointless; the rain is already stopping. They all stare at these meager receptacles: they've managed to catch less than half an inch of muddy-looking water. Jeff.",
