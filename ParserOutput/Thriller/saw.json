He moans in agony in the background as she stabs down again, and again, and again. Blood splashes on her hands. A quick shot back of Lawrence as he listens, his mouth open slightly, eyes wide, staring at her. Cut back to Amanda in the cell as she stabs down a few more times.

She gets it, pulls off the padlock and opens the device in the back, ripping it away from her head and throwing it down as it snaps open. She lets out the most terrible, agonized, heart-wrenching scream, sobbing loudly, her hands held out in front of her, rocking back and forth. Suddenly from another corner of the room, a light comes on, revealing the puppet from the video in the corner. Amanda sees it, staring at it wide eyed, her sobs softening for a moment as she stares at it. Slowly, it wheels towards her on a tricycle. She can only stare and cry, not sure what to do or expect.

We movie in closer to the camera, getting a better look at it as well. Suddenly there is a flash of static and we find ourselves looking at a fuzzy, black and white surveillance video of Lawrence and Adam in the bathroom, staring right at us into the camera. The shot pulls back a bit and we see that the video is on a silver surveillance monitor. A partial view of other recording-type equipment can be seen on either side of the monitor.

The little girl is Diana. Shes about 5 or 6 years old, with long, wavy light brown hair. She lays tucked in with her eyes closed, her favourite teddy bear wrapped in her left arm. The camera moves up and over her a bit, moving in closer to her. Chimes can be heard tinkling very faintly against a soft breeze. As the shot pauses just above her, her eyes suddenly open, blinking away sleepiness. She sits up, pulling away the covers, still holding her teddy bear. She remains sitting in her bed, staring over into the dark corner to her right. The chimes jingle away. We move in closer to her face; something has her spooked. A clock ticking is suddenly heard as the image fades from Diana getting out of bed into a strange, mechanical-looking clock on the living room wall of the Gordon Household. The shot lowers and we see the nicely furnished living room of the Gordon home. The walls are a dark, crimson red, the furniture in tones of red and brown. It definitely is the living room of a well-off family. Not too cold, but not as warm and homey as it could be. Diana slowly makes her way across the living room towards her parents bedroom, moving almost dream-like, her teddy bear hanging limply from her right hand. She moves to the frosted glass double doors of her parents room, opening them both into the bedroom, where we see her mother, Alison, laying on her side, fast asleep. Alison is in her early to mid thirties with long blond hair going just past her shoulders and very pretty despite her sleepiness and messy hair in this scene. Diana moves into the room, standing next to the bed, saying nothing, just watching her mother sleeping. Alisons eyes slowly open; the feeling of being watched plus the instincts of a mother have awoken her. She reaches over and turns on the light, looking upon her daughter with concern.",
