The game half-finished, frozen in a layer of dust... An easel stands before a piano.  The incomplete water color painting of a smiling elderly woman sitting on the piano bench sits sadly on the faded yellow paper. Malcolm takes in the living room silently.  He stands near the open door. Cole walks through the room.  Tiny eyes searching carefully.  He leans behind the sofa looking for something.  Malcolm watches Cole with a crinkled brow.
