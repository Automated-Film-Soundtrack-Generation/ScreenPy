Cops in riot gear, with M-16s, on patrol in a Hispanic neighborhood. BACK TO LENNY coming out of a bar with a nervous businessman.  We don't hear the conversation.  MUSIC OVER.

Lenny's beeper goes off and he pauses to look at the number. ON LENNY DRIVING. Ahead, through the windshield we see a police checkpoint. The cops have thrown a block across the street and are shinning their lights in the cars as they creep through.

Iris screams as Spreg lunges through the opening next to her like some uniformed nightmare and grabs her.  He is still running alongside, pulling on her.  Trying to drag her right out through the window. She struggles.  Bites his beefy hand.  He swears and lets go.  Then makes one last grab.  Gets his fingers into her long mane of hair.  Yanks on her.  She comes half out the window, screaming. Then... RIP!  The hair pulls off her head. Spreg drops away, behind the speeding train, holding a red wig.  He looks at it stupidly, then raises his pistol and fires at Iris. She jerks back through the window and drops to the floor. A couple of shots hit the metal outside.  We see Iris has short hair, platinum white.  In it are a few of the many pins which held the wig securely in place.  She gasps for air, sobbing and hugging her knees, trembling all over.

CLOSE ON THE CAP inside the wig: there is an intricate network of sensors in a grid over the entire underside of the wig.  The sensors are connected by wires, in a pattern like the veins of a leaf, bundling to a small, flat metal box, the size of a cigarette case.  It is a SQUID NET. Iris was wired.

IRIS stumbles along the track, clutching one shoe pointlessly to her chest.  She is swearing and crying, runny mascara leaving two tragic streaks down her pale face.  Despite this we see that she is attractive, though her dress and make-up seem designed to convey overt sexiness.  Her white skin is complemented by a wild mane of curly red hair. She is in her early twenties, and the harshness of her life has just begun to harden her features.  She looks lost and without hope, in fear of her life.  Her breath comes in hitching sobs, and her eyes are wild. She runs between cold steel walls of freight cars, looking behind her frequently.  A police helicopter is circling. Its xenon beam plays over the train yard, sweeping over the cars.  She hunches into the shadows of a freight-car as the beam passes over.  Looking under the cars she sees an LAPD patrol car cruising down a street adjoining the yard, its searchlight sweeping toward her.  It moves on. She continues her run, moving away from the direction of the patrol car.  She reaches a chain-link fence.  Crying, she scrambles over it, cutting her hands and ripping her dress.  Another patrol car passes two blocks away.  She crouches in the tall grass until it rounds a corner out of sight.",

There are people here: downtown low- life street people.  A half-block away is a brightly lit sign marking the entrance to a Red-Line subway station. She walks along the sidewalk, her eyes on the sign, feeling exposed as she walks openly, her heart pounding. She is a mess, but in this section of town people barely glance at her. LOW ANGLE on her bare feet, standing out amid the shoes and boots of winter. SHE CROSSES the street, and reaches the sidewalk just as a black-and-white rounds the corner at the end of the block, behind her. IN THE CRUISER are TWO COPS, who are scanning the street. They look intense.  Revved up.

Panting with fear and exertion she clears the turnstiles like a hurdler. The cops pound down the stairs two at a time.  Spreg draws his 9mm.  In his eyes we see an unaccountable craziness... a hunter who has as much at stake somehow as the prey. Street people fall back as Spreg thunders through them. They aren't about to get in the way of this juggernaut cop and his boy wonder. The two cops reach the platform.  No Iris in sight. MOVING WITH THEM as they slow to a walk, scanning.  A couple of low-lifes standing around, waiting for trains, eye them warily as Spreg gets a call on his Rover.",

He just deadbolts the door and locks a steel bar across the door frame, then carries his Haliburton... ... toward the bedroom.  And we see the truth of his reality.  Lenny's crib is a shit-box.  It is a small one- bedroom, barely furnished.  A couple of chairs.  Swap-meet couch.  Cardboard boxes full of tech gear stacked in the corners, unidentified electronics components piled on a table, cables strung everywhere.  God knows what this stuff is.  There is aluminum foil taped to all the windows.  Fast food cartons, empty Coke cans, pizza boxes everywhere.  The bachelor apartment from hell.  High-tech low-life. He goes into the bedroom.  Mattress on the floor.  Same infernal interior decoration, but this room is dominated by racks of tapes... Squid tapes. Lenny pours himself a vodka from a bedside bottle, takes off his clothes and hangs them over a chair.  He sits on the bed in his underwear, looking lonely and depressed. This is the private Lenny: No plans.  No dreams.  Nothing to look forward to but another day of the hustle. He puts a set of playback trodes carefully on his head, fishes around in a shoe box among a bunch of tapes, squinting at the hand-written labels: they all say \"FAITH.\" Only the dates are different. He selects one and inserts it in the deck, makes some minute adjustments.  Sips his vodka.  Leans back.  Closes his eyes.  And hits PLAY. PLAY BACK SEQUENCE/ POV: We are moving along the Venice boardwalk, following a YOUNG WOMAN on Rollerblades.  By our motion, it is obvious that we are on Rollerblades too, and not doing so well. The woman is laughing, turning circles around us, cracking up at our discomfort. We hear Lenny's voice complaining a mile a minute, and we realize the POV is his.  The girl takes our hands, skating backward, towing us along the boardwalk.  It is a sunny afternoon, and it is the usual boardwalk freak show all around us. The woman is FAITH JUSTIN, a singer.  Lenny is desperately in love with her.  It's not hard to see why.  She is beautiful, in an alive, dynamic way.  Her hair is a wild dark mane, and her eyes are spectacular... intense.  She moves with a lithe, sinuous grace.  We are staring at her eyes instead of concentrating on skating. Whammo!  The POV spins and we are sitting, looking up at Faith as she circles, laughing.  She skates over to help us up. CUT TO LENNY, on his bed, smiling.  He punches Fast Forward. BACK TO POV.  A kinetic blur of digital hash, then... We are following Faith, now holding her skates, up the steps to a beach apartment.  Inside it is funky and comfortable. Music from a disk player she left on.  Bob Marley singing \"Three Little Birds\".  Faith, covered with a sheen of sweat, sways to the music as she goes into a bedroom.  We follow her. She comes out of the small bathroom with a towel, starts to dry off.  Sunlight comes in the window lighting up Faith like she is in a spotlight.  We move up behind her and take the towel away, and now we see Lenny standing behind Faith in the mirror over the dresser. He puts his arms around her and they sway together to the music.  He runs his fingers in lazy circles over her sweaty belly.  Then leans down and licks the sweat off her shoulder, all the while watching her in the mirror.  A voyeur recording his voyeurism through his own eyes, so he can replay and relive the moment. Their eyes meet in the mirror. They both watch as Lenny slides his hand up under her halter and caresses her nipples.  She moans softly, responding.  She turns to him, and our POV shifts directly to her.  She is right in front of us, in TIGHT CLOSE UP. The intimacy is power.",

She looks through the windshield, totally distraught, trying to see where the tape landed... and sees the reflection of cop cruiser lights coming down the street.

The place is a fringe hangout, a converted schmata factory transformed into a warren of dark rooms and corridors off the main dance floor.  A thundering labyrinth.  Steel cage-like partitions of chain-link give the place a harsh, concentration-camp atmosphere.  The music is a bass tech-thump, and the clientele are young and on the rough side.  Cybergrunge. There are many large video screens running a continuous montage of wild graphics and images... a flurry of disturbing videos: MTV baptized by William Burroughs. The Fetish is a street-tech hangout, a meeting place for a lot of digital-underground types that Lenny knows.  You can buy and sell what you want here: illicit hardware and software, as well as chemicals for the wetware (brain). Lenny and Mace are greeted inside by two suited guys with metal detectors.  They barely notice as they are scanned: it's routine there days.  Mace shows her gun, a Sig Saur 9mm, and her state carry-permit.  The security guys check her pistol like a coat, giving her a claim check. Through the crowd in the lounge Lenny's eyes go immediately to one table.  It seems to be in a pool of light all it's own; or maybe this is just in Lenny's mind. SLOW MOTION: Lenny watches a man at the table holding court, with a beautiful young woman sitting next to him. It is TRAN VO.  He's a mover and shaker in the record business: he produces, he manages, he tries to keep everyone in his orbit. The woman is FAITH JUSTIN.  We recognize her from playback as Lenny's ex-girlfriend.  But now her hair has been dyed jet black and frames her face in a wild tangle.  She is wearing as expensive custom leather jacket over a sheer silk top.  She has on too much make-up, which gives her features a feral-doll quality.  Faith looks like what she is, a rock star wannabe.  But the look is red-hot. Tran looks around the room.  His eyes miss nothing.  And show nothing.  His hand -- unhurried, graceful, remarkable -- brushes past Faith's cheek, barely touching her.  His fingers pick up a strand of hair, tuck it like a treasure behind her ear... fingers touching her head now... a moment of suspended time. ... and she trembles.  Just a little.  For a second. Tran and Faith are flanked on either side by an entourage consisting of music types, various hangers on, and Tran's personal security force of four: JOEY CORTO, a whippet- thin skinhead; DUNCAN, a none-too-bright armbreaker in the classic mold; a massively built ex-jock type called WADE BEEMER; and a sixteen year old Asian stone fox, CINDY MINH, aka 'VITA', possibly the most lethal of the four.",

Opens it quietly and goes outside, moving to the wall dividing this room's balcony from the one next door. The Wearer climbs the railing and, six stories above the pavement, slips around the wall, stepping down onto the other balcony.  We hug the wall, looking furtively into the room.  It is a suite.  In the living room we see a woman making herself a drink at the mini-bar.  She turns... It is Iris.  She is wearing a T-shirt and panties. Probably ready for bed.  She looks like she can't sleep. Pours the Scotch shakily. CUT TO LENNY, the streetlight washing across his face.  He gets suddenly serious with a flash of premonitory dread. IN POV we see Iris go into the bedroom, out of sight.  We can hear the television on in there.  Using a steel jimmy the Wearer slips the latch on the balcony slider and silently opens it, slipping inside. We stalk quietly to the bedroom door, listening to her movements.  Water running in the bathroom.  We come around the door frame.  Bedroom dark, bathed in TV glow.  Iris in the bathroom, washing her face with cold water. We move toward her.  Crossing the room as she reaches for a towel.  We are now only a couple of feet away.  She comes out of the bathroom, walking right past us, drying her face.  She lowers the towel, turning away... her eyes whip back.  Widening in terror. She reacts with surprising speed, diving across the bed. We go after her. Her hand goes under the pillow and comes out with a small automatic.  She whips it around toward us but we grab it and twist it away before she can fire.  She smashes the palm of her hand into our face and rolls off the bed, lightning-fast. We follow her as she scrambles up, running through the bedroom door.  Across the living room and down the short hall to the front door.  Closing rapidly on her as she somehow gets the chain off the door and gets out into the hall. Slam!  We tackle her against the far wall of the corridor. Our right hand comes into view holding a small electric stunner.  ZAP!  We nail her right in the back between the shoulder blades. She sags to the floor, gasping.  We zap her again.  The Wearer's glance does a 180 both ways down the corridor... nobody in sight.  We clamp our hand over Iris' mouth and drag her back into her room, locking the door. ON LENNY, reacting.

Iris can now see herself as the Wearer sees her... wide- eyed with terror, white-lipped, weeping.  Helpless.  And she can feel what he feels. The Wearer's hand goes back into the fanny-pack and pulls out something else.  A black athletic headband.  We slip it over her head, down over her eyes.  A blindfold.  Now she can only see what the wearer sees. And also from the bag we pull... a yellow plastic object. With our thumb we extend the five inch blade of the razor knife, the type with tips that can be broken off by segments when they get dull.  It extends with an ominous clicking sound. We lower it toward her and cut up the middle of her T- shirt, laying it open.  Exposing her torso.  We then look down and slide the knife under the side band of her panties, slicing them off.  We put the knife up to her throat, and she whimpers, afraid to cry out, and then we draw the flat side of the blade across her body as if to tease her with the prospect of her death. MACE LOOKS AT LENNY'S EXPRESSION of dawning horror and pulls the car to the curb about a half-block from the Sunset Sheraton.  Lenny is hyperventilating, shifting in his seat as if ants are crawling over him.  He is experiencing the stalker's exhilaration. IN POV we see the Wearer pull his jogging pants down below his knees (R-rated please) and reach for Iris.  Kneeling in front of her, he pushes her legs apart and pulls her hips forward onto him, pushing into her. Iris is feeling and seeing what he sees and feels... She feels her own pain and humiliation swirling with the killer's exhilaration. ON LENNY, sweating and barely able to breath.  Mace stops the tape... concerned by Lenny's reaction.  He opens his eyes... Mace see the fear there, of what the tape may reveal.  But he shakes his head.  He has to know.  He pushes her hand away and punches PLAY. IT FLOODS INTO HIS HEAD AGAIN.  The sweaty, grunting horror.  The stalker picks up her slit T-shirt and quickly wraps it around her neck.  He knots it tight and twists one powerful hand into the knot.  The muscles in his forearm look like cables as he turns the knot tighter. The stalker viciously twists the knot a full turn and the T-shirt fabric almost disappears into the skin under her jaw. Via her trodes, Iris watches herself die.  Her death comes at the moment of his orgasm which is fed to her... blasting off the planet on total overload... terror, pain, death merging with ecstasy and exultation at the same instant. ON LENNY, crying out and grabbing for the trodes, but he just holds onto them, as if they are sucking his brains out of his skull.",

TO POV, as the killer's hand calmly moves Iris' head from side to side... studying her dead face.  Her staring eyes. He leans very close to her and stares into one dead eye, the pupil wide, seeing nothing. A burst of static.  End of tape. Lenny opens his eyes.  He fumbles open the car door and practically rolls out onto the sidewalk.  The trodes pull off his head as he lurches up, reeling across the sidewalk to a darkened storefront where he leans for support.  He doubles over and heaves up the contents of his stomach.

The HOUSE LIGHTS dim and the STAGE LIGHTS come up.  And Faith is standing there.  Like she beamed in.  She is wearing a revealing leather outfit, showing a lot of her milk-white skin.  Her black hair frames her eyes, giving her an intense feral look.  Faith starts to sing. Beautiful, unearthly, clear notes. SUDDENLY the band kicks down with a wall of thundering sound.  Faith explodes into motion.  Her body convulses like a 440 volt mainline is hooked up to her.  Her voice becomes a scream, an inchoate wail, a police siren.  The pain and rage of an entire, hell-bent tormented planet on its eve of judgment. Lost in the song, Faith has found herself.  She wheels across the stage, slashing her head up and down so that her hair bursts in the strobe-flashes like flak. A techno-erotic pagan.  A force of nature. Lenny is mesmerized.  He has seen this before, many times. But it always has the same effect on him.  He is transported into another world by her, a world in which there is only the two of them. TIGHT ON MACE, eyes on the stage... a big piece of the puzzle suddenly fits.  She's never seen Faith perform before.  Holy shit. Faith doesn't play to the audience, or engage them in any way.  She is merely taking what's in her head and letting it out.  She doesn't care if they are there or not.  Now shrieking into the silence after a climatic downbeat, and holding the note... holding it longer than you believe she possibly could.  Then nothing. When it is over she just drops the microphone and walk away.  Fuck you.",

She softly closes the sliding door and walks across the cavernous main room.  The place is lit by the flickering reflections from a series of huge television screens along both walls.  Otherwise there is little light.  The cavernous loft is sparsely but very expensively furnished.  Haute-tech design.  Total contrast to Lenny's ratty digs.

A MANILA ENVELOPE stuck between the steel bars and the glass of his front window, next to the door.  \"NERO\" is printed on the envelope. Oh shit.  He opens the door, looking both ways.  No-one is around.  He fishes out the envelope from behind the bars and takes it inside.  Of course it contains a tape.  He stares at it with dread. Lenny sits down and put the tape in his playback deck.  He picks up the trodes and places them on his head.  He notices his hands are shaking.  He takes a deep breath and punches PLAY. POV SEQUENCE: DAY.  As expected we see the de-saturated signature look of the killer's vision.  The Wearer is walking through the courtyard of Lenny's apartment building.  We recognize it by the unkempt pool, the sunken deck furniture.  We walk through a breezeway to an ally- like courtyard behind the building.  We approach a door... the back door to Lenny's apartment. The killer picks the lock on the back door.  Opens the door and enters.  The apartment is dark, blacked out.  We are in the kitchen.  We stop and listen.  Water dripping in the sink.  Soft snoring from the living room. Moving to the other room.  Slowly, silently.  Furtively looking around the door frame to the living room.  There is Lenny, crashed out on the couch. Now moving stealthily toward him.  Kneeling down beside him.  Lenny, burned out from the night before, is deep under.  Our hand comes into view, holding the yellow plastic razor knife.  With his thumb, the killer extends the blade... click, click, click, click. The blade flashes in a beam of sunlight as it moves toward Lenny.  The killer lays it gently against Lenny's throat. Draws it slowly across... not leaving a mark. The POV backs away and -- static as the tape ends. LENNY, IN THE PRESENT, whips off the trodes, freaking.  He feels around his throat with one hand... can't feel anything. Crossing quickly to a mirror near the front door, he inspects his neck minutely.  There is a hair-line red line over his carotid.  He looks around the room wildly, his heart hammering.  Slowly, he gets his breathing under control. Then... he hears something in the kitchen.  A tiny click. His eyes go wide.  Hyperventilating, Lenny moves silently into the bedroom.  He fishes around under the bed and pulls out a GLOCK 22 .45 auto pistol.  He stalks silently toward the kitchen. Then he looks at the butt of the pistol-grip: no magazine. He un-stalks back to the bed and finds a loaded magazine under a bunch of dirty socks.  He inserts it quietly, wincing as he chambers a round. Heart thudding, he works his way to the kitchen door.  He edges around the frame, pie-ing the room.  Cop reflexes intact. Mace is sitting at the kitchen table, giving him a funny look.  She is drinking a cup of coffee, made from the bottle of instant on the counter.  She is dressed casually, in bicycle pants, work boots and oversized nylon jacket over a tank-top.",

Lenny drops his bag, shakes, does a little silly hand choreography -- a goof on a bro grip -- that makes Zander laugh.  Mace watches this ritual and smiles herself. Zander can call out a part of Lenny that Mace would like to see more of. Cecile is there, hanging out with her boyfriend CURTIS, and Curtis' friend VEJ.  These two guys are about 18, dressed in gangsta garb.  They are listening to \"The Prophets of Rage\" on a CD player, and watch Lenny with a dispassion that flirts with distaste.",
