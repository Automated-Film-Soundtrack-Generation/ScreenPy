It comes to a stop in the foreground and we   see Bruno alight onto the platform. He looks about him for   a moment and then strolls away in the direction of the town.    He approaches the row of telephone booths. EXT. STATION CLOSE SHOT We see Bruno enter the small booth and start to glance through the telephone directory. INSERT TELEPHONE DIRECTORY Bruno's finger runs down the names until it stops at: Joyce, Miriam Haines. 2420 Metcalf Avenue. A RESIDENTIAL STREET IN METCALF LONG SHOT It is now much later.    It is beginning to get dark, and the street lights are on.    In the far distance we see a local bus approaching. MED. SHOT SHOOTING DOWN onto a small seat by a bus stop, we see Bruno with an open newspaper in front of him. It is held up as he reads it. CLOSEUP Bruno is glancing over the top of the paper. LONG SHOT From his viewpoint we   see a typical frame house. The upper windows are lit as are   the lower ones as well. A woman is sitting in a rocker on   the front porch.  This is MRS. JOYCE, Miriam's mother. She    has white hair. A  woman comes along the street and pauses   as she gets to Mrs. Joyce. Converted to PDF by www.screentalk.org",

LONG SHOT Again from Bruno's viewpoint, we see Miriam's house. At this moment the front door swings open, emitting a long streak ot bright light. We see the silhouette of a woman emerge, followed by two other men. They're laughing and joking. Suddenly they look up the street. At this very moment the bus pulls up in front of Bruno's view, cutting off the sight of his quarry. The bus comes to a stop. CLOSE SHOT Bruno rises in alarm and moves around toward the end of the bus so that he shall not lose sight of the girl coming out of the house. SEMI-LONG SHOT From his viewpoint, the girl, whom we now see is Miriam, is running followed by the two young men. They are calling for the bus not to go - shouting, \"Hi - stop!\" Mrs. Joyce calls from the porch:",

SHOT As Bruno starts to advance in the direction of Miriam he is momentarily held up by a small boy in cowboy uniform carrying a gun and a balloon. The small boy points the gun at Bruno. SEMI-CLOSE UP The small boy pointing the gun fires it twice with a couple of 'bangs!' He then starts to move off. SEMI-CLOSE UP Bruno moves on past the boy. He casually touches the balloon with his cigarette end -- it goes off with a 'pop'. CLOSE UP The small boy turns and looks with dismay at his pricked balloon, wondering what happened. SEMI-CLOSE UP Bruno moves on, pleased with himself, returning his attention to Miriam who is somewhere ahead of him. MEDIUM SHOT Miriam and her two boy-friends by the sledge hammer concession where the aim is to swing the hammer hard enough down onto its target to ring the bell and register the 100 mark. Miriam is in the foreground of the shot. The first boy steps up to try his hand. As he swings, Miriam turns and glances about her, obviously looking for Bruno. LONG SHOT FROM MIRIAM VIEWPOINT The crowds milling, but no sign of Bruno. Converted to PDF by www.screentalk.org",

As he takes a few steps, WE PAN ACROSS with him until, over his shoulder, we see a merry-go-round in the background. Miriam and the two boys are aboard and climbing onto horses. As Bruno goes toward the merry-go-round, the CAMERA MOVES UP A LITTLE with him. The merry-go-round starts to move slowly round as Bruno hops on. MEDIUM SHOT ON MERRY-GO-ROUND Bruno begins to look around for Miriam, who is apparently on the other side of the merry-go-round. He starts to thread his way through the horses which are beginning to move up and down. CAMERA FOLLOWING HIM. He passes one or two of the oncoming heads before he reaches Miriam. She is on an outside mount which is high in the air when she sees Bruno facing her. Her laughter dies for a moment and she smiles at him coyly. Bruno passes her and gets on the horse directly behind her, Miriam glancing at him as her horse comes down. MEDIUM SHOT BRUNO ON HORSE With horse's head in foreground, as it is coming toward us.

The shadows of their struggling figures over the shot. CLOSE UP The screen is filled with one of the lenses  of the glasses. They are of the diminishing type. Against   the moonlit sky we see reflected, the elongated struggling  figures, as though we were shooting up at them. Suddenly one   of the figures falls forward. CLOSE UP Miriam's head drops into the picture by the glasses. Bruno's hand comes into the picture and picks up the glasses. One of the lenses has been broken by Miriam's fall. As we see Bruno's sport shoes move away, the CAMERA MOVES PAST MIRIAM'S HEAD until it comes to Guy's lighter pressed into the earth. CLOSE UP BRUNO Bruno glances back over his shoulder.   He looks down and goes back one or two steps. CLOSE UP BRUNO'S HAND Bruno's hands retrieve the lighter from the ground. LONG SHOT ISLAND We see a full view of the island again, with the amusement park beyond. The faint noise of the calliope continues in the distance. Bruno has been lost to view.

Superficially, in height and figure, she resembles Miriam. She also weirs glasses. By her gestures we gather she is speaking urgently, but softly, to her father, who lifts a weary hand to quiet her as she looks toward Guy in the hallway, Barbara keeps quiet and also looks toward Guy. They both wait for him to enter. CLOSEUP GUY He steels himself for the long walk across the hall and the living room. CLOSEUP ANNE Watching Guy closely. MED.

CLOSEUP ANNE She becomes aware that this is the man she has seen call to Guy in the art museum, that they have met before. Her eyes turn a little in Guy's direction, though she does not look at him. CLOSEUP GUY He is still watching Bruno talk to the French couple. Guy is unaware of Anne's looks. Suddenly his attention is arrested by the sound of Barbara's voice calling him.

He is excited by the speed of the ride and laughs at the fight with great enjoyment. He sees this by suddenly glancing over his shoulder. In the b.g. Guy and Bruno are continuing their fight. Bruno rises. Guy staggers after him. Bruno again leaps upon Guy. The two men sway toward the CAMERA until Bruno gets alongside the little boy. The boy now shows some anxiety. The three figures now fill the screen with the horses' heads in the f.g. Bruno is forced against the little boy, who now, alarmed, beats Bruno on the cheek with one hand, the other holding onto the brass rail in front. Bruno stops and with a sweep of his arm, knocks the little boy off the horse onto the floor below. The little boy, in falling, grabs the horse's rein or stirrup. CLOSE SHOT Guy breaks away from Bruno and dives around the back of the horse to grab the little boy. CLOSE SHOT As Guy grabs the boy, he staggers forward with him to a small gondola. Bruno leaps onto his back but Guy manages to put the boy in the gondola. CLOSE SHOT UNDERNEATH THE WHIRLING MERRY-GO-ROUND The boat man is making slow progress. FROM HIS VIEW POINT We see his goal. It is the wounded mechanic in the center, who is slightly stirring. All during this the base of the merry-go-round is skimming above the back and head of the boat man.

They are flung between the horses, bouncing one against the other, almost half way around the merry-go- round. CLOSE SHOT BRUNO AND GUY Again they struggles between two horses. On each side of them are two young screaming girls. The two bounce from one horse to the other. CLOSE SHOT The calliope has little figures and these boat away on their cymbals almost as though they are applauding what's going on. CLOSE SHOT Underneath the merry-go-round, the boat man has made further progress. He is creeping inch by inch. His nose starts to run. He starts to fumble for a dirty piece of handkerchief. He blows his nose and then moves on. CLOSE SHOT Back above the two men swinging past the two girls on their horse and they both crash to the floor underneath another horse, upon which is riding side-saddle, a mother and her three-year-old little girl. CLOSEUP The two big heads of the men, battling. The two men roll underneath the horse's hoofs, which are seen rising and falling. They get right underneath one horse.
