THE OLD ABANDONED ROAD - EARLY MORNING In the stillness, as the morning sun crests the trees, their shadows move like a parting curtain, leaving sunlight to warm the old stones of the abandoned road. The ancient bridge spans the black river, idling toward the sea. It is a perfect day, tranquil except for the faint distant \"rumbling\" intruding into our consciousness. As it grows louder and LOUDER, a flock of birds is frightened from the trees, a rusty beer can by the roadside begins to tremble and roll from the vibration. Rounding the bend of the road into view are a half-dozen kids on bicycles, peddling furiously, laughing and yelling and looking back at what now appears behind them: the first vehicle of an incredible carnival parade -- or is it a funeral procession? Long, short, tall, fat vehicles; the stretch-out car, the cab towing portable toilets, the tractor pulling a generator rig, the Cortez Camper dressing rooms, the stake-bed loaded with reflectors rattling like radar screens, panel trucks with studio emblems, a vintage German army truck filled with soldiers, patrol cars and motorcycles, the huge, bright yellow construction crane on its Caterpillar treads, its pneumatic snout jutting forward thirty yards like a morning hard-on sniffing around for some tunnel to hump -- a few technicians straddle it having their morning Danish and coffee. In the midst of these, on a low-slung flatbed trailer rides the Duesenberg -- the coffin on its caisson. The caravan grinds, hisses, wheezes to a halt and the A.D., astride the hood of the first vehicle, dismounts and raises his electric bullhorn to begin what will be an incessant squawking of instructions, reprimands, coaxings and complaints. - 141 - A.D. All right, people...the rest period is over. Another fifteen minutes and we start losing sun. Come on, let's get the equipment off those trucks. The Second A.D.'s run around like sheepdogs herding the laborers, snapping at their flanks, barking their instructions over electric horns. A.D. (CONT'D) Chuck...Chuck Barton, where do you want the Duesenberg? Grips and laborers are carrying the big reflectors through the brush into the hills. A.D. (CONT'D) Mr. Cross, please. The camera crew's ready for a setup.",

DUESENBERG - WIDE ANGLE PAST CAMERON THROUGH WINDSHIELD The river rushes up and the car smashes into it with a deafening, shattering roar, plunging beneath the surface to a dark and soundless world -- except for a tiny red light, the whir of a camera and Cameron's desperate cries. Tearing his seatbelt off he flings himself toward the rear of the car, clawing at the back seat to reach Nina. Incredibly, there is sunlight again as the car is buoyed to the surface. There, again, is the living world - the road, the trees. In that brief instant, through the rear window, Cameron has a wild, tilted glimpse of a pink pinafore -- Nina, standing by the rail looking down, Eli beside her. The car noses downward, water rising swiftly over the rear window. The last image on Cameron's retina is that wild, eager, little-girl excitement on Nina's face. Then he's alone again, entombed in the darkening water as the car plunges toward the bottom. Cameron sits, immobilized at the realization that his betrayal is total. Everyone, even Nina, has conspired to bring him to this -- red light glowing, camera whirring, to capture the moment of his death.",

The memory of Chuck's voice...\"the windows.\" He lowers the front window slowly. The water now pours in faster. The level has risen to his chin. He gasps a final breath and the water rises over his head. Still the red light burns. He reaches beneath the seat for the oxygen cylinder and tries to pull it loose. It won't move. The impact of the car hitting the water has bent the seat frame. His groping hand finds the hose, the oxygen mask. A hope. Though every second is robbing his chance for life, his movements under water are as in slow motion. Pulling the mask to his face, he takes an eager breath and chokes as water fills his mouth. The rubber tube has broken loose from the cylinder and is floating free -- as it must have with Burt. Pressure of the onrushing water has stopped as the water reaches the roof. For a moment there is a strange stillness which Cameron, his lungs bursting, swims through, out the window and toward the surface.",
