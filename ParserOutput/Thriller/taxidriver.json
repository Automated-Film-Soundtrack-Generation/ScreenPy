CHARLES PALANTINE CAMPAIGN HEADQUARTERS The Headquarters of the \"New Yorkers for Charles Palantine for President Committee\", located at the corner of 50th Street and Broadway, are festooned in traditional red, white and blue banners, ribbons and signs. One large sign proclaims \"Palantine\". Another sign reads \"Register for New York Primary, July 20.\". The smiling middle-aged face of Charles Palantine keeps watch over the bustling pedestrians. It is LATE AFTERNOON. INSIDE HEADQUARTERS A variety of YOUNG WORKERS joke and chatter as they labor through stacks of papers. The room is pierced with the sound of ringing phones. Seen from a distance - the only way Travis can see them - those are America's chosen youth: Healthy, energetic, well- groomed, attractive, all recruited from the bucolic fields of Massachusetts and Connecticut. CAMERA FAVORS BETSY, about 25, an extremely attractive woman sitting at the reception desk between two phones and several stacks of papers. Her attractions, however, are more than skin deep. Beneath that Cover Girl facial there is a keen, though highly specialized sensibility: Her eyes scan every man who passes her desk as her mind computes his desirability: Political, intellectual, sexual, emotional, material.  Simple pose and status do not impress her; she seeks out the extraordinary qualities in men. She is, in other words, star-fucker of the highest order. Betsy, putting down the phone, calls TOM, a lanky, amiable and modishly long-haired campaign workder over to her desk:",

Travis makes an awkward gesture to escort Betsy into the theatre. Betsy looks at the tickets, at the theatre, at Travis. She mentally shakes her head and walks toward the turnstile. She thinks to herself: \"What the Hell. What can happen?\" She's always been curious about these pictures anyway, and - like all women, no matter how intelligent - she's been raised not to offend her date. A perverse logic which applies even more in offsetting circumstances like these. INSIDE THE THEATER Travis escorts Betsy to an empty center row. Travis was right. Couples do go to films like this. There are at least six or seven other MEN with their bewigged \"DATES\". Travis settles into his familiar porno theatre slouch. Betsy looks curiously from side to side. ON SCREEN, a conservatively-dressed middle-aged woman is speaking in Swedish about importance of healthy sex life in a happy marriage.  Subtitles translate her words. Then, without warning, there is a direct CUT to a couple copulating on a sterile table-like bed. Travis watches intently. The color, however, is slowly draining from Betsy's cheeks.

He hooks the .44 into his pants behind his back and practices withdrawing it.  He holds the .44 firmly at an arm's length, tightening his forearm muscles. He has worked out a system of metal gliders taped to his inner forearm, whereby the Colt .25 can rest hidden behind the upper forearm until a spring near the elbow is activated, sending the .25 flying down the gliders into his palm.  He has cut open his shirt to accomodate the gun mechanism and now checks in the mirror to see how well the gun is hidden. He straps an Army combat knife to his calf and cuts a slit in his jeans where the knife can be pulled out quickly. He now tries on various combinations of shirts, sweater and jacket in front of the mirror to see how well he can hide all the handguns he wishes to carry.  Finally, wearing two western shirts, a sweater and jacket, he manages to obscure the location of all three guns, although he resembles a hunter bundled up against the Arctic winter.

Whatever doesn't flush away in New York at night turns up in places like this. A burly grease-stained COOK stands over the grill. A JUNKIE shuffles from one side of the door to another. Slouched over the small four-person formica tables are several WELL-DRESSED BLACKS (too well-dressed for this time and place), a cluster of STREET PEOPLE and a lost OLD COOT who hangs onto his cup of coffee as if it were his last possession. The restaurant, brightly lit, perfectly conveys the image urban plasticity - without the slightest hint of an accompanying cleanliness. Toward the rear of the restaurant sit three cabbies: WIZARD, a worn man about fifty, DOUGH-BOY, younger family man, CHARLIE T., fourtyish Black. Wizard is telling Dough-Boy a story. Charlie T., his elbows popped against table top, is not listening. He stares silently down at a plate of cold scrambled eggs and a Racing Forum. His eyes may not be open.",

The front windshield is a little dirty, the lighted meter just up at the low right screen. The intercom crackles with STATIC and MESSAGES. The light turns green; we take off with a start. A short first gear - quick shift - a long second gear. The cab eases to the right of the street, checking out prospective fares. Our eyes scan the long lines of PEDESTRIANS. The regular - bums, junkies, tourists, hookers, homosexuals, hippies - they mean nothing now. They only blend into the sidewalks and lighted storefronts. Our eyes now concentrate on those that step away from the curb - is that man hailing a cab or scratching his head?",

TRAVIS recognizes her face: it's IRIS, the GIRL in his taxi a week or so before.  IRIS looks at TRAVIS sharply then turns and continues walking. TRAVIS' eyes follow her and she rejoins a GIRLFRIEND.  They are both dressed as hippie hookers: sloppy clothes, boots, jeans, floppy hats.  And the old come-hither walk is unmistakable. TRAVIS follows IRIS and her GIRLFRIEND slowly as they walk down the sidewalk. TRAVIS' P.O.V.  He examines them from bottom to top -- boots, legs, thighs, breasts, faces, hats. As TRAVIS rolls astride the GIRLS, he notices the familiar FRINGE OF A SUEDE JACKET standing in the shadows.  The GIRLS look toward the SHADOWED FIGURE, smile, acknowledge some unheard comment, and continue on. IRIS looks back uneasily at TRAVIS' taxi and continues on. On the corner stand TWO well-to-do COLLEGE STUDENTS, somewhat out of place in this environment, but making every attempt to groove on it.  They are high on something or another. The GIRLS spot the COLLEGE STUDENTS and walk over to them. They exchange some small talk and walk off together.  There is little subtlety involved: it is obviously a pick-up. TRAVIS must negotiate a turn around the corner if he is to continue following the GIRLS and their COLLEGIATE JOHNS. This is not so easy, since the traffic is heavy. As TRAVIS slows down to make the turn, he notices ANOTHER HIPPIE HOOKER who had been watching him watching IRIS and her GIRLFRIEND.  She walks over to the taxi, loans in the open left front window and gives TRAVIS the come-on disguised as an innocent question: C.U. HIPPIE HOOKER. 76.",

A CROWD of about 500 persons mills about, waiting for the rally to begin.  Piped pop-country MUSIC plays over the loudspeaker system. The CADRE OF SECRET SERVICE MEN, with their distinctive metallic grey suits, sun glasses and football physiques, stands out in the CROWD. On the PLATFORM are seated an assortment of LOCAL POLITICOS as well as some PALANTINE WORKERS and ADVISERS. TOM is silently reading something on the podium, and BETSY stands on the platform steps talking with ANOTHER WORKER. TOM looks up and to his left for a moment, then returns to what he was reading.  Then he returns his gaze to the upper left, watching something very closely.",

It is a political rally. TRAVIS sits behind the wheel, coldly staring at something in the distance.  His hair, of course, is still clipped short and he wears mirror-reflecting sunglasses.  Even though a drop of sweat is working its way down his cheek, TRAVIS wears his Army jacket with the bulge on the left side -- the .38 Smith and Wesson bulge. A BLOCK AWAY, PALANTINE stands on a platform outside his uptown campaign headquarters.  On the platform sit an array of BLACK DIGNITARIES.  Nearby we recognize the SECRET SERVICE MAN TRAVIS spoke to at the earlier rally: he scans the CROWD anxiously. PALANTINE is speaking animatedly.  He is an excellent speaker and captures our attention.  He drives hard toward his arguments, crashes down on his points.  His strained voice rings with sincerity and anger. C.U. of PALANTINE as he speaks.  He is dressed in rolled-up shirtsleeves and sweat pours down his face.",

TRAVIS watches the SLUM GODDESSES as they work the section of the street reserved for hippie hookers. TRAVIS' P.O.V.: some of the YOUNG STREET GIRLS are arrogant, almost aggressive, others are more insecure and inexperienced. A BLACK MAN charges down the sidewalk across the street from TRAVIS.  He walks at a fast, maniacal clip, looking only at the sidewalk in front of him.  Out of his mouth comes a continuous stream of invective: \"That-cock-sucking-crazy-no- good-asshole-bitch-when-I-get-my-fucking-fingers-on-her- nigger-tits-I'm-gonna-ring-em-and-shit-up-her-ass...\" and so on.  He is Out of Control.  Nobody seems to notice or care. TRAVIS takes a swig of peach brandy and continues his stake- out. Finally, TRAVIS spies the object of his search: IRIS walks down the sidewalk with her GIRLFRIEND.  Iris wears her large blue sunglasses. TRAVIS checks to see if his .38 is in place (it is), opens the door and exits from the cab. Flipping up the collar of his Army jacket, TRAVIS slouches over and walks toward IRIS.  He sort of sidles up next to her and walks beside her: TRAVIS always looks most suspicious when he's trying to appear innocent.",

They make their way past one person, then two, then a cluster of three or four.  SOUNDS of rally increase. We see a FULL FIGURE SHOT of TRAVIS: he is standing alone in an opening near the fringes of the CROWD. TRAVIS looks like the most suspicious human being alive. His hair is cropped short, he wears mirror-reflecting glasses.  His face is pallid and drained of color, his lips are pursed and drawn tight.  He looks from side to side. One can now see the full effect of TRAVIS' lack of sleep and sufficient diet -- he looks sick and frail. Even though it is a warm June day, TRAVIS is bundled up in a shirt, sweater and Army jacket buttoned from top to bottom. Under his jacket are several large lumps, causing his upper torso to look larger than it should.  He is slightly hunched over and his hands shoved into his pockets.",

Underneath there is a more discreet clipping without photo from the N.Y. Times.  Two-column headline reads: \"Cabbie Shootout, Three Dead.\" 3. A follow-up story from the News.  Two-column photo shows plain middle-aged couple sitting in middle-class living room. Two-column headline reads: \"Parents Express Shock, Gratitude.\" 4. A two-column Daily News story without photo.  Headline reads: \"Taxi-Driver Hero to Recover.\" 5. A one-column two-paragraph News story stuck on an obscure page.  Headline reads: \"Cabbie Returns to Job.\" -- At the end of the clippings, a letter is tacked to the wall.  It is a simple letter hand-written on plain white paper.
