CITY (UNDER THE DOOM) - DAY The bus pulls up outside a modern tourist hotel.  The buildings surrounding it have a much more improvised, temporary look.  Most are pre-fabricated structures. The streets are crowded and there is a \"frontier-town\" atmosphere.  Stalls sell fruit and vegetables, also water and air containers. A lot of greenery is evident - this is to absorb CO2 and emit oxygen, thus helping with the air supply under the dome. Some small, ragged boys look at QUAIL as he looks around before going inside the hotel.  Suddenly, one of them throws a small sack at him.  It hits his chest and leaves a yellow stain.  The hotel DOORMAN chases the boys away....",

Quail walks past, enters the main lobby.  The atrium entryway is absolutely fabulous; a complete contrast to the dirty, Casbah-like streets.  AFFLUENT-LOOKING PEOPLE in spotless linen fill the lobby. Quail stops to examine a large ROTATING DISPLAY sitting on a table in the middle of the lobby.  It is a stand-up model of a SPHINX.  Across the top is written \"THE FIRST WONDER OF MARS\".

Bennie gets up off the floor, shaking off Quail's punch-- 121     EXT. DESERT - DAY The E.I.O. vehicle are a half mile off -- and closing in. 122     INT. SAND MOLE - DAY Quail glances at the vehicles, turns to Bennie -- ready to jump him.  But stops short at what he sees Bennie doing. Bennie is clipping on his MECHANICAL ARM.  It sprouts several rows of vicious-looking STEEL BLADES -- BENNIE This makes Bennie a cut above anyone else. Bennie presses another button and the BLADES START SPINNING. Bennie's mechanical arm is in effect now a BUZZ SAW! The fight begins.  Bennie attacks Quail with his buzz-saw arm;  Quail dodges.  Bennie's arm shreds various articles in the cabin -- and keeps Melina at bay with well-timed swipes.  Finally Bennie gets in a roundhouse punch to Quail's jaw with his real hand.  Quail sprawls, dazed. Now Bennie goes for the kill.  But Melina leaps onto him. Bennie grabs her by the hair and moves his SPINNING HAND in for the quick kill.  Melina clutches the terrifying appendage with both hands, desperately keeping it at bay. But her strength is no match for Bennie; the whirring blades are just about to bite into Melina's neck when -- Quail comes back, lands a ferocious rabbit punch to Bennie's spine.  Quail lunges at him, grabs the blade weapon;  he and Bennie crash into the cabin wall and -- The BLADE RIPS CLEAR THROUGH THE MOLE'S WALL!  Alarms sound as a GAPING HOLE IS BLOWN IN THE SIDE OF THE CABIN!  ALL THE AIR IS SUCKED OUT BY MARS'S EXTERNAL VACUUM! Now no one can breathe.  They all claw for their masks, [still] in place.  Bennie is first;  he recovers, lunges with his SPINNING ARM for Quail.  Quail barely dodges, grabs the arm, muscles it back toward Bennie -- The SPINNING BLADES SEVER BENNIE'S OWN OXYGEN LINE!  Gasp- ing, he falters.  Quail aims a titanic blow, PUNCHES BENNIE out through the hole in the mole's wall! Quail and Melina, masks on, stare out as Bennie claws desperately at his severed air line.  The Martian vacuum pulls the oxygen from Bennie's lungs, he chokes, staggers -- 122AA   EXT. DESERT - DAY Bennie is beside the vehicle.  He implodes like a balloon with all its air gone. 122AB   INT/EXT. VEHICLE - DAY Melina hides her face in horror.  At that instant -- 122A    EXT. DESERT - DAY Bullets dig into the sand all around the vehicle.  The patrol cars are only a few hundred yards away!  Loud- speakers call for Quail's surrender. 122B    INT. VEHICLE - DAY Quail lunges for the vehicle controls.  Presses a button marked \"Dive\".  The vehicle tilts. 122C    EXT. DESERT - DAY The vehicle burrows powerfully into the sand.  As the patrol cars close in and rake the desert with gunfire, the vehicle vanishes from sight.  In the distance, the Sphinx looms ominously. A driver in one of the patrol vehicles (filmed from outside the windscreen) is speaking into a microphone.  He can't be heard but can only be radioing a report. 123     INT. SAND MOLE - MOVING - UNDERGROUND The little mining vehicle moves powerfully, propelled by its BORER NOSE. Quail mans the controls while Melina struggles to shore up the gaping hole in the side, into which SAND is POURING as the mole moves forward.  Quail looks at a compass in the control panel.  He makes a correction.",
