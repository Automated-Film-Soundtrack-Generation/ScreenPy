Elijah follows the voices. He carries the stuffed animals through the crowds of people. CLICK. CLICK. CLICK. His metal brace sounds as he walks. For a moment, he sees nothing but bodies all around him. He emerges amongst a huddle of teenagers who wait at a turnstile. A man in a red and white striped coat takes their tickets and waves them in. Elijah looks up and sees the sign above the turnstile... \"The Hurricane.\" He watches the teenagers giggle as they each into a grey cup-like seat. They pull the metal bars down in front of them. The man in the red and white stripes leaves the turnstile. Elijah stares up at the multi-colored sign. Beat. He moves quickly. Ducks under the turnstile and climbs onto the platform.

He presses them to check their softness. He places the stuffed animals on either side of him on the seat. He's wedged in between them. Feels good. He reaches out and touches the hard rusted metal bar in front of him. Elijah looks a little anxious. Beat. He pulls off his sweater and wraps it around the bar. It goes around twice before he ties the arms together. He checks its softness. Elijah looks around the customized cup-like compartment he sits in. He smiles an eight year old smile of pride.

The teenagers CHEER. Elijah's eyes fill with joy as the wind plays against his face. Suddenly the ride changes directions. The cup-like seats get jerked. Everyone grabs the metal bars to hold on. Elijah laughs as he smashes into the stuffed animal on his right. It cushions him and then falls to the floor of the compartment along with the other stuffed animal.

His hand comes down with something wrapped in a t-shirt. He unwraps it. It's a handgun. He stares at it for a beat before wrapping it back up and replacing it to the highest shelf. He stretches even more. Reaches farther back. WE HEAR SOMETHING SLIDE ON THE SHELF AS HE PULLS IT FORWARD. He pulls down a folder jammed with clippings. He opens the folder to reveal a young David in football uniform holding his helmet in the air victoriously. The word \"Champion\" is written over his head. David flips through the top clippings - all are images and stories of David and football. He turns the pile over. Goes to the last clipping. This piece of paper is folded over three times, unlike the others. He opens it. It's a newspaper headline. It reads... \"CAR ACCIDENT LEAVES TWO INJURED\" David puts the new headline next to the old one... They look like a set. Even the font is similar. David stares at the old headline. Stares hard at the photo of the bent and heavily damaged car laying upside down in the middle of the highway... The bulb seems to flicker. David is utterly still. SOMEONE KNOCKS AT THE BEDROOM DOOR. David gets startled. He puts back the clippings. Stuffing the new one inside with them. He replaces it back to the top shelf and leaves the closet.

Three walls of the locker room are lined with shiny lockers. One side of the room has benches and massage tables. The far end of the room has work out equipment. About twenty players and trainers are scattered throughout the spacious room lost in their own pre-game rituals. David watches as a massive muscular player takes a seat on the massage table and removes his dress shirt. His body is covered in old bruises. He lays down, wincing a bit from the pain. A trainer begins to massage him. David just stares at the battered athlete. His gaze moves across the room. Beat. David stares at something in the crowded room then he starts towards it. He moves through the room of players and trainers. He moves to the one area of the large room not occupied by anyone. David comes to a step at the foot of an Olympic bench press. Racks and racks of free weights sit behind the press. David looks down at the thick silver bar. Three large black plates are on either side. Six in all. David looks back and glances at the double doors where he should be standing. Beat. He looks to the twenty or so players and trainers in the room. Some of the players have headphones on. Some are staring into space. A couple are on cell phones... No one notices David Dunne as he reaches for a forty-five pound black plate off the weight rack. The huge disc slides onto the bar with almost NO SOUND... A matching forty-five pound disc goes on the other side... And then David adds another. He matches it on the other side... THE BENCH CREAKS just the slightest bit as David takes a seat. No one notices the security guard lay back on the bench. David's hands take hold of the shiny bar. He closes his eyes... David's arms become tense. He pushes against the weight. It doesn't move. His face turns deep red. He opens his eyes and stares at the bar as he keeps training. His face and arms are shaking... He keeps staring... focusing. And then, without any fanfare, the bar lifts off the arm rest. The weight hovers over David. He lowers it to his chest for a second time. His arms aren't shaking anymore. He pushes the weights back up. He carefully brings the bar back to the arm rest. It touches down with the smallest of CLINKS. David's fingers uncurl from the bar.

A fenced gate with a lock stops his progress. David looks through the fence down to the tracks. Just to the side is a construction site. Cranes and lifts and various equipment stand idle in the area next to the section of train wreckage that has been brought to the station grounds for dismantling and salvaging. The bent shapes of the train pieces can only be glimpsed in outlines as they sit in the darkness, hundreds of feet away from the immaculately lit train station. Beat.

Almost all the lights in the middle class homes he's passing are off at this late hour. No one is out walking except him and David Dunne fifty feet behind.

He turns into a driveway of one of the homes. He stops and pulls a wad of mail out of the mailbox. David stands with the hood of his security coat covering his head and face. He stands in the shadows and watches silently as the man in the orange uniform looks over his massive shoulder before turning a knob and entering the white paneled house through a familiar side door with a screen on it. CUT TO: INT. LAUNDRY ROOM - NIGHT The side door opens with almost no sound. The hooded figure of David Dunne steps into a narrow laundry room. THE SOUND OF A TELEVISION IS HEARD FROM ANOTHER ROOM. A very large pile of unopened mail sits in a mound on the clothes dryer. Two or three days worth. David shuts the door very slowly. CUT TO: INT. KITCHEN - NIGHT THE SOUNDS OF CHEERING FROM THE TELEVISION IN THE NEXT ROOM SPILL INTO THE KITCHEN. David stares out from under his hood at the mess. Cabinets are left open. Empty cans of food sit on the counter with a handful of unwashed dishes. The breakfast table is the eeriest thing in the room. It sits frozen with a plate of half-eaten, now moldy eggs at one setting and two bowls of colorful cereal in another. The cereal has dissolved in the old milk. Two cockroaches are crawling in the bowl. David moves slowly to a door in the kitchen. It's slightly open. As David gets closer, he shields his face from the strong smell. He pulls the door open quietly. A SHAFT OF KITCHEN LIGHTS FALLS DOWN THE STAIRS INTO THE BASEMENT. At the bottom of the stairs is a MAN'S BODY. The same man who answered the door in the flashback lays partly in the shadow, partly in the light. His crumpled tie lies folded over itself on his still chest. CUT TO: INT. FAMILY ROOM - NIGHT A BOXING MATCH BLARES ON THE TELEVISION. Empty beer bottles and coke cans sit in a pyramid on the coffee table. David steps into the unoccupied room. His movements are slow and tense. THUDS OF HEAVY FOOTSTEPS COME FROM THE CEILING OF THE ROOM. David looks up and follows the SOUND AS IT MOVES AROUND ABOVE HIM. David moves to the stairs as SOMEONE GETS KNOCKED OUT ON THE TELEVISION. CUT TO: INT. GIRL'S ROOM - NIGHT Three closed doors converge on a landing. David opens the closest one. It's a young girl's room. Posters of boy bands are on her wall. Clothes are everywhere. The room is empty. A NOISE COMES FROM THE HALF OPEN BATHROOM DOOR ATTACHED TO THE BEDROOM. CUT TO: INT. BATHROOM - NIGHT A slightly overweight girl, probably fourteen years old is tied by her wrists with a phone cord to the metal towel rack in her bathroom. She sits with her arms pointed upward over her head. He knees tucked up to her chest. Next to her is her younger brother. A skinny boy, maybe twelve. He's tied and seated in the same way. Their heads are leaned back against their arms. They're completely listless. Eyes half mast. They watch as the door to the bathroom opens and the dark hooded figure of David Dunne steps in. His long dark slowing rain poncho still dripping water. He stands in the doorway for a moment before moving towards them. They don't react in anyway as David reaches for the phone cord and unties them. They're arms flop to their laps as they gaze up at the figure leaning over them. They boy blinks once slowly.

David uses his hands to push his body off the tarp. His hands sink into the water as his pressure pushes the tarp down. THE FIRST SOUNDS OF NYLON SLIDING AGAINST CONCRETE START. David stops pushing. His vision catches the corner of the swimming pool as the tarp slides out from under the sand bags that hold it in place. The tarp sags. David becomes utterly still. THE SOUND CONTINUES ANYWAY. One by one the tarp starts sliding out from under the sand bags all around the edge of the pool. And then without warning, the tarp caves in.

TWO SMALL FIGURES NOW STAND IN A BLURRED SILHOUETTE NEAR THE EDGE OF THE POOL. FLASHES OF SOMETHING SHINY THEY'RE HOLDING... A ROD OR POLE... IT'S SHAKY NEBULOUS IMAGE WAIVERS IN THE AIR ABOVE THE SURFACE. David's only free hand reaches for the light. It catches the silver pole. The tangled mass of David and the tarp are pulled slowly towards the edge of the pool. David's head and shoulders emerge from the darkness. He takes hold of the pool's edge. Huge desperate breaths as he pulls his body out from the water and the grasp of the tarp. He hauls himself onto the ground. He sits hunched over in a dark mass, his head down under his hood. The rain poncho covering him like a blanket. Beat. He rises to his feet. The water rushes off of him. His breathing is slowing, calming. He stands in a silhouette from the light of the house. He turns and looks to the two small figures standing near the edge of the pool. The children from the bathroom stand still in the rain. They're holding an aluminum pole with a brush head for cleaning the pool. They stare up at the hooded figure. No one says anything. CUT TO: INT. MASTER BEDROOM - NIGHT The man in the orange one-piece uniform stands over the woman tied to the door handle of the bathroom. His back is to us. He's drinking from a beer bottle as he looks down at her. He doesn't notice the third presence come into the room. He doesn't hear him move closer. Right behind him. The man in orange takes another sip of his beer, not realizing an arm is reaching over him... He doesn't get to swallow the sip in his mouth. David Dunne's powerful arm wraps around the man's thick neck. David's hands clamp together like and iron vise. He squeezes. The man's beer bottle crashes to the ground as his neck begins to get crushed. David yanks back hard, pulls the man off balance. The man's legs push back violently, sending both of them backwards across the room. They come to a hard stop as David's back gets RAMMED INTO THE BEDROOM WALL. The huge man in orange pulls away and then SLAMS DAVID harder against the wall. David's arm remains locked around his throat. The man becomes frantic. His face turning dark red. He clutches at David's arm. He spins, taking David with him into another wall. The IMPACT IS TREMENDOUS. The room shakes. David holds on. His face bent low and hidden under his hood. And then the man in orange throws a powerful elbow back. It lands hard right in David's side. David groans. The huge man delivers another one. Savage, desperate blows. WE HEAR THE IMPACT OF EACH ONE WITH DAVID'S BODY. And David never lets go. The elbows slow and then stop. The legs of the man in orange start to buckle. David pulls him back onto his heels. He turns him in a half circle. All of his tremendous weight is hanging from David's arm now. David LETS OUT A YELL AS HE APPLIES ALL HIS STRENGTH. The man's legs stop kicking. David keeps turning him. The man's body goes completely limp. David's just dragging two hundred and seventy-five pounds of weight in a circle over the carpet now. David slowly comes to a stop. He stands there with his arm wrapped around the man's neck....The man's limbs dangle down to the ground. Beat. David's hands let go of each other. His arm slips out from under the man's jaw. The man in orange crumples to the ground like a rag doll. The only SOUND IN THE ROOM IS DAVID'S HEAVY BREATHING. Beat. He moves to the woman slumped against the door.
