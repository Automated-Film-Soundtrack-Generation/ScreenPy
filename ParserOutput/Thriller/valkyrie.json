We gradually PUSH IN tight on their faces, watching an entire conversation take place without dialogue. Each has a secret the other can guess. Stauffenberg looks at Nina, then her belly, first realizing and then questioning. Nina smiles and nods. Stauffenberg hugs her, delighted, but his delight is tainted with worry. Then the tables turn. Nina looks at Stauffenberg, as if divining his secret. His face never changes - a statue with that same tainted smile. In her face we see slow, grim realization. She may not know exactly what is going on, but she knows it is something. She does her best to keep smiling for the children. After the longest of moments, she nods. \"All right.\" Then she puts her head on his shoulder, hiding her fears. It is an important moment. Read it again, taking the time to picture it in your mind. Then leave it alone. Done right it's a beautiful scene about a man, his family and the fate of the world. 27   INT. STAUFFENBERG FLAT - DINING ROOM - NIGHT             27 Nina reads a story to the children in the adjoining room - an idyllic scene. The sound of the phonograph is soft and constant. Stauffenberg picks at a late dinner, now adept at the use of only three fingers. Berthold sits across from him, deeply troubled by whatever conversation we have just missed.

For the first time we see his scars and deformities in full. He looks himself over, finally focusing on the chain around his neck, contemplating the small cross and the ring - its engraving: finis-initium [end-beginning]. Though his face is clean-shaven now, he continues, slowly running the razor down his throat. Then he stops, pressing the blade a little too hard and bringing blood. It almost seems intentional. CLOSE ON: The box that holds his glass eye, staring. 73   INT. STAUFFENBERG FLAT - BEDROOM - LATER                  73 Stauffenberg has since mastered the process of dressing himself.
