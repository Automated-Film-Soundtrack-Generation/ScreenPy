A sign in the window identifies it as \"The Sleeping Dog - Hand wrought jewelry and gifts.\"  Claire tries to open the door, but sees a closed sign. She steps back out to the window and looks in.  On display are a selection of handcrafted jewelry and curios. Suddenly her eye stops on a small silver bracelet with an intricate ROSEBUD.

Finally she reaches the picture of their wedding, reaches behind the photo and produces...THE KEY. EXT.  DOCK - NIGHT Claire in her nightgown and a jacket, walks slowly down the dock.  An expensive looking flashlight illuminates her path. She stops and stares out at the moonlit lake. She holds out a fist.  Her fingers unfold and in her palm lies THE KEY.  She holds the key out over the water and stands there, frozen.  The lighthouse beam sweeps past her once...then again. Claire pulls her hand back and holds the key to her chest, then carefully places it on the dock.

She hears the hissing of the smashed radiator, then sees Norman, a shattered bloody mess on the floor of the cab. She leans over to see if he's dead, hears a squeak and realizes that the pickup, with the BATTERED SAILBOAT AND TRAILER miraculously still attached, is rolling deeper into the water. Before she can get the door open, the truck is half submerged.  She frantically manages to lower her window halfway and starts to pull herself out.
