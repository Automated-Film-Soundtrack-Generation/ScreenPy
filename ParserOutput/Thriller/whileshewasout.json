EMPTY HOUSING ESTATE - EVENING More empty houses in varying stages of construction. No sign of life. 60                                                                 60 EXT. FILLING STATION - EVENING Then, what looks like a filling station, one light on in the kiosk. 61                                                                 61 INT. FORD EXPLORER - EVENING Hope. She pulls in and dims her lights, drives right up to the kiosk door. Hope dashed. 62                                                                 62 EXT. FILLING STATION - EVENING It's in its final stages of installation but definitely not functioning. And there's no one there. 63                                                                 63 EXT. EMPTY HOUSING ESTATE - EVENING Back onto the road and she sees far behind her, car headlights that can only belong to the Plymouth, following her through the darkness. She dims her lights to just the side lights. Hurtles along the dark road which is getting rougher and rougher. Potholes filled with mud and rain water splash against the car. 64                                                                 64 INT. FORD EXPLORER - EVENING Her wipers struggle to cope. She can hardly see through the front window. 65                                                                 65 EXT. ROUGH ROAD - EVENING The potholes yawn deeper. The asphalt ends. Gravel deteriorates to dirt. 66                                                                 66 INT. FORD EXPLORER - EVENING She steers the Ford blindly. Scene 67Page 38 67                                                                67 EXT. ROUGH ROAD - EVENING A wooden barrier with reflective stripes looms suddenly ahead. 68                                                                68 INT. FORD EXPLORER - EVENING She guns the engine and ducks sideways as her car PLOWS into the barrier. There's a sickening crack as shattered windshield sprays around her. 69                                                                69 EXT. EDGE OF WOODS - EVENING The Explorer SLAMS through and VEERS towards a clump of trees. 70                                                                70 INT. FORD EXPLORER - EVENING Della tries to sit upright but the auto's spinning too fast. 71                                                                71 EXT. EDGE OF WOODS - EVENING The car swings, then CRASHES right into a Pine tree. 72                                                                72 INT. FORD EXPLORER - EVENING The Car stalls out. SILENCE. A prolonged moment. Then Della crawls out from under the dashboard, sweeping pine needles and glass from her hair. She reaches up and hits the light switch. Pine branches protrude through the broken windshield. Using the sleeve of her coat she sweeps broken glass from the driver's seat and sits down. She slides the gear into park, turns the key. The engine groans like a dying animal, then gives up. She takes a deep breath. She tries again. The engine groans again, another death rattle. It just won't catch. She switches off the interior light and pushes the driver door open. She steps out of the car. Scene 73Page 39 73                                                                 73 EXT. EDGE OF WOODS - EVENING She closes the door behind her so's not to trigger the light switch. Finds her legs are giddy. Holds onto the door frame for a moment to steady herself. It looks like she's crashed at the very end of the housing development - where it cuts like a knife edge into an old forest. The dirt road stretches ahead beyond the barrier, into the midst of the forest. Behind her, shrouded in darkness, houses in different stages of development dot the deforested landscape. Land moving trucks sit on recently flattened land, waiting to tear into the next layer of forest. Patches of leftover snow and puddles of rain catch the light from the moon which hides in an overcast sky. Jesus! She's driven all the way from the Mall only to find herself in the middle of nowhere with a bunch of psychopaths on her tail. This must be some sick joke. Speaking of which, where are these little bastards? Her eyes scan the darkness for a sign. Nothing. That doesn't mean they're not close by. She checks out the damage to the car by feel. The driver's side is scratched and dented. The front is wedged into the tree. The only way out is for her to back up the car. She climbs back in for another try. 74                                                                 74 INT.   FORD EXPLORER   - EVENING Della turns the key. It barely even groans this time. Just a faint gurgle. Then gone. She rifles in the glove compartment and pulls out the flare, sticks it in her pocket. She leans under the dash and manually pops the trunk. 75                                                                 75 EXT.   EDGE OF WOODS - EVENING Della runs outside to the back of the car and feels about in the trunk. Scene 75Page 40 She throws carrier bags full of wrapping paper to the side as she searches. Pulls out a lug wrench from underneath and then a small tool box. She hears the screech of a car's wheels spinning in mud. 76                                                                76 EXT.

EDGE OF WOODS/CONSTRUCTION SITE - EVENING Beyond the rows of plots of land with their sold signs, she sees the boys still pacing and debating beside her Ford, illuminated by the sweeping light rays of their flashlight. Her eyes drift across the landscape of house foundations and structures to the distant neon lights of the shopping mall. When she looks back over for the boys, she sees that the flashlight and the boys are gone. She strains her eyes. Guesses that must mean they're off looking for her in another direction. She clutches the tool box and silently creeps between the houses. If she could just track along the edge of the development she could maybe make it back to the Shopping Mall, to the twins. An owl hoots from the trees behind. She freezes, eyes sweeping the immediate area for danger. She waits a moment, silence, then makes her way once more between the edge of the development and the edge of the trees. She's trying desperately not to make a sound, praying to be invisible, eyes darting around, evaluating every shape and form. On one side the dense wood of trees, predominantly pine, with thick ancient trunks and tangled branches. On the other, plots and structures of homes to be. She keeps trudging on, skirting the edge of the trees, following the lights in the distance. She hears a loud thudding noise. Stops. Stops breathing. 82                                                                82 EXT. PLANKS IN TARP - EVENING Ahead, piles of planks wrapped in black tarp block her view. She braces herself, peers cautiously around, sees nothing. She clutches the lug wrench and toolbox and steps forwards. Scene 82Page 46 Rain water from the branches of a nearby tree is dripping down and collecting in a puddle in the middle of the tarp causing the sound. She breathes a sigh of relief. 83                                                                 83 EXT. CEMENT PILES - EVENING Heaps of damp shingle and cement cause her to back up and around past them and a cement mixer. She loses sight of the neon mall lights. She panics. 84                                                                 84 EXT. CONSTRUCTION SITE - EVENING She runs between the foundations of two houses. She stops suddenly when she sees a giant shadow looming across her path. She ducks down the side of a half finished house. Sees that it is the shadow of an earth moving truck. She keeps going, between the houses, looking for a sign of the mall lights. She stops. Just ahead, a flurry of footprints. They're her footprints! 85                                                                 85 EXT. UNFINISHED HOUSE 1 - EVENING She finds herself back where she started, at the same house.

UNFINISHED HOUSE 4 (FOUNDATION) -EVENING She crawls into the foundations of a nearby house, underneath the floorboards which are lain roughly across to form a first floor. She huddles in a dark corner. It's very quiet and cramped. She tries not to move, not to breathe. The smell of the wet earth underneath makes her feel nauseous. A moment passes. It feels like an infinity. Scene 95Page 49 She starts to creep along towards a gap in the planks to see if she can see anything above. Just as she approaches the gap she hears. The sound of footsteps above her. She freezes. The footsteps make erratic rhythms across the planks. She silently undoes the catch of the toolbox. Her hands are shaking. She lifts the lid. She rakes around inside for tools, comes across several kids toys instead! In shock, she rakes around some more, trying to find something else, something more dangerous, anything. To her surprise the only tools inside are a pathetic little screwdriver and a small crescent wrench. The kids must have borrowed the other tools replacing them with the toys. She gives up, closes over the lid. Then suddenly: BOOM 96                                                               96 INT. UNFINISHED HOUSE 4 -EVENING The whole house is illuminated.

It's pitch black beyond. Then she steps in. She follows her breath into the icy blackness. Branches and foliage scratch against her face. She grapples about, looking for hiding places between the dark shapes and forms. Steps between tree roots and shrubs. Her eyes begin to adjust. She can now make out the difference between the clumps of darkness and tell, looking back, where the edge of the woods begins. A construction light shines behind like a distant moon. Scene 97Page 56 She pushes between the branches of indistinguishable trees, some thick and knotted, others slight and brittle. Only the evergreens still have their foliage. Looking back constantly to the edge of the trees for a sign of the boys. Fear drives her further into the woods towards where the trees grow even more densely together. Where there just may be the right place to hide. She stops for a second to catch her breath. The handle of the toolbox has chaffed her right palm. She changes hands. God, that boy Huey! He really died back there. She heard the sound of it. The horrific sound of him dying a stupid pointless death. It could have been her. There has to be some way out of this nightmare. Ahead, a dead tree with spectral branches blocks her path. She steps around its huge trunk and tangle of roots.",

Just shadowy clumps of trees. Should she stay put or should she run? Then she sees it. The flashlight weaving through the pines ahead. She pushes further in among the roots, tries to make herself invisible. The flashlight beam sweeps across the forest floor towards her. One set of footsteps crunches through the foilage. She holds still, terrified. The flashlight pauses on the dead tree, the roots. Scene 97Page 57 Della stops breathing. Then, the light sweeps past and on into the woods. She waits until it disappears before stepping out of her hiding place. She creeps back in the opposite direction, figuring if they're in the woods now she should get out. Her eyes search for the construction light, which indicates the edge of the wood. She heads in the direction of the light, painfully aware that one noisy footfall could alert her pursuers. She steps between leaves and roots as delicately as a ballet dancer. The construction light grows closer. The light abruptly goes out. She stops, eyes desperately searching the trees. She resumes in the direction she was headed. Tries to keep calm. But the woods are impenetrable. Layers of trees and shrubs, and then more trees. Deep in the cold dark places there are patches of left over snow. She's losing her bearings. 98",

She realizes the crosses are painted on the trunks of several trees, marking them for death. She shivers. 99                                                                 99 EXT. WOODS -EVENING She backs up, starts off in the opposite direction. And there it is again. The flashlight sweeping through the trees in the distance. She stops, close to screaming, then when the flashlight disappears, runs off in yet another direction. She slows to take a breath, notices the butts of several cigarettes still smoking in the dirt close to her feet. Scene 99Page 58 DELLA (muttering to herself) Shit! Oh Shit! She trudges on, pushing between the branches, no clue where she is headed. The further she treads, the quieter it becomes. So quiet she can hear her own footfalls and the sound of the trees breathing. Then, she spots the light again, in the distance, shining out over the forest. Thank God! She trudges up a slope ahead, clinging onto branches and shrubs to help pull herself up. 100                                                              100 EXT. LEDGE - EVENING The light grows closer. She climbs up onto a ledge. A loud noise startles her. It's music. Rap music. Blasting. Della pushes her way through to the edge of the trees. Sees.... 101                                                              101 EXT.   CLEARING - EVENING The woodland ahead slopes down into a clearing, where a huge ghetto blaster sits on a pile of felled trees. Young pines about to become Christmas trees. It's blasting out a hip hop anthem for a dead homie. A construction light illuminates the clearing. A ghostly Vinh, head hung low, moves to the music, bottle of beer in hand. Propped up against a tree stump sits the body of Huey, arms crossed over his torso, hood pulled up to cover his face. The scene is so surreal that Della is drawn closer. She creeps along the edge of the trees. As she moves, she kicks back on some dirt. It tumbles downhill into the gulch. She freezes. But nobody notices. She slips invisibly between the trees and watches as Tomas enters the clearing. Scene 101Page 59 Tomas stops and watches Vinh. Vinh continues to get into the music in his solemn Japanese punk style. The juxtaposition between the hard core rap music and the serious vibe that Vinh is sending out shows us that this is really important music to him. It's a theatrical tableau - Della overhead, looking down on the clearing. Vinh transfixed by the music. Tomas stone silent, watching Vinh. It plays out for a poignant moment. Like they're all part of some spiritual rite about to be consummated. Vinh pours some beer onto the ground at Huey's feet. A small tear runs down his stoic face. Then CLICK. The blaster is abruptly turned off by Chuckie who appears out of the shadows behind it. He stares a beat at Vinh like he can't believe what he's been seeing. Vinh keeps on moving like he's in a trance.",

She backs away from the edge and right into the sharp branch of a big old tree. The branch digs into that point in her shoulder she hurt earlier on the barbed wire. She reaches up to feel it and pulls her hand away bloody. She reaches into her coat pockets for a tissue. Nothing. Feels something in her pants pocket. She pulls out not a tissue but a sheet of folded paper. She unfolds it. It's Tammi's drawing. The one from the beginning. The stick figure family holding hands and \"Mommy - We love you\" written in stars. Della's lost in the drawing. Her eyes drink in every mark and color and word. She sees that the male figure is slightly separate. That the children stick figures have frightened eyes and cling to the female. That the sky is turbulent. The stars clear and bright. The words... A tear escapes from underneath her eyelid. Then another. A sob. Scene 102Page 62 She might never see her kids again. Another sob. She heaves with the release of emotion. More tears escape. Another sob. She tries to bite it back. Wills herself to stop. Finds that rage takes sorrow's place. Rage and self recrimination. Goddamit! She's gonna be raped and killed because of some stupid note! And God knows what will become of the kids. Kenneth always told her she had a temper. That she reacts without thinking of the consequences. This time the bastard was right. She looks again at the picture. Chuckie's voice booms out into the night.",

She picks the next. Rises slowly and softly from between the jagged branches clutching the lug wrench. Scene 105Page 68 And then there he is. Diving out of the trees towards her. Della raises the lug wrench. In the clouded moonlight it's an almost biblical image: a woman rising from the brush wielding an iron black cross. Tomas crashes towards her. Della swings the lug wrench, hard, intensely, directly at Tomas's face. There is a THUD as the sharp arm of the lug wrench catches him up under the chin. It sends him reeling. He goes down face first. Della gasps in horror, watches as: Tomas pulls himself up onto his feet, comes towards her once more. Della swings the lug wrench back and strikes him across the head. He spins, clutches at his head, then reaches towards her AGAIN. She loses it. She swings the lug wrench towards him.    All the years of pent up rage finally find their release. The wrench catches up under his nose with a sickening CRUNCH. It drives the cartilage up and into his face. Blood spurts from the wound. He staggers backwards.

Tomas crashes back into a tree. He loses consciousness. His body slumps slowly down the tree trunk to the dirt. Blood gushes from where the wrench meets his face. He looks like he's dressed for Halloween. Della just stares. Stares at Tomas, at what she did, what she had to do. Tomas' eyes are wide open, staring too, at nothing, dead. The horror of having killed someone overwhelms Della. She starts shaking with shock. Vinh cries out for Tomas",

Raises the toolbox. She looks around. A branch has broken from a tree and drags down into the stream behind her. This seems to bring her back to herself. She realizes it's only a matter of time before they come looking for her. She needs to get moving. She sets off downstream. She trudges through the shallow water. Her wet coat drags heavily. The stream must end somewhere, likely at the other edge of the woods. She trudges onwards, sweeping aside the branches of stooping trees, stepping around rocky obstacles in the stream. Forging ahead. She now needs to pee. GREAT. Her temper surges up. She looks for the right place to do it, realizes it's probably best to pee in the stream, so all trace of it will be dispersed. A leafless willow trails its dried up branches into the stream. She makes her way toward it. She lays the toolbox down and disappears between the branches. We see glimpses of her lifting her coat, pulling down her pants, pushing the crotch of her underpants to the side. We hear her shiver and the faint tinkle of water meeting the stream. More glimpses of her pulling up her underpants and pants, smoothing down her coat. She hoists her coat up again around her waist and picks up the toolbox. She plows down stream once more. Longing to see the light that will tell her she's at the edge of the woods, closer to the mall lights, closer to home. She swallows another wave of grief. Scene 106Page 74 The stream loops around ahead then splits into two. She follows it, picks the left fork. And then she hears it, the terrible sound of feet thundering down into the stream behind her. She doesn't even turn to see them. Just runs. Runs for her life. The glare of the flashlight blasts against her back. Freezing water splashes up her legs, soaking through her pants. Her feet slip and slide over wet rocks. But she keeps running. Vinh's behind her. She can feel his breath, the swipe of his hands as he grabs for her and misses. She runs even faster. She leaps over tree trunks that cross the stream. They leap behind her. She pushes through the hanging branches of several trees. Pushes them forward hard then lets them go as she passes, right into Vinh's face. He tries to duck but they hit him right in the eyes. He cries out, covers his eyes.",

But she's outrunning him. He charges back into the stream behind her. Della keeps on running through the stream, somehow trusting its direction. Vinh catches up with Chuckie. The boys are maybe twenty-five feet behind her. A SHOT rings out. Then a bullet races past her ear. Lodges in a tree just ahead of her. She almost loses her footing. She'd forgotten for just a moment, that they had a gun. Another shot blasts off into the night, skims her shoulder, hits the muddy bank of the stream. She flinches, braces herself, keeps going, adrenalin pumping harder than ever. Scene 106Page 75 The stream winds around a bunch of rocks ahead. For just a moment she's invisible to them. She uses it.

Tries to stay quiet as a mouse. Stops when she sees the flashlight sweep by. If she can get to the top, she can make another run for it. All of a sudden, it grows dark.

She removes it from the box and grasps it tight. Della rises slowly, remaining concealed behind the tree. She reaches up and softly places the toolbox deep in the junction of the first sturdy branch and the tree trunk. She pulls herself up onto the branch and edges in close to the trunk. She peeks between the branches. No sign of the boys. She pulls herself further up into the tree, branch by branch. The thin stiff outer branches, fringed with sharp little needles, fall like a jagged veil around her. She waits. She's high enough up to have a clear view of the landscape below despite the darkness.

Della frees the screwdriver she'd stuffed up her sleeve. She DRIVES the screw driver up into the base of Vinh's skull. Scene 110Page 79 Vinh screams. She thrusts and twists the tool. All the while she's tightly wound around him, intertwined, intimate as a lover. She drives the screw driver deeper in until she feels her knuckles dig into his stiff hair. Vinh's scream becomes a high keening wail. The screwdriver pierces the base of Vinh's skull. It protrudes through his mouth, knocking several teeth out in a stream of blood. His scream cracks into a death rattle as hers begins. They roll downstream. His arms are wrapped in a death grip around her. They roll until they crash full into a tree about two thirds of the way down. She feels his grip loosen and his body slump over hers. He becomes so heavy he almost crushes her underneath as he dies right there on top of her. She's trapped, suffocating underneath him, until she finds the strength to push him off. She crawls out from under his body. Pushing him away, sets him off rolling again. She tries to stand up but her legs are unsteady. Her head hurts so bad it's about to burst. The world around her shifts into a migraine zone. Trails follow trees, rocks, brush. The desire to close her eyes, to close it all out almost overwhelms her. Her shoulder aches too and there's a new pain in her arm where Vinh bit her. She sees blood has matted her sleeve, and rolls it up to find a nasty bite mark. There's a loud crash. Della freezes and moves only her eyes, looks around. It's Vinh's body hitting the stream below. Scene 110Page 80 Where was the light at the edge of the woods? Nowhere to be seen now that's for sure. She staggers along the slope, clutching onto tree trunks and roots as she goes. Della grabs for a shrub to help her cross a patch of muddy slope. Pulls it clean out by the roots. Loses her footing, reaches for the roots of an old tree. She pulls herself up. Plods once more along the slope, heading upwards in a diagonal through the darkness. She arrives at the top of the slope only to be met by more darkness. But there's a strange calm about her now. Like she's reached the eye of a terrible storm.",

She tries to pull away but he only presses harder. Neither can break away. It's unclear who's got the gun. They roll until she suddenly pulls away, sits up. But he has her and she has him in a fatal leg lock. Scene 111Page 89 And she has the gun. They look at each other. He smiles. He makes for the gun. She fires into his chest, just once, it's enough. His legs release. He slumps back.   Blood darkens his shirt. Gun smoke coils from the dark bullet wound. Blood seeps below him from the exit wound, spreading out in a dark puddle. His body surrenders to death. She stares down at him. A queasy silent moment passes. She stares at the gun in her hands. It feels so heavy, so unreal. His dead eyes stare. She reaches over and closes them gently. And she's light-headed, so light-headed she could just float away. Somehow she stands up. She looks back down at the body, not quite believing he could be dead. She sees her silver locket lying beside him in the pool of blood. She retrieves it. Uses her sleeve to wipe the blood away from its exterior. Inside the photos of her kids are still there; tiny photos of Tammis little thoughtful face and Terri's mischievous one look back at her. She snaps the locket closed. She searches the area for the rest of her belongings, finds her wallet, her purse, her diary, her lighter, her tampax box, a lipstick in the dirt. She sticks everything in her purse. She almost misses her pack of cigarettes. We see them half buried under the dirt. She scans the area once more finds them. The pack is empty but she takes it anyway. It's time to go home. 112",

Tree after tree disappears behind her until she sees the light ahead. That place where the rest of the world meets the woods. Scene 112Page 90 She peers through the last layer of trees like she would a curtain to her other reality, the one she almost left behind. The housing development is still there and not more than a hundred feet away is her car. She hears the sound of distant sirens. 113                                                              113 EXT. PERIPHERAL WOODS - EVENING She hurries across the clearing towards her car. Sees the trunk is open. Sees sheets of wrapping paper blowing about. Sees the big red bow tangled around a pine. She quickly gathers them, stuffs them in her purse. A moment of trepidation as she reaches her car. What if it's locked? What if the keys are gone? She presses the Ford's driver door handle and much to her relief, it opens. She sees the keys still dangling from the ignition. 114                                                              114 INT. EXPLORER- EVENING She climbs into the driver's seat and turns the key. No connection. No surprises there! 115                                                              115 EXT. PERIPHERAL WOODS - EVENING She steps back out of the car and looks nervously around like nothing good could ever possibly happen to her again. The hood is still ajar by a few inches, the weight of pine branches still pressing upon it. She uses the last of her strength to try push them away. A few smaller branches give way but the bigger one won't budge. She reaches under the hood for the bar and pulls hard. It scrapes along the inner surface of the hood as she forces it to prop the hood open to its maximum, about fifteen inches. The hood buckles but there's enough room for her to reach in. She fumbles about and finds the positive wire has come loose from its attachment to the battery. She re-attaches the wire and, Presto, the car lights up and the keys start to ping. She almost smiles as she forces the bar back down. The hood slams down after it. Scene 116Page 91 116                                                               116 INT. FORD - EVENING She quickly climbs back into the car and turns the keys. The engine sputters but doesn't fully catch. She turns the keys again - another wimpy sputter. Again, this time the sputter gathers momentum, catches for a second, gives up. She tries again, the sputter gathers momentum and catches for real. Della looks over her shoulder and backs up, pulls out of the tree, up and past the broken barrier and onto the road. She makes a tight U-Turn, sticks the car into four wheel drive and plows down the rough gravely road. 117                                                               117 EXT. ROUGH ROAD - EVENING She passes the Plymouth on her way. Sees its wheels lodged deep in the mud. Keeps going. 118                                                               118 EXT. EMPTY HOUSING ESTATE - EVENING She drives right on through the ghostly housing estate, slowing only to change back into drive as the road improves. Empty houses flash past like a movie in rewind. The lights of the mall grow closer. 119                                                               119 INT. FORD EXPLORER- EVENING She passes that stop sign, sighs. The barrier is open and the road up to the mall stretches freely ahead. She slowly inches out on to the road and commits to her return to \"civilization\". 120                                                               120 EXT.

MALL ROAD - EVENING The concrete blocks of the mall rise from the wastelands ahead on her left. She slows, ahead there's a small traffic jam at the entrance to the Mall road. Scene 123Page 92 123                                                                123 INT. FORD EXPLORER - EVENING She hears the siren before she sees the police car. God, she hopes they don't notice her smashed up windscreen, the fucked up side of the Ford. 124                                                                124 EXT. MALL ROAD - EVENING She edges slowly up to meet the line of cars. Watches as the police car circumvents the traffic and pulls into the Mall road, to join a police car that already has the Mall entrance road blocked off. 125                                                                125 INT. FORD EXPLORER - EVENING Of course.    How long has it been? That poor security guard. She checks the car clock. It's only 85 minutes since she left the house! Hard to believe. Feels like another lifetime. Another cop car whizzes past the line. How long before they come for her? She's got to get back to the kids. Della adjusts the rearview mirror. Her gaunt bloody face looks back.",

She passes the police cars, steals a cursory glance. She keeps checking her face in the mirror. The cars soon start to disperse in different directions. The Mall disappears behind her. She turns left onto an almost empty road. She can't wait to see her babies, make sure they're okay. How could anyone expect her to go the speed limit at a time like this.

FORD EXPLORER - EVENING At sixty-five she races across the railway track. She slows down to just above speed limit when she sees a car ahead on the adjoining road. With one hand guiding the wheel she grabs the lipstick from her purse. She carefully applies it in the rearview but her mouth is so parched it just cakes into her chapped lips. She wipes it away. 128                                                                128 EXT.

FORD EXPLORER - EVENING She applies some lipstick to her cheeks to give her some color. But she just looks odd. She ends up wiping it away with the back of her hand. Gosh, this car in front is really taking its sweet time. She decides to overtake. She accelerates to sixty. As she passes the driver stares at her car. She slows down so as not to arouse any more suspicion. She passes the familiar sign for \"Pleasant Valley Drive\". The road's empty ahead so she guns it to sixty-five. The closer she gets to home, the faster she wants to go. She tries to resist but can't. The speedometer hits seventy. The car hurtles into the night. Oh No, a red light ahead. And a car waiting to go in the opposite direction. She decides to slow for this one. Barely makes it - screeches to a halt. The driver in the forward facing car checks her out. She attempts to smile and look like a normal housewife. 130                                                                130 EXT. PLEASANT DRIVE - EVENING She waits for the car to pass, then hits the accelerator again. She signals right, turns abruptly into meet the gates of Pleasant valley Dream Homes. Scene 130Page 94 She rakes about in her purse for her chub card, can't find it. She presses the intercom. No one answers. She presses again. Still no answer. She backs out hard onto Pleasant Valley Drive. Luckily for her, the car she overtook a few minutes earlier pulls in. She tails the car tightly through the gates which scrape shut against her back bumpers. But she's in. She guns it along Pleasant Valley Crescent and slows as she approaches the sign for Pleasant Valley Boulevard. Checks herself in the mirror. Pulls into the boulevard. When she sees her house ahead a huge sob engulfs her. She snorts it back. Not yet. Her face hurts so bad with repressed emotion that it feels like it's made of stone. She pulls into the driveway. Smooths her coat. She glances at the gun, which lies on the passenger seat. She turns off the ignition. She looks back at the gun. She removes the car keys from the ignition. She glances at the gun. She looks at the house; it all looks normal. She takes a deep breath. She moves to get out of the car. She leans over, grabs the gun and sticks it in her purse. She finds her chub card inside. She sighs. 131                                                                131 EXT. DELLA'S HOUSE - EVENING She remembers her shoulder hurts when she climbs out of the car. That her arm hurts when she pushes the car door closed behind her. That her heart hurts when she sees the star of the tree still lying there in the snow. The whole side of the car is scratched to hell and the windshield is shattered. She makes her way down the path to the front door. She kicks off her wrecked muddy boots on the front step. Turns the adjoining key, on the car key chain, in the front door lock. Pushes open the door. 132                                                                132 INT.
