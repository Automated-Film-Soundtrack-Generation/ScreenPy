His head rests limply against the driver's window, which now looks out on nothing but snowbank. A link of blood trickles down the glass. Dead? She's not taking any chances. Without a sound she slips into her shoes, coat. Gropes for her cellphone among the detritus at her feet. Suddenly he stirs, groaning. She freezes. The seconds ticking by on the DASHBOARD CLOCK.

Our guy scrambles up front, slapping the air vents closed. Begins ripping off strips of duct tape to plaster over the vents to keep out the lethal chill.
