Bond outruns it, until, ahead of him A GRENADE EXPLODES, destroying the walkway and hurling Bond into the water. EXT. FACTORY The gunfight continues as the armed men take out Zukovsky's guards. Then, two of the assailants follow ZUKOVSKY and CHRISTMAS into... INT. FACTORY - NIGHT The chauffeur is shot and killed.

He leaps back to what's left of the building, picks up a flare gun.  He jumps down to a walkway at water level and cranks open a rusted GAS JET...he then waits for the Chopper to line up over it as it approaches Bond for the kill.... Bond fires the flare gun...

Bond slips out his gun holding it out of sight close to his leg so as not to alarm the civilians.  He steps into the cafe. EXT.

Bond is suddenly blind-sided by a vicious kidney punch which brings him to his knees.  He struggles to bring up his gun - but the Boa knocks it out of his hand. The Boa locks Bond's head in an unbreakable choke hold from behind.  Bond pulls on the massive arms - but to no avail. He glances down to his right - HIS GUN - just out of reach. Bond reaches out for it - his fingers just graze it. Suddenly the Boa's foot kicks out, knocking the gun across the room.  He tighten his grip and speaks in Bond's ear.",
