At the back of the room to the left, there is a dividing curtain hung by a cord at medium height. The curtain is drawn and a large bed with brass headboards is visible. The Algerian points in that direction; the captain signals for him to go there. They go forward silently, and push aside the curtain. There is a small light bulb hung on the wall beneath a small shelf covered with postcards and photos. The baseboard all around is more than three feet tall and is covered by majolica tiles. The Algerian points to a spot in the brick structure, on the back wall, between the headboard of the bed and a corner of the room. Marc and the captain have their machine guns ready. The captain goes near the wall, his breath drawn, and begins to examine it. He runs the fingernail of his thumb along the wall horizontally, between one row of tiles and another. He taps the tiles at different places until he hears the plaster in the interstices crumble. He looks at the bit of plaster that is left in his nail. He squeezes it in his fingertips; it is soft, newly laid. Then he bends over, places his ear to the wall, and listens. Suddenly he smiles. 5",

Two hands are moving; one over the other, they criss-cross with incredible speed; at the same time, they are shifting three small pieces of wood which appear to be identical.

Robust hands, thick, unusually agile for their size. The hands of Ali la Pointe, younger then, twenty- four years old. A European quarter of Algiers. Coming and going of people, automobile traffic. On the sidewalk a small group of European and two Algerian boys. Other passersby stop to watch. The group crowds around the stand where Ali la Pointe is playing his game. The entranced eyes of all present are staring at the pieces of wood. Ali's hands seem to move by themselves. His glance, always a bit sullen, apparently distracted, indifferent, passes from one face to another, and then to the street, from one side to another. At fifty yards, a policeman. Two Europeans, a man and a woman, are speaking to him in an excited manner, and nudging him along pointing to Ali.",

SIRENS and also in front of him. Another two policemen; they too are running. There is an intersection. At the corner, a cafe. GAY MUSIC. Young Europeans leaning against a shop window stop chattering and look. Ali reaches the corner, crosses the street, passes by the bar. There is a blond youth, about eighteen, who seems to be a student who stretches out his foot, and pushes a chair in front of him. Ali stumbles and falls. The youth attempts a laugh, and at the same time moves backward. Ali is lying face downward, but suddenly turns his head toward the youth and stares at him. Then lifting himself by his arms, he turns to look back. The police are now twenty yards away. Ali gets to his feet. For a split second, he hesitates. He hurls himself against the youth, headfirst. Using his head, Ali rams into the youth's face, striking him in the nose and splurting blood everywhere. The youth is unable to shout. He opens his mouth in the attempt, but the only result is a gurgling sound and blood. His friends intervene. Ali is surrounded. The police arrive. A mass of people jump on Ali, kicking him and striking him with their fists as long as they please. Finally the police aid Ali and disperse the crowd. Ali is now in handcuffs and being led away. More people have arrived. They are yelling, shouting insults, and spitting on Ali. Ali passes in their midst protected by the police. He pays no heed to the fist blows, the shouts, the spits, but seems neither to see nor hear, as if he were already resigned to having lost the battle this time, and were preparing to wait patiently for a better chance. He is walking with an unfaltering step. His face is emotionless, oval, swarthy. His hair black and wavy, his forehead low and wide; his eyes large and slanted with eyelids somewhat lowered, his mouth firm and proud.",

In the stronghold of the jeep are the two boxes sent from Paris. Early morning. The sky is pale blue. In the prison courtyard, the workers open the two chests and assemble the guillotine. It is possible to see it from the cell windows that face the courtyard. Faces of prisoners appear between the bars of some windows. The workers have disappeared. Only the delicate, makeshift structure of the guillotine is visible, its slender outline lengthened. 12",

A prisoner is standing on the urine bucket, and looks outside through the barred window. On the ground there are some mats which serve as beds. Nothing else. About ten prisoners are in a group, seated on the ground, and they are speaking in whispers. AD LIB DIALOGUE IN LOWERED VOICES. Two of them are playing with some stones on a chessboard drawn in the dirt; others are speaking among themselves. One is reading a Mickey Mouse comic book and laughing to himself. But all of them, in appearance and behavior, are distinguished from those who make up the more numerous group. These solitary men are different in some way, they are not ordinary delinquents. Ali la Pointe is alone, withdrawn from the others, seated on the ground, his shoulders propped against the wall, his knees raised. He is barefoot. On his left ankle, directly above his foot, are tattooed two words in print: TAIS-TOI. His shirt is unbuttoned and on his chest are other tattoos in a strange design. Ali looks at the group and seems to listen to their murmured words absent-mindedly. His expression is taciturn, reserved, and indifferent. Ali turns to the prisoner at the window.",

He makes his way along the sidewalk, and moves further away, balancing his heavy body at every step. Ali and the girl are about a yard away from him. They follow him, pushed along with the many others who are crowded on the sidewalk. Then the girl plunges her hand into the corn. In a second, she places the revolver in Ali's right hand. He holds it under his cloak. The policeman's back is a hand's-bredth away. But Ali does not shoot. He moves forward to pass by the policeman. Alarmed, the girl looks at him, and tries to hold him back. She shakes her head as if to speak. Ali smiles at her. His eyes have a hard glint. He moves a few steps past the policeman. Suddenly Ali turns, lifts his arm as if to push his way through, and then stretches out his hand with the revolver aimed. The policeman stops; his eyes are wide with fear. Instinctively he lifts his arms and opens his palms. Terror paralyzes him. Ali glances about him. Many people are moving away hastily, but others stand still in a circle and watch fascinated.

Now he is in rue Marengo. There is still some daylight. The street is crowded. The Algerian is unsteady on his legs. He stops and mutters something to himself. It is obvious that he is trying to hide his drunkenness. He begins to walk, his hand against the wall for support. He stumbles. The workbox falls, scattering brushes and cans of shoe polish on the ground. The Algerian bends down, and begins to pick up his tools. He is swearing. Others have seen him. A peddler points him out to a child of about ten. It is Petit Omar, who nods yes, then whistles. Another whistle answers him, then another and another. There are other children, at every corner of the street. They arrive in a run and gather together. Omar points to the drunk who is now moving away, and gives the order to attack. It is evident that this is not a game for them, but a duty. There is a chorus of brief shouting, of insults, and whistles. The drunk sees them approaching. He is terrified. He tries to quicken his step. They reach him quickly and surround him. They attack him and then flee, small yet elusive. They do not laugh even once; their faces are hard and cruel. The drunk swings around holding his workbox by its strap. Some children are hit; some fall. The drunk avails himself of this chance to escape, and retraces his steps to the staircase. He begins to descend toward the European quarters. But the children are again upon him. They are shouting more loudly now, and pushing him. He quickens his step, and staggering jumps the steps two by two. The children trip him and he falls. He is crying. He shields himself with his hands. The workbox has fallen and is rolling down the steps. The children are now on top of him, like small beasts on a carrion. They smother him, push him and pull him. They are no longer shouting. All of them are intent upon their efforts. Only the drunk is shouting despairingly. They succeed in moving him, and hurl him down the steps. He rolls downward, trying in vain to grab something with his hands. 21",

His hair is combed with care and covered with much hair cream. He is wearing a clean and newly bought white costume. Many of the others come to speak with him; the younger ones are joking and trying to provoke him. AD LIB REMARKS.

They are little more than children, twelve or thirteen years old, with soft complexions, white teeth, and shining eyes. They seem children who are playing, but beneath that veneer of gaiety, some anxiety is noticeable, emotions in suspense. The faltering voice of an old woman calls from the adjoining room. A girl leaves the group, lifts the dividing curtain, and nearing the bed where the old woman is lying, she kneels beside her. The old woman lifts her hand and places it on the girl's hair, caressing her tenderly. She speaks in a wavering voice, and her small yet kind eyes fill with tears. OLD WOMAN'S SPEECH IN ARABIC.

The nervous glance of Mahmoud scans their faces, then rests upon that girl who, with lowered eyelids, also glances quickly at him. Meanwhile the trays are being passed among the guests. Now the people turn to face the front door. A young man has entered carrying a briefcase under his arm. Behind him are two boys who seem to be his bodyguards, and are the only ones dressed in European clothes. Both of them have their right hands under their jackets, which are old and torn. They seem to be armed. They close the door, and remain standing on either side of it. The man with the briefcase walks toward the table. All present look at him respectfully. He smiles, responds to their greetings, shakes hands with all. But he refuses coffee and seems to be in a hurry. He sits down, places his briefcase on the table, opens it, and takes out a large notebook. From the open briefcase, the metallic butt of a sub-machine gun appears. On the cover of the notebook is written: NLF -- ALGERIAN  AUTONOMOUS ZONE. CIVIL RECORDS. He turns the pages of the notebook until he reaches the last written page. Then he glances up toward the people who, in the meantime, have taken their seats. He smiles, says a few words, then calls two names. Mahmoud walks forward stiffly, erect, his eyes staring straight ahead of him. The girl also walks forward, with a perplexed expression. They sit down next to each other, but without looking at each other. The ceremony consists of a few words. Finally the two youths look at each other. Mahmoud tries to smile, but he cannot. The girl's expression softens somewhat. Her glance is tender; she lowers her face quickly. Meanwhile the others recite the verses of the Koran in low voices. CHORUS. 30",

There are few people in the street. The guard walks slowly, glancing in the shop windows from time to time to admire his reflection. He stops, adjusts his cap, and smiles. An Algerian appears beside him; he is also young. The guard pretends to be interested in the photographic equipment which is on display, then moves on. The Algerian's arm springs forward and returns quickly to its place. He plunges the knife into the guard's neck. The guard opens his mouth wide to shout, but he cannot. The blood gurgles in his gashed throat. None of the few passersby has seen what happened. The guard falls flat on his face. Someone sees him and screams. The Algerian hurls himself on top of the soldier, opens his holster, takes his pistol, then gets up pulling the gun with him. The gun is fastened by a leather cord. The cord gets tangled in the gashed neck of the guard. The Algerian pulls in vain. He panics. He looks about him with terrified eyes. People approach hurriedly. They are shouting. The Algerian pulls the cord a second time, desperately. He regains his control, picks up the knife which is lying on the ground, and cuts the leather cord, thus freeing the pistol. The others have almost reached him and he is surrounded, but he manages to dodge them, and escapes. 31",

The street is sloping; on the right there is a high fence covered with advertising signs and cinematographic posters, all of them torn and full of holes; the emptiness on the other side is visible through the holes. The soldiers are chatting among themselves and looking at the posters. A soldier stops because he sees something moving on the other side of the fence. He points to it and shouts, but not in time. MACHINE-GUN FIRE INTERRUPTED BY SINGLE SHOTS. The soldier falls, the others remain motionless, unbelieving. They begin to run and scatter and look for cover. An Algerian appears on top of the fence. He moves like a cat, and jumps from the other side. His invisible companions continue to shoot. He is unarmed, and runs to the dead soldier. He grabs the machine gun and retraces his steps. The action takes place in a second. By now the soldiers too are shooting, but it is too late. 32",

A scooter with two Algerian boys passes by, rumbling noisily along the road. Then at full speed, it makes a sharp turn, retraces its steps and turns again. The boys seem to be showing off for fun. Meanwhile, the employees of the garage are leaving their work since it is lunchtime. The attendant at the gasoline pumps is left alone. The scooter stops in front of the high-test gasoline pump. The attendant is a European, an elderly man, who approaches them holding in one hand some bread he has just unwrapped. He detaches the pump handle of high- test, and asks how many gallons. One of the Algerians points a revolver at the attendant, and tells him to pour out the gasoline on the ground all around. The other, meanwhile, goes to the other two gasoline pumps, detaches the handles, and fastens them in an open position in order to empty them of gasoline. He uses two pieces of iron that he has brought with him to clamp the handles open. He stretches the pump hoses as far as they can go toward the garage and the parked cars. The gasoline flows all over the large square. The two youths are again on the scooter; they tell the European to move away. They have soaked a rag in gasoline and they light it. The gasoline continues to flow from the two open pumps. The European is by now far away, the scooter is already moving away, and at the same time, the boys hurl the lit rag into the square. It immediately bursts into flames. 35        COMMISSIONER's OFFICE. INSIDE. NIGHT. The night of the same day, in an office of the police commissioner's headquarters.

She walks slowly toward a bar, which has its tables outside, and already some customers. Near the bar, leaning against a wall, there is an Algerian who now begins to move and goes to meet the old woman. They greet one another with much warmth, like a mother and son who haven't seen each other for a long time. They embrace, and the man searches at her breast among the folds of her veil. He finds a revolver which is hung by a cord, and grabs it. They are at ten or twelve feet distance from the bar. At a table, there is a French soldier having coffee with cream, croissant, and an open newspaper. The Algerian continues to embrace the old woman, and aims from above her shoulders. Only one shot; the newspaper rips, the soldier tries to get up again, his face full of blood. Then he collapses on the table. The Algerian has hidden the revolver in the woman's veil. The two separate from their embrace. They seem terrified and surprised, and move away from each other in different directions while the people are rushing about and SHOUTING. 41",

He selects a bunch of mint, weighs it in his hand, and argues the price with the peddler. A policeman in the market passes nearby and watches. The youth waits a second, then turns toward the back of the policeman, and stretches out his arm. He has in his hand the bunch of mint; a revolver is hidden among the greens. He shoots twice. The French policeman falls down. The youth drops the mint with the revolver among the other herbs, and moves away in the midst of the crowd. 42",

The policemen come out of the police station hurriedly. WHISTLES, ORDERS, EXCITED CRIES. They turn the corner. Some rush to the man lying on the ground. Others jump into a jeep. Four of them jump on motorcycles that are lined up in the rack. They move off in two directions. At the same time, wails of police sirens moving nearer are heard in the distance. The street is deserted. There is no trace of the boy. People are seen at their windows. The officer is lifted by his arms. An ambulance arrives and stops, its siren at full blast, its doors wide open. The officer is placed inside. The motorcycles are racing through the sidestreets. The jeep converges on them, then reverses its direction, moving while balanced on two wheels. Passersby stop to watch, all of them Europeans. The siren's wail is at a high pitch. 43",

The combined sounds of the siren's wail and the rumbling of the motorcycles are heard approaching. Two motorcyclists appear in the street, passing by the road worker. One of them stops and turns around. The road worker moves backward to the street corner. He breaks into a run. His eyes are burning with fear, his face is anxious, undecided. From the windows, the people point to him, and shout after him. A jeep appears in the street in front of him. The motorcyclist approaches from the opposite direction. The Algerian stops running; he doesn't know what to do. From the windows, continuous SHOUTING. The Algerian leans against the wall, watches the scene, and begins to cry. The policemen jump down from the jeep and leap at him. The Algerian isn't able to speak, but only shakes his head. 44",

She removes the veil from her face. Her glance is hard and intense; her face is expressionless. The mirror reflects a large part of the room: it is a bedroom. There are three other girls. There is Zohra, who is about the same age as Djamila. She undresses, removing her traditional costume, and is wearing a slip ... There is Hassiba who is pouring a bottle of peroxide into a basin. She dips her long black hair into the water to dye it blond. Every action is performed precisely and carefully. They are like three actresses preparing for the stage. But there is no gaiety; no one is speaking. Only silence emphasizes the detailed rhythm of their transformation ... Djamila's lightweight European dress of printed silk ... Zohra's blouse and short skirt to her knees ... make-up, lipstick, high-heeled shoes, silk stockings ... Hassiba has wrapped her hair in a towel to dry it ... a pair of blue jeans, a striped clinging tee-shirt ... Her blond hair is now dry. She ties it behind in a ponytail. Hassiba has a young, slim figure. She seems to be a young European girl who is preparing to go to the beach. Continual silence. Djamila and Zohra have finished their preparations and sit down to wait. Hassiba is still barefoot. She is putting on her sandals, when someone knocks at the door. Djamila gets up and goes to open it. It is Kader. A quick attentive glance; Djamila ... Zohra ... Hassiba ... Hassiba responds to his look with a gay and somewhat coquettish expression; she says, stressing her French:",

The three girls are next to one another. The three bags are on top of the counter, a few steps away. With them is a thin Algerian about twenty-five years old. He has thick black hair, straight and combed neatly. He is wearing glasses. With his rough and nervous hands, he pulls out the towel and bathing suit from Hassiba's bag, then delicately and carefully, a square wooden box. He opens it, and turning to the girl, signals her to move away a bit. The girl steps back. In the box, there is a huge iron tube, sealed at both ends by two clock dials. Inside the tube, two batteries with wires are attached to the dials. The youth glances at his wristwatch, then adjusts the hands of the dials to six forty-five. He puts the bomb back into the box, closes it, and places it in the bag. He replaces the towel and bathing suit, then hands the bag to Hassiba. He is smiling slightly. Hassiba takes the bag and goes away. The box fits perfectly into Djamila's cosmetic-case. The youth opens it without removing it from the case, adjusts the two dials to six fifty, puts everything back in its place, and hands the case to Djamila. He smiles at her and she moves away. In the Air France bag, there are newspapers and magazines on top, and the same box. The youth adjusts the bomb to six fifty-five, arranges it again inside the bag, closes the zipper, and hands the bag to Zohra. He smiles at her. His smile is more genuine, less mechanical. There is less tension than before. The youth smiles at the girl and says in Arabic:",

There are two rooms; one at the entrance with an American-style bar, and one at the back with tables. It is Saturday, and at this hour many European families go out to have an ice cream. There is not too much confusion or uproar. The people are calm, they take their places at the bar and small tables, and eat their ice cream while chatting quietly. Hassiba enters, glances at the large clock above the cash register. It is half past six. She goes to the register and waits her turn. The different orders mingle; she orders a Coca-Cola. They give her the check. She pays. She goes to the bar; all the seats are taken. She gives her order and the ticket to the waiter. A man moves aside, looks at her, then steps down from his stool and offers it to her. Hassiba tells him that it doesn't matter, but the man insists. Hassiba thanks him and sits down. The man is about fifty, well groomed. He smiles again, and turns to chat with some friends. Hassiba settles herself more comfortably on the seat, then removes the bag from her shoulder. Holding it by the strap, she places it on the floor below the counter behind the brass railing used to lean one's feet. The waiter has brought her the drink. Hassiba drinks slowly, from time to time glancing at the clock. She finishes drinking. The bag is in a vertical position. Moving her feet slowly and carefully, Hassiba lets the bag slip on its side. She gets down from the seat, and points it out to the man who is standing next to her. HASSIBA I'm giving your seat back. MAN Are you already leaving, Miss? Hassiba smiles, nods yes.

Consequently, the military aspect is secondary to the police method. I know we are not fond of this word, but it is the only word that indicates exactly the type of work that we must perform. We must make the necessary investigations in order to proceed from one vertex to another in the entire pyramid. The reason for this work is information. The method is interrogation. And interrogation becomes a method when conducted in a manner so as to always obtain a result, or rather, an answer. In practice, demonstrating a false humanitarianism only leads to the ridiculous and to impotence. I am certain that all the units will understand and react accordingly. However, success does not depend solely on us. We need to have the Casbah at our disposal. We must sift through it ... and interrogate everyone. And here is where we find ourselves hindered by a conspiracy of laws and regulations that continue to be operative, as if Algiers were a holiday resort and not a battleground. We have requested a carte blanche. But it is very difficult to obtain. Therefore, it is necessary to find an excuse to legitimize our intervention, and make it possible. It is necessary to create it ourselves -- this excuse. Unless our adversaries will think of it themselves, which seems to be what they are doing. 74",

It is not a song, but a type of spoken chorus, an assembly of young voices, words whispered from the throat, both high and low, and sudden silent pauses. It is monotonous; but it is just such a repetition, always with the same pattern of tones -- high, low, then, silent -- that manages to transform itself into a motif, reach an excited pitch, and acquire breadth and solemnity. The sound fills the alleys, rises toward the long rectangle of sky, and moves farther away as if it were meant to be heard by all. The alley is narrow and sloping, with crumbling walls, tufts of grass, and refuse. It is located at the outer periphery of the Casbah -- the countryside is in the background. An Algerian is walking with large steps; a five-year-old child is behind him, moving quickly, stumbling from time to time on the pavement; although he does not cry, occasionally he calls to his father, who proceeds forward, and does not turn around. The chorus arises from behind them. It is incoherent. They stop in front of a door; they have arrived. The door gives way and they enter. 75",

It is gray and smoky dawn, a slow reabsorption of the night, an opaque light which is diffused, sprayed, frozen, to transparency, and rediscovers its outlines and perspectives; and finally, the sun, golden light, awakens all Algiers. To the north, the sea. To the south, the mountains and the Casbah, situated halfway along the coast. The Casbah, still, inert, expectant, on this first day of the strike ... The paratroopers are already at their places, one after another, at equal distances like links of a very long chain, strung through every alley, spreading to every sidestreet, twisting through the squares, climbing up the stairways, dividing, joining, and lengthening again. The silence is perfect; the camouflaged immobile forms seem to be part of the landscape. Then a brief and sharp hiss, a hundred whistles together. A signal releases the still forms: the attack begins. Doors are beaten down, shots, screams, rifle fire, machine gun fire; the doors opened or broken down; the courtyards, the houses, the rooms, invaded; the men who are trying to escape and who protest and try to save themselves.",

The terraces are emptied, men seized, beaten, dragged; all the men are forced outside in the alleys, the streets, the squares, every man is forced to face the wall, his hands up. 91",

The policeman has a raspy and bored voice; he stops speaking and leans the microphone on the table in front of him. He gets up, lights a cigarette, and moves away a few steps. Two children are among the women and behind the wooden horses barricades. They were waiting for this moment. They bend, seem to be playing, but one of them lifts the barbed wire as high as he can, from the ground. Petit Omar passes a wire underneath, its farthest end bent in the form of a hook. He moves it toward the microphone cord which is lying coiled on the ground. He succeeds in clasping it and pulls it toward him slowly. The cord unwinds, lengthens, stretches, until the microphone on the table begins to move, until it reaches the edge of the table, and falls ... The noise re-echoes in the loudspeaker, but no one pays any attention to it. Petit Omar waits a second, then begins to pull again. The microphone is dragged along the ground -- a humming sound -- it moves nearer, inch by inch, forward, under the barbed wire, until the children are able to take it, and disappear with it behind the women.",

They are emotional, proud, or angry, and look toward the sky where the voice seems to be diffused, as if those words should be written up above.

They are crowded into the hiding place, sitting on the floor, motionless, their eyes staring straight ahead, their breathing heavy. From outside, noises, voices that are fading in the distance. Silence. Then, a discreet knock, a remark in Arabic. The four breathe deeply, look at each other, then smile a little. Ali unslips the beam which, placed through an iron ring, is holding shut the door of the hiding place. Using the soles of his feet, he pushes against the square of wall: the light enters violently. It is not electric light, but daylight. Kader blinks his eyes to accustom them to the light, then goes out on all fours; after him, Ramel, and then the others. They leave the hiding place that Ali built in the wash-house on the terrace. 109",

The problem is: the NLF wants us to leave Algeria and we want to remain. Now, it seems to me that, despite varying shades of opinion, you all agree that we must remain. When the rebellion first began, there were not even shades of opinion. All the newspapers, even the left-wing ones wanted the rebellion suppressed. And we were sent here for this very reason. And we are neither madmen nor sadists, gentlemen. Those who call us fascists today, forget the contribution that many of us made to the Resistance. Those who call us Nazis, do not know that among us there are survivors of Dachau and Buchenwald. We are soldiers and our only duty is to win.

White beach, fine sand, transparent sea, bodies stretched out in the sun, golden skin of girls; girls in bikinis, sensual, smiling, young men with narrow hips, with muscles well cared for, cheerful youth, naturally happy, enviable. The children are building sand castles near the water's edge; the beach is shaped like a half-moon with rocky reefs at both ends ... A September Sunday, warm and calm. Ali is leaning on the wall. He is wearing a white wool cloak. Only his eyes are visible ... the eyes of a hungry tiger perched above a path, on the lookout for innocent prey. Eyes that now gleam, cruel eyes, tension dilating the pupils ... Then again the calm, a gloomy calm, a gratifying tension. The place is right, and the victims couldn't be better ones. Ali moves, leaves the wall, crosses the street to a large city sanitation truck, one of those metallic trucks with no visible openings. A young Algerian is at the steering wheel, a street cleaner. He is leaning his thin face on the wheel. His hands are dirty, by now unwashable from years of work. Ali has climbed into the cab. The truck is in motion and leaves. 132",

There is a mattress on the table and Petit Omar is lying on top, asleep. Ali is lying on a mattress on the ground, fully dressed, with his machine gun by his side. His eyes are open, and he is listening to the far-away sound of a motor. He looks at his watch, gets up, and goes to open the door. Outside there is the first gray light of dawn. The sound is heard more clearly and seems to be moving nearer. Ali returns to Petit Omar, stays a minute looking at him, then shakes him roughly. The child gets up immediately. He is trembling, as if he had slept with taut nerves, and jumps down quickly from the table. His eyes are open, but he is still sleepy. Ali smiles for a moment, and runs his fingers through Omar's hair.",

She closes the door. She puts the coffee cups back on the tray, and hides everything in the sink. She goes to the other side of the curtain. Ali is entering the hiding place. The other three are already inside. Ali pushes the movable piece of wall toward him, and the woman helps him. Then, she takes a can from the night table; it is full of plaster mixed with coal dust. The woman spreads the paste in the joints between the bricks of the wall and the closure of the hiding place. At the same time, shouting, shots, and the footsteps of paras are heard. As soon as she has finished, the woman slips into bed under the sheets. The paratroopers break into the room shouting, and make the woman get up. They drag her outside on the balcony. 136",
