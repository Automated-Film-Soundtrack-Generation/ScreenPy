There's a sense of ritual and order: the chapters of transforming the hog into food. Sara is inside the cabin, the door open onto the yard. She holds the baby by the fireplace, swaddled up tight. She tries to put him to her breast, but he won't feed. She puts Ethan back in his crib, comes outside. Now Inman is butchering the hog, chopping down either side of the spine to make two sides of meat. Now Sara is holding up a sheet of hog fat, as if it were a lace shawl. Now she's rendering the fat into lard. Now Inman's salting the two hams. Now Sara's washing the intestine. She sings all the while -- I dreamed that my bower was full of red swine and my bride bed full of blood -- they don't really converse. Inman continues to work. Sara goes back inside to Ethan's crib. Inman glances back, but can hardly bear to, her anxiety so palpable. THE BABY IS DEAD. She looks at it. She takes it up in her arms. Kisses its forehead. Makes a strange stifling noise. Inman doesn't look at her. She comes out again, shovels some of the food into a plate, serves it up to Inman, gently touching him as she does so. Then serves out food for herself. Inman starts to eat.",

HIS FIRST SHOT KNOCKS JO FROM HIS HORSE, THE SECOND MO, WHO FALLS INTO THE SNOW, BLEEDING FROM THE GROIN AND SCREAMING. The riderless horse gets tangled up with the others. Inman is in the trees, shots around him. He doesn't move away from, but towards the riders inside the line of trees. Grayling charges him, riding into the trees. INMAN SHOOTS HIM, THEN RUSHES FROM THE TREES, FIRING, MISSING BOSIE, WHO RIDES AWAY, EVIDENTLY NOT RELISHING THE FIGHT, AND THROWS HIMSELF AT TEAGUE, WHOSE HORSE IS BUCKING WILDLY. Teague's carbine fires an involuntary shot into the air. Inman yanks the gun from his hand with his own left hand and lets go the shotgun barrel of the Lemats with the other, the big pistol almost leaping from his hand with the recoil. TEAGUE'S CHEST OPENS OUT AS HE'S THROWN OFF THE HORSE. Mo is still screaming. Inman walks over and shoots him in the head, then walks to Teague, who is saying something, the blood blotting the snow under him. Inman studies him, picks up the Spencer carbine, turns to look where Bosie has gone, steps up onto Teague's horse, reins the horse in, and trots it over to the prostrate Teague, LEANS OVER AND SHOOTS HIM DEAD. He turns the horse in the direction Bosie had headed. He can't see horse or rider, but in the stand of Hickory Trees ahead, THE GUSTS OF STEAMING BREATH betray them both. He rides slowly towards the stand of trees.",
