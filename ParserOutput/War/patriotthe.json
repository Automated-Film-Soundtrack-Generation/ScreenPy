The perfectly tended fields are ripe with barley, hops, alfalfa and tobacco.  Two sturdy brothers, NATHAN, 13 and SAMUEL, 12, work one of the fields, rhythmically swinging scythes through the barley. The house, built of native brick, is well-constructed and well-maintained.  There's a barn, a workshop and a forge. It is a home of substance rather than wealth.  On the front porch, MARGARET, 11, pumps a butter churn while her brother, WILLIAM, 6, watches. GABRIEL, 18, strong and handsome, walks out of the woods with a musket in his hand and a dozen game-birds over his shoulder.  At his side walks THOMAS, 14, also carrying a musket. INT.  WORKSHOP - DAY A perfect colonial workshop, fastidiously arranged with every conceivable tool of the period.  A foot-powered lathe.  A drop-forge.  A lifting saw.  Racks of tools, planes, hammers, augers, drills, blocks, all hanging in their places.  All very well-worn. FRANCIS MARION methodically works his lathe, turning a piece of hardwood, shaving off tiny curls of wood with a razor-sharp chisel.  He's in his late-forties, strong and weathered.  His hands, though big and callused, handle the chisel with a surgeon's precision.  Self-educated and self-sufficient, he has built himself, as he built his farm, brick by brick, from the coarse clay of the earth. A finely-made rocking chair, missing only the dowel on which Marion is working, sits on the work table.  The chair is a work of art, thin and light, a spider-web of perfectly turned wood, no nails, no glue. Sitting on the woodpile, SUSAN, 4, a silent, stone-face wisp of a child, watches her father. Marion takes the piece of wood out of the lathe, carefully fits it into the chair, inserts a peg and taps it into place.  Then he steps back and appraises his handiwork. He picks up the chair and hooks the top rail to a scale, countering with a three-pound weight.  The chair floats. Marion blows softly on the weight which sinks.  Susan nods, so far, so good.  Marion puts the chair on the floor and walks slowly around it, checking every angle. Then, the acid test.  He takes a deep breath and lowers himself onto the seat, gingerly adding an ounce at a time. Not a creak.  He smiles and sits back with a sigh. CRACK!  THE CHAIR SPLINTERS under Marion's weight, DUMPING HIM on his ass on a pile of broken wood.",

A THUNDEROUS SOUND rises, louder and louder.  HORSES HOOVES. From around a bend, a detachment of cavalry gallops: British GREEN DRAGOONS.  The finest light calvary in the world.  Hard, strong men.  Excellent horsemen.  Their mounts are powerful, muscled and perfectly cared for.  The Dragoons themselves are all hardened veterans, marked with the blood and dirt of a recent battle.  Tired and vigorous. They're armed to the teeth.  Each carries a flintlock carbine, a brace of pistols and a sword.  Some carry lances as well.  Regimental flags flutter.  They are forty of the most imposing, frightening horsemen imaginable. And at their head, the most imposing man of all, LT. COLONEL BANASTRE TARLETON.  \"The Butcher.\"  Aristocratic. Strong.  Dark.  A powerful horseman on the best mount of the entire troop.  Decorated.  Imperious.  No temper, just hard, cold authority.  His men struggle to keep up with him. Behind them, two dozen LOYALIST MILITIA CALVARY (American civilians loyal to the crown).  Nasty, local men. Civilian clothes.  Riding at their head is AMOS GASKINS, grizzled, lower-class, wearing ill-fitting patrician's clothing. AROUND A BEND The three wounded Patriots who just left Marion's farm hear the horses coming, stand on the side of the road, raise their arms and a white cloth of surrender. The Green Dragoons rein in.  Tarleton stops in front of the three men.  He motions for one of his men to lower his weapon.  Then he speaks calmly, quietly, to the wounded men.",

The booty includes dozens of BRASS MUSICAL INSTRUMENTS, some of which Marion's men BLARE in celebration. -- Marion rides with about one-hundred-fifty men. -- Marion, Gabriel, and some of the other men watch as the flaming supports of a BURNING WOODEN BRIDGE collapse into a river. -- A seething Cornwallis stands at the same spot, looking at the charred, now cooled, remains of the bridge.

They stop to catch their breath.  A SOFT WIND blows. Marion turns his head as if listening for a faint voice. He hears nothing.  He snaps the reins and continues plowing. INT.  MARION'S ATTIC - LATE AFTERNOON Dark.  Thomas steps up into the attic.  He finds a trunk and opens it.  Lifting out some blankets, he uncovers a trove of Marion's old military gear -- a worn battle coat, a box of medals, a military sword, rusted into its scabbard. Thomas puts on the coat, which hangs off his narrow shoulders.  He stands in front of a dusty mirror, appraising himself, then stops as he hears FOOTSTEPS coming up the stairs. It's Marion, tired and dirty from his plowing.  Thomas grimaces, expecting him to be angry, but sees him shake his head gently.",

BURIAL GROUND - WOODED ENCAMPMENT - MORNING Marion finishes burying Gabriel, putting the last shovelfuls of dirt on the freshly turned earth.  He stands next to the grave, looking down, and says a silent prayer. EXT.  YORKTOWN ROAD - DAY The AMERICAN FORCES are on the move, all heading in the same direction.  Continentals and militiamen fill the road.  Some on horseback, others in wagons, most on foot. Among them, a mixed unit of Continentals and Marion's brigade, at the head of which ride Lee, Dalton, Abner and Rev. Oliver. Behind them, a single horseman rides up.  It's MARION. Without speaking, Marion rides up alongside Lee.  They exchange nods. Marion rides between Dalton on one side and Rev. Oliver on the other.  They pass a sign that reads, \"Yorktown.  20 miles.\" EXT.  YORKTOWN OVERLOOK - DAY The road to Yorktown skirts an OVERLOOK with a view of the town and the harbor.  A few dozen arriving Patriots have stopped to look out at the view.  Marion, Lee, Rev. Oliver and Dalton join them. The French Fleet is visible in the harbor.  The British encampments are on a pair of peninsulas, one jutting out from land, the other jutting toward the land from a large island.  In a semi-circle around the landward peninsula, the beginnings of the Patriot encirclement are visible. It's a grand and impressive sight. Marion and the others turn their horses and head down the road toward the American lines. EXT.  YORKTOWN ENCAMPMENT - DAY AN INTERMITTENT EXCHANGE OF CANNON FIRE.  Not a battle, but pre-battle pot shots.  Behind the American embattlements, hundreds of American and French soldiers drill, make camp and build secondary fortifications. MARION, stands behind a barricade, trying to get a view of the British defenses.  A RUNNER, a boy about fifteen, dashes up to Marion.",

YORKTOWN BATTLEFIELD - DAY The sun has risen but a heavy ground fog limits visibility to a few dozen yards.  Men move like ghosts. THE CAMERA finds waiting squadrons of men but in the mist. There is no overview, just separate detachments: An orderly regiment of CONTINENTAL CAVALRY, mounted, waiting, steadying their horses. Two long lines of CONTINENTAL INFANTRY RESERVES... An American Command, including Washington, LaFayette and two dozen staff officers, attended by riders and runners... And, finally, MARION AND HIS MEN, who stand in the middle of a long line of Patriot militia in the center of a long, valley-line depression. They stand silently, unable to see anything other than each other and the gently slope of the dew-covered grass in front of them. They're all grim.  They know what's coming. Then, the SOUND OF A SINGLE DRUM, heard but unseen, coming from over the slope... Then, MORE DRUMS, more and more, A COMPETITION OF DRUM BEATS... Marion's men listen, turning their heads, trying to imagine what is happening on the other side of the rise in front of them. MARION MOTIONS FOR HIS OFFICERS, Dalton, Scott, Rev. Oliver and several other Patriot militia officers from other units.  They quickly gather around. MARION The British army believes in officers.  I believe in soldiers.

They hear the SOUND OF THOUSANDS OF BOOTS ON WET GRASS, advancing... THE CAMERA WATCHES THE FACES OF MARION AND HIS MEN as they listen to an unseen army approaching. ON MARION'S FACE we see him hearing every sound and we see FLASH CUTS of what he knows he's hearing: The BOOTS OF THE UNSEEN SOLDIERS... Shouldered muskets CLICKING against pack buckles... SILENCE at a stop... MORE DRUMS... The men around Marion wait. THEN, THEY SEE IT... A MASSIVE WALL OF RED appears over the rise in front of them... Thousands of Redcoats, in perfect formation, marching in lockstep, straight for them. Marion sees the fear on his men's faces, but none of them move... The BRITISH DRUMS GROW LOUDER AND LOUDER... it's almost enough to drive a man to flight... almost. The CAMERA explores the faces of Marion's men, faces that we know, Rev. Oliver, Scott, Abner, Marion.  All are frightened but all are motionless. Closer and closer, the British line approaches... The American's don't move... Then, the BRITISH LINE STOPS... At a flurry of commands, the Redcoats ready their muskets, then aim... Still, Marion and the Americans don't move... DEAD SILENCE... Then, a single, thin voice calls out from the British lines... IN A THUNDEROUS, MASSIVE VOLLEY, three thousand British muskets fire simultaneously... just as the entire line of AMERICAN MILITIAMEN DIVE TO THE GROUND... Many Americans are saved by the move but many, many others are torn apart by the British musketballs... THE AMOUNT OF SMOKE IS INCREDIBLE... it obscures everything.  Each musket spits out a billow of think white smoke a dozen feet in front of it and three thousand of them just fired.  The massive, opaque white cloud quickly spreads over the entire battlefield. The astonished Redcoats instantly reload... And watch as the Americans rise in DISORDERLY PANIC and FLEE... Some Redcoats laugh... ON A RISE BEHIND THE BATTLEFIELD, CORNWALLIS, watches through his spyglass, trying to get a sense of what's happening before the spreading cloud of musket smoke obscures everything.

The mass of the British infantry charges after the fleeing Patriot militiamen... The Redcoat infantry grows disorderly as it runs... TARLETON AND THE BRITISH CAVALRY THUNDERS to the head of the Redcoats, closing in on the fleeing Patriots.  The cavalry swords are drawn and raised for a slaughter... THEN SUDDENLY Stepping into view from behind a low, grass covered rise, a SOLID LINE OF BLUE APPEARS, rock solid... It open up, allowing the fleeing Patriots to pass through it like water... then it closes again, becoming a solid blue wall... MARION, HIS MEN AND THE ENTIRE MASS OF FLEEING MILITIA STOPS DEAD, turns and joins the blue American line... A flurry of orders, then the BLUE WALL ERUPTS WITH A VOLLEY of musket fire that stops the disorderly British advance in its tracks... Hundreds of Redcoats fall instantly... Hundreds of Green Dragoons and their horses fall with them... The effect of the volley is devastating...' The American timing is perfect... Again, the amount of SMOKE is astonishing... visibility drops to less than twenty feet in most places... Drifting smoke opens up glimpses of the battle here and there but it is primarily a battle of sound... Men simply follow the men in front of them...

Slashing through the Redcoat infantry... His sword sinks into the stock of an upraised British musket and is pulled from his hands... Marion quickly kills the Redcoat with his pistol... THEN, THROUGH THE SMOKE, MARION CATCHES A GLIMPSE OF TARLETON... Marion freezes... his eyes locked on Tarleton who is fighting a pitched battle, making his way toward the perimeter of the field, trying to escape back to the British lines... Seeing nothing but Tarleton, Marion hurriedly tears open his weapons pouch and pulls out one of the bullets made from Thomas' lead soldiers...

Marion wavers... Then he takes a last look at Tarleton and heads off to help the faltering Patriots... TARLETON sees the movement of Marion and his men and sees Marion himself, his back exposed... AT THE PATRIOT LINE... Marion, Dalton and two dozen other militia cavalrymen arrive at the same time, beating back the Redcoats... As blue-uniformed Continentals reform the line, FIRING AT THE FALTERING REDCOATS... TARLETON sees Marion and fights his way toward him... Marion is oblivious, concentrating on holding the American line... Tarleton mounts a terrified, riderless horses, draws his sword and gallops back toward the British lines, on a path that takes him directly past Marion...

Marion, stunned, exhausted and surprised to be alive, watches Tarleton fall... Marion stands over Tarleton's body and gives himself a moment of bitter triumph, then he turns back to the battle at hand... Marion picks up Tarleton's sword and runs to the AMERICAN LINE which stiffens as Dalton and Rev. Oliver are joined by Marion and a dozen other Patriots... The blue-uniformed Continentals reform their line... Marion looks back toward Tarleton but finds that his body, along with the place and the moment of his death, has disappeared into the smoke of the battle... Marion and his men fight on... then, Redcoats start fleeing the field... First one Redcoat at a time... then more and more... EXT.  YORKTOWN - DAWN The next day.  Silence.  The battlefield, as far as the eye can see, is covered with the debris of war, dead men and scattered weapons. The British have retreated back behind their defenses but have left many of their men on the field. The Patriots, regulars and militia, wait behind their barricades. Then, a single figure appears on one of the British parapets.  A DRUMMER BOY, no more than ten-years-old. Behind him, a single British officer. They boy begins to beat the drum.  The officer raises a white flag. In the American lines, the men see the flag.  Some call out, some cheer, some laugh, most, among them MARION, simply take a deep breath.  It's finally over. EXT.  YORKTOWN FIELD - DAY A massive ceremony, carefully orchestrated, laid out on the cleaned up battlefield. Thousands of men, everyone in his place, as if well- directed actors in a grand theatrical performance. The French and American armies, fifteen thousand men between them, stand in perfect formation on either side of the field, forming an avenue for the British army which marches out of it's fortification. At the head of the avenue, WASHINGTON AND HIS STAFF stand waiting. A musical band of Continentals, thirty men strong, loudly plays a tune, \"The World Turned Upside Down,\" a jaunty British air with a melancholy undercurrent. CORNWALLIS marches with his officers, eyes straight ahead, covering his agony as best he can. As he walks along the avenue he passes the remnants of the South Carolina militia. MARION, standing with Dalton, Rev. Oliver, Abner, Scott and the rest of his surviving men sees Cornwallis pass... CORNWALLIS glances over, noting what unit they are by a tattered battle standard that flies over them.  It's only a glance and he DOESN'T PICK OUT MARION, who is just one man among the many... AT THE HEAD OF THE AVENUE Cornwallis reaches Washington.  They exchange unheard formal greetings. Cornwallis, DRAWS HIS SWORD AND HANDS IT TO WASHINGTON... FIFTEEN THOUSAND MEN, American and French, RAISE THEIR VOICES in a CHEER OF ASTONISHING VOLUME... With every other pair of eyes directed toward the ceremony between Washington and Cornwallis, MARION quietly and unnoticed, slips out the back of the formation and walks away. EXT.  YORKTOWN - DAY The surrender ceremony continues.  Marion, on the fringe of the field, finishes saddling his horses and prepares to leave.  LEE walks out of the crowd and joins him.  They lock eyes for a moment, then Marion mounts up.",
