The brothers find Goeth in the crowd looking at them like, Come on, for Christ's sake play something else. Which they do -- defeated -- some innocuous Von Suppe. Goeth turns back to one of his guests. Glancing back, as they play, to the corner, the Rosners see the gloomy SS officer getting slowly up from his chair. He stands there for a moment, staring at nothing, then slowly makes his way out onto the balcony where he stands in the night air, absolutely still, in silhouette to the Rosners.
