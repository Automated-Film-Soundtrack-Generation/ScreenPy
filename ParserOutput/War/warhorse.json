They whip past the back of the line of marching soldiers. It's clear what is happening - Gunther is on Topthorn - and has hold of Joey, on a loose rope, galloping beside him. Gunther, galloping along the line of soldiers, spots what he is looking for, a red pennant unfurled and flapping in the wind, tied onto Michael's pack. Gunther speeds toward him. This was his plan all along. And in an instant he is beside him and without Michael ever realizing, he suddenly finds his arms and legs akimbo, as he is yanked out of the line and dragged along the ground, desperately close to Joey's pounding hooves. Michael looks at the soldiers beside him - he looks at the skyline of violence ahead...but before he can decide, he feels his brother's arm - pulling him upwards.

We see the explosion and the machine gun stop. Albert sprints over the top again and makes it all the way into the German trench. Albert runs through the trench, which seems curiously empty. Albert swings round as he sees the startling face of a gas- masked German holding a rifle on him. Albert readies his bayonet but the man is dead, slumped backwards against the side of the trench still upright. Albert spins round, his bayonetted rifle in front of him, ready for action, but there is only the ghostly sight of dead German soldiers. Albert is alone, everyone else is dead. All the dead wear gas masks. More British soldiers drop into the trench, among them Andrew. He stumbles in the mud, drops his rifle, recovers it, and races through the trench.
