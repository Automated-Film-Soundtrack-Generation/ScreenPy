He is as surprised as they \n\n               are, but recovers quickly and swings a big monkey wrench at \n\n               Indy. Indy grabs the swinging arm and the two men tumble out \n\n               into the open, wrestling. Marion remains hidden, moving fast \n\n               among the crates.\n\n               The first German Mechanic, who is just pulling the fuel hose \n\n               from the tank truck to the plane, sees the combatants and \n\n               runs to help his countryman. He is almost upon them when \n\n               Indy puts the Second German away with a devastating left - \n\n               right - left combination.

The roll toward the rear of the Flying \n\n               Wing and its lethally spinning reversed propellers.\n\n               In the cockpit of the Flying Wing, the Pilot has been fiddling \n\n               with his gauges just prior to shutting off his engines. Now \n\n               he notices the fight going on outside.\n\n               The fistfight between Indy and the German Mechanic has taken \n\n               on a new stomach-tightening dimension. The men are fighting \n\n               and flailing in and out between the spinning props at the \n\n               back of the plane's wings. Each man comes within inches of \n\n               becoming instant mincemeat.\n\n               The Pilot slides away the top of his cockpit and stands up. \n\n               He pulls a Luger from his side and points it, waiting for a \n\n               clear shot at Indy. The German Mechanic kicks Indy away from \n\n               him and the Pilot aims his pistol. Suddenly, Marion appears \n\n               behind the Pilot, standing on the opposite wing, and bashes \n\n               him over the head with one of the blue blocks that was holding \n\n               the tires. The Pilot drops down into the cockpit, his body \n\n               falling on the throttle. The engines roar louder, revving \n\n               up. The plane begins to roll, rotating around its one still-\n\n               blocked set of tires. Marion grabs onto the cockpit to keep \n\n               from slipping into the props. She bends into the cockpit, \n\n               trying to pull the Pilot's body off the throttle. No luck. \n\n               She grimaces and climbs inside. Her shoulder bumps the top \n\n               of the cockpit; it slides tightly shut above her.\n\n               Under the moving wing, Indy delivers a knockout rightcross \n\n               to the German Mechanic which sends him staggering back toward \n\n               a roaring propeller. Indy's grimace registers the man's demise \n\n               and a fine mist of blood wafts toward him.

Indy backpedals away from the plane, \n\n               his eyes searching the scene for Marion. Suddenly, he is \n\n               shocked to see her in the cockpit.

The guard rail \n\n               is now bent.\n\n               In the cab of the truck, Indy and the Truck Driver again \n\n               stop trying to choke each other long enough to negotiate the \n\n               turn together. The bumper of the truck hits the broken guard \n\n               rail and sends it flying off the cliff. The truck, however, \n\n               holds the road.\n\n               In the rear car, Gobler and Belzig are trying to see through \n\n               the thick clouds of dust. Suddenly is clears completely. \n\n               Unfortunately for them, this happens because their car has \n\n               shot out into space at the hairpin turn. They are flying to \n\n               their final reward. Belzig, eyes wide behind his evil \n\n               spectacles, screams as he goes.\n\n               In the cab of the truck, the Truck Driver is distracted by \n\n               the sight of the flying staff car. Indy plasters him and he \n\n               tumbles out.\n\n               Far, far below, Belzig's staff car explodes on the rocks.\n\n               In the back of the truck, a TOUGH SERGEANT takes command of \n\n               the situation. He picks out six Armed Nazis and motions for \n\n               them to start climbing around the outside of the truck to \n\n               the cab. With some trepidation the lucky ones begin that \n\n               maneuver. The truck is swerving like crazy.\n\n               In the front staff car, the Armed Guard aims his submachine \n\n               guns back at Indy, alone now in the truck's cab. Shliemann \n\n               knocks the barrel roughly away.", "start": 179705}, {"name": "direction", "stop": 187278, "raw_text": "Indy sees this from the cab and reacts by speeding up, putting \n\n               even more pressure on the Blond Driver.\n\n               Along the back of the truck, Armed Nazis are edging up toward \n\n               the cab, three on each side. They hang on as the truck rounds \n\n               a corner and goes into a straightaway that leads through a \n\n               short tunnel.\n\n               In the cab, Indy has been concentrating on the lead staff \n\n               car. Now, just before entering the tunnel, he looks in the \n\n               side view mirror and sees the Nazis on his side. A quick \n\n               glance to the other mirror reveals the others. As the truck \n\n               sweeps into the tunnel, we see Indy just start to turn his \n\n               steering wheel - he is going to sideswipe the walls of the \n\n               tunnel\n\n               At the other end of the tunnel, we hear the roar of the two \n\n               engine and two long, screeching, scraping sounds. The lead \n\n               staff car shoots out of the tunnel, then the truck, its sides \n\n               cleaned of Nazis.\n\n               In the rear of the truck, the Tough Sergeant is looking with \n\n               distaste back at the tunnel. There remains only him and two \n\n               Armed Nazis with the Ark. He sends these two climbing up \n\n               over the top of the truck.\n\n               In the lead car, the Blond Driver is being pressed hard by \n\n               Indy, who now edges up to bump them from the rear. Suddenly \n\n               the Armed Guard next to the Driver sees the two Armed Nazis \n\n               appear on the top of the truck. Without thinking, he starts \n\n               to point them out to Shliemann, then realizes his stupidity.\n\n               In the cab, Indy has seen this and is at first mystified. He \n\n               checks his sideview mirrors. Then he figures it out and slams \n\n               on his brakes. The brakes lock, the wheels burn and the truck \n\n               skids to a dusty halt. The two Armed Nazis fly off the truck, \n\n               over the cab to the road in front. Indy immediately hits the \n\n               gas again. The two Armed Nazis, just aiming their weapons, \n\n               get wiped out.\n\n               In the rear of the truck, the crated Ark is bouncing all \n\n               alone, no one in sight, because -\n\n               The Tough Sergeant is on the top of the truck, making his \n\n               way steadily forward. This guy clearly knows what he's doing. \n\n               A submachine gun is slung across his back.\n\n               The truck and the staff car race through a series of S-curves. \n\n               In the staff car, Belloq and Shliemann spot the Tough Sergeant \n\n               as he reaches the front of the truck's top and begins to \n\n               lower his submachine gun barrel toward the cab. Indy is \n\n               unaware. Belloq and Shliemann exchange looks. Then Shliemann \n\n               yells to the Armed Guard in the front seat.\n\n               The Tough Sergeant has a line on Indy. He points his gun. \n\n               The Armed Guard blasts away at the truck. The Tough Sergeant \n\n               dies in a hail of bullets and flies off.\n\n               Indy, who has ducked at the gunfire, is confused. But when \n\n               he sees the Armed Guard up front lower his gun, Indy again \n\n               floors it and begins bumping the staff car in earnest.\n\n               The road is almost down to a level now. In the distance - \n\n               Cairo. The road takes a little dogleg just before reaching \n\n               level ground again. Just as the staff car is about to make \n\n               the turn, Indy smashes them from behind. The staff car flies \n\n               off the road and down a twenty foot embankment. Indy takes \n\n               the truck speeding down the road and off toward Cairo.\n\n               In the staff car, the occupants are bruised but safe. \n\n               Shliemann points at the departing truck and yells at the \n\n               Blond Driver.

Only by grabbing the base of the aftmast light \n\n               does he keep from being swept away.

Still the ocean comes up to meet him. \n\n               Soon the top of the turret is under water and the radio mast \n\n               is disappearing. Indy shifts his grip to the periscope, \n\n               working his way up it and hanging on for dear life as the \n\n               ocean whips at his body.
